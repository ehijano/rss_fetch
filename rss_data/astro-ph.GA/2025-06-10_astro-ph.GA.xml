      <title>JWST interferometric imaging reveals the dusty disk obscuring the supermassive black hole of the Circinus galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dusty and molecular torus is one of the most elusive structures surrounding supermassive black holes, yet its importance is unequivocal for understanding feedback and accretion mechanisms. The torus and accretion disk feed the inspiraling gas onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and launch outflows, fundamentally connecting the SMBH activity to the host galaxy. This scenario situates the torus as the interface between the AGN and its host galaxy with a flow cycle of molecular gas and dust of a few parsecs in size. Here, we utilize a novel aperture-masking interferometric mode onboard the JWST, achieving twice the previously possible resolution, and bringing out the fainter features that clearly show the torus being the critical interface for feeding material from galaxy scales into the SMBH. We also identify that $&lt;1$% of the emission arises from an arc structure composed of hot dust entrained in a molecular and ionized outflow. The rest of the emission, $12$%, is associated with dust heated by the AGN and/or radio-jet at large scales. Combined with continuum data, gas tracers, and torus models, our study shows that most of the dust mass is located in the equatorial axis in the form of a disk feeding the AGN.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic and explosive $\alpha$-element chemical abundances of Milky Way globular clusters, halo substructures, and satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar atmospheric element abundance ratios of stars retain information about their birth conditions, helping elucidate their origin and nature. In this letter, we analyse and contrast the hydrostatic and explosive $\alpha$-element abundance ratios, and the ratio of the two (the hex ratio), for a large sample of Galactic globular clusters (GCs), halo substructures, satellite galaxies, and the Milky Way high-/low-$\alpha$ discs using data from the $APOGEE$ survey. Our results show that: $i$) Milky Way GCs and halo substructures appear to have qualitatively similar hex ratios across a broad range of [Fe/H], that are higher than that of dwarf satellite galaxies of similar [Fe/H]; $ii$) for all stellar populations studied, there is a trend in the hex ratio with [Fe/H]; $iii$) there is a weak trend in the hex ratio with respect to age for Galactic GCs, but not with initial or final GC mass; $iv$) there are no differences in the hex ratio between GCs formed $in$ $situ$ versus those labelled as accreted.</description>

      <title>The impact of applying black hole-host galaxy scaling relations to large galaxy populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses have shown empirical correlations with host galaxy properties. These correlations are often the only method available to estimate SMBH masses and gather statistics for large galaxy populations across a range of redshifts, even though the scaling relations themselves are derived from a small subset of nearby galaxies. Depending on the scaling relation used, estimated SMBH masses can vary significantly. The most widely used scaling relations are the M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ relations, where M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ is galaxy bulge mass and $\sigma$ is the bulge velocity dispersion. In this paper, we determine how severely the choice of scaling relation impacts SMBH mass estimates for different subsets of a large galaxy population. For this analysis we use a sample of $\sim$ 400,000 galaxies, including 1,240 Type 1 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate SMBH masses from M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ and compare to single-epoch virial SMBH masses from broad-line H$\beta$, which are derived independently of black hole-host galaxy scaling relations. We find that SMBH masses derived from the single-epoch virial relation for H$\beta$ are better reproduced by M$_{BH}- \sigma$ than M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$. Finally, in cases where $\sigma$ and M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ cannot be measured directly, we show that it is possible to infer $\sigma$ from photometry with more accuracy than we can infer M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$.</description>

      <title>First joint absorption and T$_e$-based metallicity measured in a GRB host galaxy at $z=4.28$ using JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy with a measured absorption line and electron temperature (T$_e$) based metallicity, using the temperature sensitive [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line detected in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of the host of GRB 050505 at redshift $z=4.28$. We find that the metallicity of the cold interstellar gas, derived from the absorption lines in the GRB afterglow, of 12 + log(O/H)$\sim 7.7$ is in reasonable agreement with the temperature-based emission line metallicity in the warm gas of the GRB host galaxy, which has values of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.80$\pm$0.19 and 7.96$\pm$0.21 for two common indicators. When using strong emission line diagnostics appropriate for high-z galaxies and sensitive to ionisation parameter, we find good agreement between the strong emission line metallicity and the other two methods. Our results imply that, for the host of GRB050505, mixing between the warm and the cold ISM along the line of sight to the GRB is efficient, and that GRB afterglow absorption lines can be a reliable tracer of the metallicity of the galaxy. If confirmed with a large sample, this suggest that metallicities determined via GRB afterglow spectroscopy can be used to trace cosmic chemical evolution to the earliest cosmic epochs and in galaxies far too faint for emission line spectroscopy, even for JWST.</description>

      <title>The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>IRAS 16475-4609: A Young Compact HII Region Sculpting Its Molecular Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data. Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of 3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions. From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early evolution of compact HII regions.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer modeling for 163 MUSE Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies at $z=$3--6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer calculations from \citet{Song2020} to investigate the properties of extended Ly$\alpha$ halos around star-forming galaxies in the \textit{Hubble} Ultra Deep Field, observed by the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. Expanding on the work of \citet{Song2020}, which was limited to eight galaxies, we derived best-fit models for a significantly larger sample of 163 galaxies, which successfully reproduced both their Ly$\alpha$ spectra and surface brightness profiles (SBPs). These best-fit models suggest a broad medium distribution surrounding each galaxy, with low expanding velocities at large radii. This conclusion could not have been drawn from modeling either the spectrum or SBP alone, but only through simultaneous modeling of both. Our correlation analysis between observables and model parameters reveals that the spatial extent of Ly$\alpha$ halos is primarily determined by the extents of the medium and the source, while the spectral peak shift and full width at half maximum are governed mainly by optical depth, with the velocity structure of the medium playing a secondary yet non-negligible role. The fact that various correlations derived from the full set of models and those from the best-fit subset can differ significantly highlights the complex and interdependent nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer. All model parameters interact to shape the observed Ly$\alpha$ features in a non-trivial way.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17 HII Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164 bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450 and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Odd Radio Circles and Other Peculiars in the First Year of the EMU Survey using Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) and other unusual radio morphologies using data from the first year of the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey. ORCs are rare, enigmatic objects characterized by edge-brightened rings of radio emission, often found in association with distant galaxies. To identify these objects, we employ a hybrid methodology combining supervised object detection techniques and visual inspection of radio source candidates. This approach leads to the discovery of five new ORCs and two additional candidate ORCs, expanding the known population of these objects. In addition to ORCs, we also identify 55 Galaxies with Large-scale Ambient Radio Emission (GLAREs), which feature irregular, rectangular, or circular shapes of diffuse radio emission mostly surrounding central host galaxies. These GLAREs may represent different evolutionary stages of ORCs, and studying them could offer valuable insights into their evolutionary processes. We also highlight a subset of Starburst Radio Ring Galaxies (SRRGs), which are star-forming galaxies exhibiting edge-brightened radio rings surrounding their central star-forming regions. We emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength follow-up observations to better understand the physical properties, host galaxy characteristics, and evolutionary pathways of these radio sources.</description>

      <title>The connection between galaxy mergers, star formation and AGN activity in the HSC-SSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers are considered to enhance star formation rates (SFR), fuel supermassive black hole growth and stimulate active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, quantifying these phenomena remains a challenge, due to difficulties both in classifying mergers and in quantifying galaxy and AGN properties. We quantitatively examine the merger-SFR-AGN connection using Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) galaxies using novel methods for both galaxy classification and property measurements.} {Mergers in HSC-SSP observational images are identified through fine-tuning Zoobot, a pretrained deep representation learning model, using images and labels based on the Galaxy Cruise project. We use galaxy and AGN properties that were produced by fitting Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectra using the SED fitting code ProSpect, which fits panchromatically across the far-UV through far-infrared wavelengths and obtains galaxy and AGN properties simultaneously.} \textbf{{Little differences are seen in SFR and AGN activity between mergers and controls, with $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.009\pm 0.003$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.010\pm0.033$ dex and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.002\pm0.025$ dex. After further visual purification of the merger sample, we find $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.033\pm0.014$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.024\pm0.170$ dex, and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.019\pm0.129$ dex for pairs, and $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.057\pm0.024$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.286\pm0.270$ dex, and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.329\pm0.195$ dex for postmergers. These numbers suggest secular processes being an important driver for SF and AGN activity, and present a cautionary tale when using longer timescale tracers.</description>

      <title>The central spectra of massive star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have examined the nuclear spectra of very massive star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 0$ to understand how they differ from other galaxies with comparable masses, which are typically passive. We selected a sample of 126 nearby massive star-forming galaxies ($&lt;100~{\rm Mpc}$, $10^{11.3}~\rm{M_\odot} \leq M_{\rm stellar} \leq 10^{11.7}~\rm{M_\odot}$, $1 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}&lt; {\rm SFR} &lt;13 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}$) from the 2MRS-Bright WXSC catalogue. LEDA morphologies indicate at least 63\% of our galaxies are spirals, while visual inspection of Dark Energy Survey images reveals 75\% of our galaxies to be spirals with the remainder being lenticular. Of our sample 59 have archival nuclear spectra, which we have modelled and subsequently measured emission lines ([NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$, H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$, [OIII]$\rm{\lambda 5008}$, and H$\beta\rm{\lambda 4863}$), classifying galaxies as star-forming, LINERS, or AGNs. Using a BPT diagram we find $83 \pm 6$ \% of our galaxies, with sufficient signal-to-noise to measure all 4 emission lines, to be LINERs. Using the [NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$/H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$ emission line ratio alone we find that $79 \pm 6$ \% of the galaxies (46 galaxies) with archival spectra are LINERs, whereas just $\sim 30\%$ of the overall massive galaxy population are LINERs (Belfiore et al. 2016). Our sample can be considered a local analogue of the Ogle et al. (2016, 2019) sample of $z \sim 0.22$ massive star-forming galaxies in terms of selection criteria, and we find 64\% of their galaxies are LINERs using SDSS spectra. The high frequency of LINER emission in these massive star-forming galaxies indicates that LINER emission in massive galaxies may be linked to the presence of gas that fuels star formation.</description>

Abstract: JWST and HST observations have revealed numerous elongated, pickle-shaped galaxies at high to intermediate redshifts, with masses close to those expected for Milky Way progenitors. Here we use reduced-mass eigentensors to quantify the ellipsoidal shape evolution of thirteen Milky Way-mass galaxies simulated using FIRE-2 physics; all but one form disks at $z=0$. We find that all of our Milky Way progenitors go through phases when they are elongated. They often oscillate between spheroidal and elongated shapes in the early Universe over billion-year timescales. This is true whether we measure shapes weighted on stellar mass or luminosity, though the luminosity shapes show more extreme elongation and variance. In contrast, the stellar populations of our $z=0$ Milky Way analogs are never elongated and always symmetric about their minor axes. The youngest stars at $z=0$ reside in thin disks, intermediate-age stars reside in thick disks, and the oldest stars reside in flattened spheroids that are symmetric about their minor axes. Despite their symmetric shapes at $z=0$, the old and intermediate age stellar populations were often arranged in the shape of elongated pickles or triaxial spheroids at the time they formed, meaning that these populations changed shape significantly over time. Our results suggest that observed elongated galaxies seen in the early Universe are not stable structures, but rather reflect transitory phases of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The Compton-thick AGN Population and the $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution of Low-mass AGN in our Cosmic Backyard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN) population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples. We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an $N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the $\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast, the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as $\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates, and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt;$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.</description>

      <title>Fading in the Flow: Suppression of cold gas growth in expanding galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiwavelength observations reveal multiphase outflows that play a crucial role in redistributing gas and metals in and around galaxies. Theoretical modelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of a spherical cold ($\sim 10^4 \ \rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6\ \rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions change downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations. To address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival, morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic simulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady background wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier &amp; Clegg 1985 (CC85) analytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast with respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the wind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a plane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative background. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of cloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind tunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow. Consequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold gas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Measurement of Heavy Element Abundances of Wolf-Rayet Stars in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra} observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature, non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit, taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds, which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances, which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow onto Sgr A*, are addressed.</description>

      <title>The detection of spatially resolved protosteller outflows and episodic jets in the outer Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of spatially resolved protostellar outflows and jets in the outer Galaxy. We observed five star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy (Sh 2--283, NOMF05-16/19/23/63; galactocentric distance = 15.7--17.4 kpc) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Towards Sh 2--283, we have detected distinct outflow ($\sim$5--50 km s$^{-1}$) and jet components ($\sim$50--100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the protostar in CO(3--2) emission. The outflows and jets are well-collimated, with the jets exhibiting multiple bullet structures. The position-velocity diagram along the CO flow axis shows two characteristic structures: (a) the flow velocity which linearly increases with the position offset from the core center (Hubble-like flow), and (b) continuous velocity components of the periodical flows (spine-like structures), which may indicate the episodic mass-ejection event. The time intervals of the mass-ejection events are estimated to be 900--4000 years based on the slopes of these spine-like structures. These characteristics align with those of nearby protostellar systems, indicating that early star formation in low-metallicity environments, such as the outer Galaxy, resembles that in the inner Galaxy. In contrast to the physical similarities, the $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio in the jet bullet appears to be lower than that measured in the low-mass protostellar sources in the inner Galaxy. This may indicate the different shock chemistry or different dust composition in the outer Galaxy source, although non-LTE effects could also affect the observed low $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio. We also report the new detection of the other 4 outflow sources in the outer Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Deriving physical parameters of unresolved star clusters. VIII. Limits of aperture photometry for star cluster studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been noticed that the discrepancies in the integrated colour indices (CIs) between star clusters and models are mostly due to the projection of bright stars in the apertures. In order to reduce this problem, the method of adaptive aperture photometry has been proposed. This method has been applied to star clusters from the M 31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, and studies show that the adaptive aperture photometry performs better than the conventional approach. The aim of this study is to determine the best achievable limits on the accuracy and applicability of the aperture photometry method for studying star clusters in the local Universe. We computed a large network of artificial 3D star clusters spanning the parameter space of the M 31 clusters. We then simulated images of these clusters by projecting each onto a 2D plane from 100 directions. Star cluster images were generated in six passbands to match the PHAT survey. To investigate the limiting accuracy of aperture photometry and the limits of its applicability to star cluster studies, we measured the simulated images and performed parameter determination tests. We demonstrate that star clusters with and without post-main-sequence stars have significant photometric differences. We show that in order to obtain reliable physical parameters of star clusters, the CIs must be measured using an aperture with a radius larger than the cluster's half-light radius. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameter determination of young clusters (~10 Myr) is problematic regardless of the aperture size used. Therefore, it is advisable to determine the parameters of these clusters using colour-magnitude diagram fitting methods, when possible. We also show that the randomness of the viewing angle can lead to a CI uncertainty of up to 0.1 mag, depending on cluster parameters and aperture size.</description>

      <title>XRISM insights for interstellar Sulfur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0 sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40% +/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of &lt; 25%, which is consistent with prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Chemistry of CN Radicals on Ices: The formation of CH3CN and CH3NC and potential connection to acetamide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Among the most significant chemical functional groups of interstellar molecules are the class of nitriles, which are proposed as key prebiotic molecules due to their chemical connection to the peptide bond after hydrolysis. CN radicals, the simplest representative of this group, have been shown to exhibit strong interactions with interstellar water ices, potentially impacting their reactivity with other radicals nearby. Aims. This study explores (a) whether CN and CH3 radicals can readily react to form methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and its isomer methyl isocyanide (CH3NC); and (b) the feasibility of the reaction (CN...H2O)hemi -&gt; C(OH)=NH and its potential role in the formation of acetamide. Methods. Following a benchmark, density functional theory was employed to map the potential energy surfaces of these chemical processes, focusing on their reactivity on water and carbon monoxide ices. Results. The results show that CN reacts with CH3 radicals on water ices, forming CH3CN and CH3NC efficiently. However, these reactions are driven by diffusion of CH3 towards the reactive site and subsequently compete with back-diffusion of CH3 from that site. The formation of the radical intermediate C(OH)=NH on water ice requires quantum tunnelling and assuming that acetimidic acid forms via CH3 + C(OH)=NH -&gt; CH3C(OH)=NH, it can also only isomerize into acetamide through a sizable barrier thanks to quantum tunnelling. Both quantum tunnelling-driven reactions are highly dependent on the local structure of the water ice. Finally, radical coupling reactions on carbon monoxide ices are found to be barrierless for all cases and again, both the cyanide and the isocyanide are formed. Conclusions. This work reinforces the conclusion that CN radicals on interstellar grain surfaces are highly reactive and unlikely to persist unaltered.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Massive Distant Clusters Survey: Detection of Diffuse Radio Emission in Galaxy Clusters at $z &gt; 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse, low surface-brightness radio emission in merging galaxy clusters provides insights into cosmic structure formation, the growth of magnetic fields, and turbulence. This paper reports a search for diffuse radio emission in a pilot sample of six high-redshift ($1.01 &lt; z &lt; 1.31$) galaxy clusters from the MeerKAT Massive Distant Cluster Survey (MMDCS). These six clusters are selected as the most massive $(M_{\rm 500c} = 6.7\,- 8.5 \times 10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}})$ systems based on their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass from the full MMDCS sample of 30 ACT DR5 clusters, and were observed first to explore the high-mass, high-redshift regime. Diffuse radio emission is confidently detected in four clusters and tentatively identified in two, with $k$-corrected radio powers scaled to 1.4 GHz ranging from $(0.46 \pm 0.16)$ to $(4.51 \pm 1.68) \times 10^{24}\, \mathrm{WHz^{-1}}$ and linear sizes between 0.47 and 1.08 Mpc. Combining $Chandra$ X-ray data with MeerKAT radio data, we find that 80$\%$ of clusters with X-ray observations exhibit disturbed morphologies indicative of mergers. These $z &gt; 1$ galaxy clusters scatter around the established radio power-mass scaling relation observed at lower redshifts, supporting turbulent re-acceleration models in high-redshift mergers. However, their radio spectra are predicted to steepen ($\alpha &lt; -1.5$) due to enhanced inverse Compton losses in the cosmic microwave background, rendering them under-luminous at 1.4 GHz and placing them below the correlation. Our results demonstrate that merger-driven turbulence can sustain radio halos even at $z &gt; 1$ while highlighting MeerKAT's unique ability to probe non-thermal processes in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Radio-loud AGN morphology and host-galaxy properties in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-loud active galaxies (RLAGN) can exhibit various morphologies. The Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classifications, which are defined by the locations of peaks in surface brightness, have been applied to many catalogues of RLAGN. The FR classifications were initially found to correlate with radio luminosity. However, recent surveys have demonstrated that radio luminosity alone does not reliably predict radio morphology. We have devised a new-semi automated method involving ridgeline characterisations to compile the largest known classified catalogue of RLAGN to date with data from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2). We reassess the FR divide and its cause by examining the physical and host galaxy properties of $3590$ FRIIs and $2354$ FRIs (at $z \leq 0.8$). We find that RLAGN near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$ are more likely to show FRI over FRII morphology if they occupy more massive host galaxies. We find no correlation, when considering selection effects, between the FR break luminosity and stellar mass or host-galaxy rest-frame absolute magnitude. Overall, we find the cause of different radio morphologies in this sample to be complex. Considering sources near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$, we find evidence to support inner environment having a role in determining jet disruption. We make available a public catalogue of morphologies for our sample, which will be of use for future investigations of RLAGN and their impact on their surroundings.</description>

      <title>Observations of Carbon Radio Recombination Lines with the NenuFAR telescope. I. Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRLs) at decametre wavelengths trace the diffuse phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. Their observation allows to measure physical parameters of this phase. We observed CRRLs with the recently commissioned New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR) telescope towards two of the brightest sources at low-frequency (10-85 MHz): Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A (hereafter Cas A and Cyg A respectively), to measure the density n_e and temperature T_e of electrons in line-of-sight clouds. We used NenuFAR's beamforming mode, and we integrated several tens of hours on each source. The nominal spectral resolution was 95.4 Hz. We developed a pipeline to remove radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination and correct the baselines. We then fitted the spectral lines observed in absorption, associated to line-of-sight clouds. Cas A is the brightest source in the sky at low frequencies and represents an appropriate test bench for this new telescope. On this source, we detected 398 C\alpha lines between principal quantum numbers n=426 and n=826. C\alpha lines towards Cyg A were fainter. We stacked the signal by groups of a few tens of lines to improve the quality of our fitting process. On both sources we reached significantly higher S/N and spectral resolution than the most recent detections by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The variation of line shape with n provides constraints on the physical properties of the clouds: T_e, n_e, the temperature T_0 of the radiation field, the mean turbulent velocity v_t and the typical size of the cloud. The NenuFAR observations sample a larger space volume than LOFAR's towards the same sources due to the differences in instrumental beamsizes, and the discrepancies highlight the sensitivity of low-frequency CRRLs as probes of the diffuse ISM, paving the way towards large area surveys of CRRLs in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Evolutionary Path of Star-Forming Clumps in Hi-GAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2 {\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases, with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission, and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature of the SF process.</description>

      <title>UVIT Study of the Magellanic Clouds (U-SMAC). III. Hierarchical Star Formation in the Small Magellanic Cloud Regulated by Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an irregular dwarf galaxy exhibiting evidence of recent and ongoing star formation. We performed a spatial clustering analysis of far-ultraviolet stars in the SMC younger than 150 Myr using data from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. We identified 236 young stellar structures as surface overdensities at different significance levels. The sizes of these structures range from a few parsecs to several hundred parsecs. Their irregular morphologies are characterized by a perimeter-area dimension, derived from the projected boundaries of the young stellar structures, of Dp = 1.46 +/- 0.4. The 2D fractal dimensions obtained from, respectively, the number-size relation and the size distribution are D2 = 1.64 +/- 0.03 and D2 = 1.31 +/- 0.16. These values indicate significant lumpiness among the young stellar structures. In addition, the surface density distribution of the identified structures follows a log-normal distribution. These features are strikingly similar to those of the turbulent interstellar medium, thus supporting the scenario of hierarchical star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence.</description>

      <title>A New Spectral Class of Brown Dwarfs at the Bottom of the IMF in IC 348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an estimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon, which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\sim2$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new members ($\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by the presence of the 3.4 $\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.</description>

      <title>Investigating the physical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at z&gt;=1.5 in the GOODS-South field using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated how well the physical properties of progenitors of present-day massive spheroidal galaxies (proto-spheroids) can be constrained by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-South field, which benefits from extensive photometric and spectroscopic data, including those from the Hubble, Spitzer and Herschel. We adopted a physical model for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies, which form the bulk of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z&gt;=1.5 and confirmed its consistency with recent mid-infrared high-z galaxy luminosity functions. Using the model and the JADES survey strategy, we simulated a sample of proto-spheroids over 87.5 arcmin^2, matching the JADES/GOODS-S survey area. Photometric redshifts estimated from simulated JWST photometry showed &gt;=95% accuracy and were used in SED fitting with CIGALE. We demonstrated that JWST will provide reliable stellar mass estimates up to 0.1 dex for the majority of proto-spheroids at z&gt;=1.5 and can detect low-mass systems during cosmic noon that were inaccessible in the pre-JWST era. Focusing on the active star-forming phase of the proto-spheroid evolution, we defined a sub-sample flux limited at 250 micron (DSFG sample) and derived SFR, dust luminosity and dust mass complementing the JWST photometry with that from Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel. We also constructed a JWST-selected DSFG catalog from ASTRODEEP data using NIRCam colour criteria and demonstrated strong consistency between the observed and simulated DSFG populations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and kinematic analyses of a warm survivor of a D6 supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm ($T_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium. We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta. While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential velocity to $1950^{+810}_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6 mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an ejection speed of $1870^{+360}_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$Myr time of flight.</description>

      <title>An environmental analysis of supernova iPTF13bvn with HST and MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.</description>

      <title>Measuring monster MBHs: maybe mighty, maybe merely massive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate black hole mass (MBH) measurements in high-z galaxies are difficult yet crucial to constrain the growth of supermassive BHs, and to discriminate between competing BH seed models. Recent studies claimed the detection of massive BHs in very distant AGN, implying extreme growth conditions. However, these estimates are usually obtained by extrapolating indirect methods that are calibrated for moderately accreting, low-luminosity AGN in the local universe. To assess the reliability of the single epoch method (SE) in the distant universe, we compute the MBH for a sample of hyper-luminous distant quasars and a sample of highly accreting AGN using the X-ray scaling method. We first verify that this X-ray method yields reliable MBH values for distant highly accreting objects. Then, we carry out a systematic comparison with the SE method and find that these two indirect methods yield consistent MBH over a broad range of luminosities, intrinsic absorption, and accretion rates. The only discrepancies are associated with AGN that are substantially absorbed (underestimated by the SE method), and AGN accreting well above the Eddington limit (overestimated by the SE method). The latter result casts some doubts on the claim of overmassive BHs in highly accreting AGN in the early universe. Our study also reveals that one of the frequently used AGN catalogs consistently underestimates the MBH values by a factor of 2.5. Although this factor is of the order of the uncertainty generally associated with the SE method, we demonstrate that the use of underestimated values may result in potentially misleading conclusions. Specifically, for this AGN sample we confirm strong positive correlations for Gamma vs. lambda_Edd and for the X-ray bolometric correction vs. lambda_Edd, as well as for Gamma vs. the soft excess strength, at odds with the conclusions inferred using underestimated MBH values.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quantum polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of astrophysical objects is usually modeled under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, actual configurations may deviate from perfect spherical or isotropic properties. Consequently, cosmic objects are expected to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. This consideration also extends to hypothetical dark structures, such as dark stars and dark matter halos. Although the nature of dark matter remains unknown, axion-like particles (ALPs) are strong candidates, suggesting that dark matter halos may have originated from bosonic configurations undergoing gravitational collapse, sustained by boson-boson interactions in the condensate state. This system is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Furthermore, within the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie approach, quantum effects,encapsulated in the so-called quantum potential, may play a significant role in equilibrium astrophysical configurations. In this study, we examine a class of static anisotropic boson stars which are non-minimally coupled to gravity. By including all these factors, we derive a generalized Lane-Emden-like equation and conduct a detailed analysis of the maximum degree of anisotropy that such systems can sustain, thereby identifying physically viable equilibrium configurations. Apart from focusing on the impact of anisotropic contributions, we find that for the so-called Quantum Polytropes (when the quantum potential is the main responsible for the equilibrium condition), the anisotropic factor and the gravitational field have opposite roles compared to the classical case. This leads to a new class of hydrostatic equilibrium objects.</description>

      <title>The VMC Survey -- LIV. Anomalous Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds Period-Luminosity relations in the near-infrared bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are less studied metal-poor pulsating stars ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.5) compared to Classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars. They follow distinct Period-Luminosity (PL) and Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations and pulsate in either the fundamental (F) or first overtone (1O) mode. Our goal is to assess the precision and accuracy of AC-based distances and evaluate their potential for establishing an independent distance scale. We derive new PL and PW relations for F-mode, 1O-mode, and, for the first time, combined F+1O ACs in the Magellanic Clouds. We study their wavelength dependence and apply the relations to estimate distances to Local Group stellar systems hosting ACs, while also confirming AC classifications. Our analysis is based on near-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200 ACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom light-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes for 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations, calibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find that PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength. Using Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC relative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in Galactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph galaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based distances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and Gaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity impacts.</description>

      <title>Precise Age For The Binary HD 21278 In The Young Alpha Persei Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084 M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr (MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.</description>

      <title>The Evolution Of Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>

Abstract: Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.</description>

Abstract: In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity &amp; large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.</description>

      <title>syren-baryon: Analytic emulators for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational waves and multi-messenger Astronomy to reverse-engineer the properties of galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$ is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel. The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry, islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and NSCs out to high redshift.</description>

      <title>Splashback radius and the mass accretion rate of RASS MCMF galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements of the radial profile of mass and galaxy number density around X-ray selected ROSAT All Sky Survey-Multi-Component Matched Filter galaxy clusters using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey. We measure the projected cross-correlation signal of the RedMaGiC "high density" galaxies around an approximately volume-limited sample of 255 galaxy clusters at a median redshift of $z=0.4$ and an X-ray luminosity $L_X &gt; 10^{44} \,\text{ergs} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{h}^{-2}$. This cross-correlation signal measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.41 allows us to infer a 3D number density profile which shows a significant steepening at the edges of these galaxy clusters, namely the splashback radius of $r_{sp}$ /$h^{-1} \mathrm{M_{\odot}} = 2.19^{+0.50}_{-0.43}$. We present the dependence of the splashback radius value over a range of absolute galaxy magnitude cuts to look for any evidence of dynamical friction affecting these results. The weak lensing signal around our galaxy clusters measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32.19 allows us to infer a halo mass $\text{log} (M_{\rm 200m} / h^{-1} \text{Mpc}) = 14.68_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. Comparison of the location of the splashback radius with the spherical overdensity boundary $r_{\rm 200m}$ shows consistency with the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ predictions. We present the first inference of the average mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters using our measurements of the splashback radius.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$Galaxy Cross-Power Spectrum with the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 &lt; z &lt;0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as FRB surveys expand.</description>

      <title>The survey of planetary nebulae in Andromeda (M31) VII. Predictions of a major merger simulation model compared with chemodynamical data of the disc and inner halo substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearest giant spiral, M31, exhibits a kinematically hot stellar disc, a global star formation episode ~2-4 Gyr ago, and conspicuous substructures in its stellar halo that are suggestive of a recent accretion event. Recent chemodynamical measurements in the M31 disc and inner halo can be used as additional constraints for N-body hydrodynamical simulations that successfully reproduce the disc age-velocity dispersion relation and star formation history as well as the morphology of the inner halo substructures. We combined a simulation of a major merger (mass ratio 1:4) with a well-motivated chemical model to predict abundance distributions and gradients in the merger remnant at z=0. We computed the projected phase space and the [M/H] distributions for the substructures in the M31 inner halo, namely, the Giant Stellar Stream (GSS) and the North-East (NE) and Western (W) shelves, and compared them with recent measurements for the M31 stars in the inner halo. This major merger model predicts (i) multiple distinct components within each of the substructures; (ii) a high mean metallicity and large spread in the GSS and NE and W Shelves which explain various photometric and spectroscopic metallicity measurements; (iii) simulated phase space diagrams that qualitatively reproduce various features identified in the projected phase space of the substructures in published data from the DESI; (iv) a large distance spread in the GSS, as suggested by previous tip of the RGB measurements; and (v) phase space ridges caused by several wraps of the secondary as well as up-scattered main M31 disc stars that also have plausible counterparts in the observed phase spaces. These results provide further strong and independent arguments for a major satellite merger in M31 ~3 Gyr ago and a coherent explanation for many of the observational results that make M31 appear so different from the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>PHIBSS: Searching for Molecular Gas Outflows in Star-Forming Galaxies at $z =$ 0.5-2.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of millimeter CO observations to search and quantify signatures of molecular gas outflows. We exploit the large sample of $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6$ galaxies observed as part of the PHIBSS1/2 surveys with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer, focusing on the 154 typical massive star-forming galaxies with CO detections (mainly CO(3-2), but including also CO(2-1) and CO(6-5)) at signal-to-noise (SNR) &gt; 1.5 and available properties (stellar mass, star formation rate, size) from ancillary data. None of the individual spectra exhibit a compelling signature of CO outflow emission even at high SNR &gt; 7. To search for fainter outflow signatures, we carry out an analysis of stacked spectra, including the full sample, as well as subsets, split in terms of stellar mass, redshift, inclination, offset in star formation rate (SFR) from the main sequence, and AGN activity. None of the physically motivated subsamples show any outflow signature. We report a tentative detection in a subset statistically designed to maximize outflow signatures. We derive upper limits on molecular gas outflow rate and mass loading factors $\eta$ based on our results and find $\eta \leq$ 2.2-35.4, depending on the subsample. Much deeper CO data and observations of alternative tracers are needed to decisively constrain the importance of cold molecular gas component of outflows relative to other gas phases.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong-lensing model of MACS~J0138.0$-$2155 based on new JWST and VLT/MUSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of $M(&lt;60~ \rm kpc) = 2.89_{-0.03}^{+0.04} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Mapping $z\simeq3.5$ AGN-driven ionized outflows in the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNi) are a key ingredient in galaxy evolution and possibly shape galaxy growth through the generation of powerful outflows. Little is known regarding AGN-driven ionized outflows in moderate-luminosity AGNi (logLbol[erg/s]&lt;47) beyond cosmic noon (z&gt;3). We present the first systematic analysis of the ionized outflow properties of a sample of X-ray-selected AGNi (logLx[erg/s]&gt;44) from the COSMOS-Legacy field at z~3.5 and with logLbol[erg/s]=45.2-46.7, by using JWST NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopic observations as part of the GA-NIFS program. We spectrally isolated and spatially resolved the ionized outflows, through a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the rest-frame optical emission lines. JWST/NIRSpec IFU data also revealed a wealth of close-by companions, of both non-AGN and AGN nature, and ionized gas streams likely tracing tidal structures and large-scale ionized gas nebulae, extending up to the circumgalactic medium. Ionized outflows are detected in all COS-AGNi targets, which we compared with results from the literature up to z~3, opportunely (re-)computed. We normalized outflow energetics ($\dot{M}_{out}$, $\dot{E}_{out}$) to the outflow density in order to standardize the various assumptions that were made in the literature. Our choice is equal to assuming that each outflow has the same gas density. We find GA-NIFS AGNi to show outflows consistent with literature results, within the large scatter shown by the collected measurements, thus suggesting no strong evolution with redshift in terms of total mass outflow rate, energy budget, and outflow velocity for fixed bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find no clear redshift evolution of the ratio of mass outflow rate and kinetic power over AGN bolometric luminosity beyond z&gt;1. In general, our results indicate no significant evolution of the physics driving outflows beyond z~3.[abridged]</description>

      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to a significant hardening phase transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by gravitational-wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. We model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to scouring by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic center density of around $10^6\,M_\odot/\mathrm{pc}^3$ is favored across most of the parameter space, shedding light on environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>The NEMESIS Catalogue of Young Stellar Objects for the Orion Star Formation Complex. I. General description of data curation</title>

Abstract: The past decade has seen a rise in the use of Machine Learning methods in the study of young stellar evolution. This trend has led to a growing need for a comprehensive database of young stellar objects (YSO) that goes beyond survey-specific biases and that can be employed for training, validation, and refining the physical interpretation of machine learning outcomes. We reviewed the literature focused on the Orion Star Formation complex (OSFC) to compile a thorough catalogue of previously identified YSO candidates in the region including the curation of observables relevant to probe their youth. Starting from the NASA/ADS database, we assembled YSO candidates from more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We collated data products relevant to the study of YSOs into a dedicated catalogue, which was complemented with data from large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and in the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. We also added significant value to the catalogue by homogeneously deriving YSO infrared classification labels and through a comprehensive curation of labels concerning sources' multiplicity. Finally, we used a panchromatic approach to derive the probabilities that the sources in our catalogue were contaminant extragalactic sources or giant stars. We present the NEMESIS catalogue of YSOs for the OSFC, which includes data collated for 27879 sources covering the whole mass spectrum and the various stages of pre-Main Sequence evolution from protostars to diskless young stars. The catalogue includes a collection of panchromatic photometric data processed into spectral energy distributions, stellar parameters, infrared classes, equivalent widths of emission lines related to YSOs accretion and star-disk interaction, and absorption lines such as lithium and lines related to source's gravity, X-ray emission observables, photometric variability observables, and multiplicity labels.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Damped Ly$\alpha$ Absorber Catalog for DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Damped Ly$\alpha$ Toolkit for automated detection and characterization of Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLA) in quasar spectra. Our method uses quasar spectral templates with and without absorption from intervening DLAs to reconstruct observed quasar forest regions. The best-fitting model determines whether a DLA is present while estimating the redshift and \texttt{HI} column density. With an optimized quality cut on detection significance ($\Delta \chi_{r}^2&gt;0.03$), the technique achieves an estimated 80\% purity and 79\% completeness when evaluated on simulated spectra with S/N~$&gt;2$ that are free of broad absorption lines (BAL). We provide a catalog containing candidate DLAs from the DLA Toolkit detected in DESI DR1 quasar spectra, of which 21,719 were found in S/N~$&gt;2$ spectra with predicted $\log_{10} (N_\texttt{HI}) &gt; 20.3$ and detection significance $\Delta \chi_{r}^2 &gt;0.03$. We compare the Damped Ly$\alpha$ Toolkit to two alternative DLA finders based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Gaussian process (GP) models. We present a strategy for combining these three techniques to produce a high-fidelity DLA catalog from DESI DR2 for the Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation measurement. The combined catalog contains 41,152 candidate DLAs with $\log_{10} (N_\texttt{HI}) &gt; 20.3$ from quasar spectra with S/N~$&gt;2$. We estimate this sample to be approximately 85\% pure and 79\% complete when BAL quasars are excluded.</description>
