      <title>Some Geophysical Aspects Of The 1908 Tunguska Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a series of works, devoted to various aspects of the 1908 Tunguska event. In this paper its author would like to draw attention to some geophysical aspects of the 1908 Tunguska event. A review of some geophysical aspects and some minor analysis of the aspects is presented in this paper. Special attention is paid to global seismic events at those times. As the epicenter of the forest-fall was in the center of a paleovolcano, so some info concerning the paleovolcano is presented. An idea was put forward about possible relationship of the geophysical peculiarities with the atmospheric optical anomalies reported at those times.</description>

      <title>Joint inversion for Vp, Vp/Vs of the San Fransico Bay Area using ADTomo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new seismological tomography method based on the fast sweeping method and advanced seismic phase picking techniques to study the complex geological structures of the San Francisco Bay Area. By calculating the eikonal equation using the fast-sweeping method, this study obtains travel time information and gradient data under a given velocity structure. With an automatic differentiation algorithm to calculate gradients of the loss function and the L-BFGS algorithm to achieve optimization, the velocity model is iteratively adjusted to minimize the loss function. The P wave to S wave velocity ratio obtained through joint inversion is more reliable than the velocity ratio obtained directly by dividing the P wave and S wave velocity models. Compared to traditional inversion, the velocity ratio here does not require the same P wave and S wave travel path, thus improving the accuracy of the velocity ratio. The method was applied to the San Francisco Bay Area, a region with complex geological structures and significant seismic activities. This region, a focal point of research interest, also provides abundant seismic data for this study. We use deep learning methods to automatically pick seismic phases, acquiring abundant P wave and S wave travel time information. This project obtains the S wave velocity structure and P wave to S wave velocity ratio results for the first time. Compared to previous inversion results, the P wave velocity model here demonstrates higher resolution and better geological correspondence. High and low velocity anomalies also align well with geological maps, providing reasonable explanations in terms of lithology.</description>

      <title>Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.</description>

      <title>Efficient Upside-Down Rayleigh-Marchenko Imaging through Self-Supervised Focusing Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Upside-Down Rayleigh-Marchenko (UD-RM) method has recently emerged as a powerful tool for retrieving subsurface wavefields and images free from artifacts caused by both internal and surface-related multiples. Its ability to handle acquisition setups with large cable spacing or sparse node geometries makes it particularly suitable for ocean-bottom seismic data processing. However, the widespread application of the method is limited by the high computational cost required to estimate the focusing functions, especially when dealing with large imaging domains. To address this limitation, a self-supervised learning approach is proposed to accelerate the estimation of the focusing functions. Specifically, a U-Net network is trained on a small subset of image points from within the target area of interest, whose focusing functions are pre-computed using the conventional iterative scheme. The network is tasked to predict both the up- and down-going focusing functions from an initial estimate of the subsurface wavefields. Once trained, the network generalizes to remaining unseen imaging locations, enabling direct prediction of the focusing functions. Validation on a synthetic dataset with both dense and sparse receiver sampling using progressively fewer training points demonstrates the method's effectiveness. In both cases, the resulting images closely match those obtained from the UD-RM method with focusing functions retrieved by the conventional iterative approach at a much lower cost and significantly outperform mirror migration (when the same input dataset is used). Finally, an application to the Volve field data confirms the method's robustness in practical scenarios. The proposed approach enables seismic imaging at a fraction of the computational cost of the conventional UD-RM approach while maintaining imaging quality, underscoring its potential for large-scale seismic applications.</description>
