      <title>Coexistence of distinct nonuniform nonequilibrium steady states in Ehrenfest multiurn model on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed Ehrenfest M-urn model with interactions on a ring is considered as a paradigm model which can exhibit a variety of distinct nonequilibrium steady states. Unlike the previous three-urn model on a ring which consists of a uniform steady state and a nonuniform nonequilibrium steady state, it is found that for even M&gt;=4, an additional nonequilibrium steady state can coexist with the original ones. Detailed analysis reveals that this additional nonequilibrium steady state emerged via a pitchfork bifurcation which cannot occur if M is odd. Properties of this nonequilibrium steady state, such as stability, and steady-state flux are derived analytically for the four-urn case. The full phase diagram with the phase boundaries is also derived explicitly. The associated thermodynamic stability is also analyzed, confirming its stability. These theoretical results are also explicitly verified by direct Monte Carlo simulations for the three-urn and four-urn ring models.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The possible extension to include multiplicative noises is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical pentagon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical pentagon lattice is studied by means of the tensor network methods. The lattice consists of pentagons, where 3 or 4 of them meet at each vertex. Correlation functions on the surface of the system up to n = 10 layers are evaluated by means of the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) method, and the power low decay is observed in the high temperature region. The recursive structure of the lattice enables complemental numerical study for larger systems, by means of a variant of the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Calculated spin expectation value shows that there is a mean-field type order-disorder transition at T1 = 1.58 on the surface of the system. On the other hand, the bulk part exhibits the transition at T2 = 2.269. Consistency of these calculated results is examined.</description>

      <title>Self-organised dynamics beyond scaling of avalanches: Cyclic stress fluctuations in critical sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognising changes in collective dynamics in complex systems is essential for predicting potential events and their development. Possessing intrinsic attractors with laws associated with scale invariance, self-organised critical dynamics represent a suitable example for quantitatively studying changes in collective behaviour. We consider two prototypal models of self-organised criticality, the sandpile automata with deterministic (Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld) and probabilistic (Manna model) dynamical rules, focusing on the nature of stress fluctuations induced by driving - adding grains during the avalanche propagation, and dissipation through avalanches that hit the system boundary. Our analysis of stress evolution time series reveals robust cycles modulated by collective fluctuations with dissipative avalanches. These modulated cycles are multifractal within a broad range of time scales. Features of the associated singularity spectra capture the differences in the dynamic rules behind the self-organised critical states and their response to the increased driving rate, altering the process stochasticity and causing a loss of avalanche scaling. In the related sequences of outflow current, the first return distributions are found to follow modified laws that describe different pathways to the gradual loss of cooperative behaviour in these two models. The spontaneous appearance of cycles is another characteristic of self-organised criticality. It can also help identify the prominence of self-organisational phenomenology in an empirical time series when underlying interactions and driving modes remain hidden.</description>

      <title>Exact Work Distribution and Jarzynski's Equality of a Relativistic Particle in an Expanding Piston</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium work in a pedagogical model of relativistic ideal gas. We obtain the exact work distribution and verify the Jarzynski's equality. In the non-relativistic limit, our results recover the non-relativistic results [arXiv:cond-mat/0502434]. We also find that, unlike the non-relativistic case, the work distribution no longer has zeros and the number of collisions in this relativistic gas model is finite. In addition, based on an analysis of the experimental parameters, we conclude that it is difficult to detect the relativistic effects of the work distribution of the ideal gas in a piston system with the current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Cost of excursions until first return for random walks and L\'evy flights: an exact general formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time random walk where a cost is incurred at each jump. We obtain an exact analytical formula for the distribution of the total cost of a trajectory until the process returns to the origin for the first time. The formula is valid for arbitrary jump distribution and cost function (heavy- and light-tailed alike), provided they are symmetric and continuous. The tail behavior of the distribution is universal and independent of the details of the model. Applications are given to the motion of an active particle in one dimension and extensions to multiple cost variables are considered. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Bound for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We derive the bound for the extended nonlinearity in nonequilibrium state, characterized by the nonlinearity in equilibrium state, Renyi alpha-divergence between equilibrium and nonequilibrium distribution, temperature and work.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation inequality on short timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral relation is derived from the Fokker-Planck equation which connects the steady-state probability currents with the dynamics of relaxation on short timescales in the limit of small perturbation fields. As a consequence of this integral relation, a lower bound on the steady-state entropy production is obtained. For the particular case of an ensemble of random perturbation fields of weak spatial gradient, a simpler bound is derived from the integral relation which provides a feasible method to estimate entropy production from relaxation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion in bounded domains represents a paradigm in several settings: from billiard dynamics, to random walks in a finite lattice, with applications to relevant physical, ecological and biological problems. A remarkable universal property, involving the average of return times to the boundary, has been theoretically proposed, and experimentally verified in quite different contexts. We discuss here mechanisms that lead to violations of universality, induced by boundary effects. We suggest that our analysis should be relevant where non homogeneity appears in the stationary probability distribution in bounded domain.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Heterogeneous Interactions for Ecological Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behaviors of ecological systems is challenging given their multi-faceted complexity. To proceed, theoretical models such as Lotka-Volterra dynamics with random interactions have been investigated by the dynamical mean-field theory to provide insights into underlying principles such as how biodiversity and stability depend on the randomness in interaction strength. Yet the fully-connected structure assumed in these previous studies is not realistic as revealed by a vast amount of empirical data. We derive a generic formula for the abundance distribution under an arbitrary distribution of degree, the number of interacting neighbors, which leads to degree-dependent abundance patterns of species. Notably, in contrast to the well-mixed system, the number of surviving species can be reduced as the community becomes cooperative in heterogeneous interaction structures. Our study, therefore, demonstrates that properly taking into account heterogeneity in the interspecific interaction structure is indispensable to understanding the diversity in large ecosystems, and our general theoretical framework can apply to a much wider range of interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Probing marginal stability in the spherical $p=2$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the marginally stable nature of the low-temperature trivial spin glass phase in the spherical $p=2$ spin glass, by perturbing the system with three different kinds of non-linear interactions. In particular, we compare the effect of three additional dense four-body interactions: ferromagnetic couplings, purely disordered couplings and couplings with competing disordered and ferromagnetic interactions. Our study, characterized by the effort to present in a clear and pedagogical way the derivation of all the results, shows that the marginal stability property of the spherical spin glass depends in fact on which kind of perturbation is applied to the system: in general, a certain degree of frustration is needed also in the additional terms in order to induce a transition from a trivial to a non-trivial spin-glass phase. On the contrary, the addition of generic non-frustrated interactions does not destabilize the trivial spin-glass phase.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wanier Duality from Bilinear Phase Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Bilinear Phase Map (BPM), a concept that extends the Kramers-Wannier (KW) transformation to investigate unconventional gapped phases, their dualities, and phase transitions. Defined by a matrix of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights into relations between different quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory for colloidal suspensions under homogeneous steady-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT) is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Phase separation dynamics in a symmetric binary mixture of ultrasoft particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation plays an role in determining the self-assembly of biological and soft-matter systems. In biological systems, liquid-liquid phase separation inside a cell leads to the formation of various macromolecular aggregates. The interaction among these aggregates is soft, i.e., these can significantly overlap at a small energy cost. From the computer simulation point of view, these complex macromolecular aggregates are generally modeled by the so-called soft particles. The effective interaction between two particles is defined via the generalized exponential potential (GEM-n) with n = 4. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the phase separation dynamics of a size-symmetric binary mixture of ultrasoft particles. We find that when the mixture is quenched to a lower temperature below the critical temperature, the two components spontaneously start to separate. Domains of the two components form, and the equal-time order parameter reveals that the domains grow in a power-law manner with exponent 1/3, which is consistent with the Lifshitz-Slyozov law for conserved systems. Further, the static structure factor shows a power-law decay with exponent 4 consistent with the Porod law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electron localization in disordered quantum systems, focusing on both individual eigenstates and thermal states. We employ complex polarization as a numerical indicator to characterize the system's localization length. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of mean-field approximation in providing a quantitative analysis of such systems. Through this study, we seek to provide insight into the following aspects: the behavior of electron localization as a function of interaction, disorder, and temperature, whether thermal states and highly excited states exhibit similar properties in many-body localized systems, and the reliability of the mean-field approximation in low-interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Role of Fragility of the Glass Formers in the Yielding Transition under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the fragility of glass formers on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear via extensive computer simulations. Employing sphere assemblies interacting with a harmonic potential as our model glass former, we tune fragility by changing the system's density - higher density corresponds to large fragility. Our study reveals significant differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers. While both glass formers exhibit similar behaviour under poorly annealed initial conditions, the yielding transition shifts to larger values with increased annealing for fragile glasses while remaining relatively constant for strong glasses. We rationalize our results by introducing a new elastoplastic model, which qualitatively reproduces the simulation results and offers valuable insight into the physics of yielding transition under oscillatory shear deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulus-induced volumetric phase transition in gels may be potentially exploited for various bio-engineering and mechanical engineering applications. Since the discovery of the phenomenon in the 1970s, extensive experimental research has helped in understanding the phase transition and related critical phenomena. Yet, little insight is available on the evolving microstructure. In this article, we aim at unravelling certain geometric aspects of the micromechanics underlying discontinuous phase transition in polyacrylamide gels. Towards this, we use geometric thermodynamics and a Landau-Ginzburg type free energy functional involving a squared gradient, in conjunction with Flory-Huggins theory. We specifically exploit Ruppeiner's approach of Riemannian geometry-enriched thermodynamic fluctuation theory that has been previously employed to investigate phase transitions in van der Waals fluids and black holes. The framework equips us with a scalar curvature that relates to the microstructural interactions of a gel during phase transition and at critical points. This curvature also provides an insight into the universality class of phase transition and the nature of polymer-polymer interactions.</description>

Abstract: We show that the distribution of times for a diffusing particle to first hit an absorber is \emph{independent} of the direction of an external flow field, when we condition on the event that the particle reaches the target for flow away from the target. Thus, in one dimension, the average time for a particle to travel to an absorber a distance $\ell$ away is $\ell/|v|$, independent of the sign of $v$. This duality extends to all moments of the hitting time. In two dimensions, the distribution of first-passage times to an absorbing circle in the radial velocity field $v(r)=Q/(2\pi r)$ again exhibits duality. Our approach also gives a new perspective on how varying the radial velocity is equivalent to changing the spatial dimension, as well as the transition between transience and strong transience in diffusion.</description>

Abstract: It has long been known that weakly nonlinear field theories can have a late-time stationary state that is not the thermal state, but a wave turbulent state with a far-from-equilibrium cascade of energy. We go beyond the existence of the wave turbulent state, studying fluctuations about the wave turbulent state. Specifically, we take a classical field theory with an arbitrary quartic interaction and add dissipation and Gaussian-random forcing. Employing the path integral relation between stochastic classical field theories and quantum field theories, we give a prescription, in terms of Feynman diagrams, for computing correlation functions in this system. We explicitly compute the two-point and four-point functions of the field to next-to-leading order in the coupling. Through an appropriate choice of forcing and dissipation, these correspond to correlation functions in the wave turbulent state. In particular, we derive the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

Abstract: We derive a scheme by which to solve the Liouville equation perturbatively in the nonlinearity, which we apply to weakly nonlinear classical field theories. Our solution is a variant of the Prigogine diagrammatic method, and is based on an analogy between the Liouville equation in infinite volume and scattering in quantum mechanics, described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The motivation for our work is wave turbulence: a broad class of nonlinear classical field theories are believed to have a stationary turbulent state -- a far-from-equilibrium state, even at weak coupling. Our method provides an efficient way to derive properties of the weak wave turbulent state. A central object in these studies, which is a reduction of the Liouville equation, is the kinetic equation, which governs the occupation numbers of the modes. All properties of wave turbulence to date are based on the kinetic equation found at leading order in the weak nonlinearity. We explicitly obtain the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

Abstract: With the original Bak-Tang-Wisenefeld (BTW) sandpile we uncover the $1/\varphi$ noise in the mechanism maintaining self-organized criticality (SOC) - the question raised together with the concept of SOC. We posit that the dynamics of stress in the BTW sandpile follows quasi-cycles of graduate stress accumulation that end up with an abrupt stress-release and the drop of the system to subcritical state. In thermodynamic limit, the intra-cycle dynamics exhibits the $1/\varphi$ spectrum that extends infinitely and corresponds to the stress-release within the critical state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Open Quantum Spin Chains with Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of nonreciprocity on universality and critical phenomena in open quantum interacting many-body systems. Nonreciprocal open quantum systems often have an exotic spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). By considering an open quantum XXZ spin chain that exhibits LSE, we demonstrate the existence of a universal scaling regime that is not affected by the presence of the LSE. We resolve the critical exponents, which differ from those of free fermions, via tensor network methods and demonstrate that observables exhibit a universal scaling collapse, irrespective of the reciprocity. We find that the LSE only becomes relevant when a healing length scale $\xi_{\rm heal}$ at the system's edge (which is different to the localization length of the eigenstate of the Liouvillian) exceeds the system size, allowing edge properties to dominate the physics. We expect this result to be a generic feature of nonreciprocal models in the vicinity of a critical point. The driven-dissipative quantum criticality we observe has no classical analogue and stems from the existence of multiple dark states.</description>

Abstract: We show that dry scalar-order active field theories (AFTs) are universally hyperuniform, i.e., density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in the long-time limit regardless of the integrability or functional form of the active contributions up to third order in gradient terms. These AFTs include Active model B, Active model B+, and effective Cahn-Hilliard models. Moreover, density variances and spectral densities are virtually indistinguishable from that of passive phase-separated hyperuniform fields. Higher moments of the density fluctuations, however, reveal activity-dependent higher-order correlations that are not captured by conventional two-point measures that characterize hyperuniformity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, is observed across a wide variety of domains, from cosmology to condensed matter and biological systems. Although the standard definition of hyperuniformity only utilizes information at the largest scales, hyperuniform configurations have distinctive local characteristics. However, the influence of global hyperuniformity on local structure has remained largely unexplored; establishing this connection can help uncover long-range interaction mechanisms and detect hyperuniform traits in finite-size systems. Here, we study the topological properties of hyperuniform point clouds by characterizing their persistent homology and the statistics of local graph neighborhoods. We find that varying the structure factor results in configurations with systematically different topological properties. Moreover, these topological properties are conserved for subsets of hyperuniform point clouds, establishing a connection between finite-sized systems and idealized reference arrangements. Comparing distributions of local topological neighborhoods reveals that the hyperuniform arrangements lie along a primarily one-dimensional manifold reflecting an order-to-disorder transition via hyperuniform configurations. The results presented here complement existing characterizations of hyperuniform phases of matter, and they show how local topological features can be used to detect hyperuniformity in size-limited simulations and experiments.</description>

Abstract: A spontaneous symmetry-breaking order is conventionally described by a tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders, which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.</description>

Abstract: Generative Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNNs) have recently demonstrated exceptional results in image and language generation tasks, contributing to the growing popularity of generative models in both scientific and commercial applications. This work presents an exact mapping of the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting systems into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian's couplings and external fields, featuring widely used structures such as the residual connections and a recurrent architecture with clear physical meanings. Moreover, its architecture's explicit formulation enables the use of statistical physics techniques to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. As examples, new effective ARNN architectures are derived from two well-known mean-field systems, the Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, showing superior performance in approximating the Boltzmann distributions of the corresponding physics model compared to other commonly used architectures. The connection established between the physics of the system and the neural network architecture provides a means to derive new architectures for different interacting systems and interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity becomes anisotropic in a rotating medium. It is discovered here that for rotating thermalized quantum systems such as those created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the coeffficient of shear viscosity breaks up into five independent components. Similar phenomena were also discovered for quark-gluon plasma in the presence of the magnetic field. Like the Lorentz force at a finite magnetic field, the Coriolis force also creates anisotropic viscosity at nonzero rotation. As a first approach, for simplicity, the calculations are done in the nonrelativistic prescription, with a future proposal to extend it toward a relativistic description. Introducing the Coriolis force term in relaxation time approximated Boltzmann transport equation, we have found different effective relaxation times along the parallel, perpendicular, and Hall directions in terms of actual relaxation time and rotating time period. Comparing the present formalism with the finite magnetic field picture, we have shown the equivalence of roles between the rotating and cyclotron time periods, where the rotating time period is inverse of twice the angular velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium effects may have a profound impact on the performance of thermal devices performing thermodynamic tasks such as refrigeration or heat pumping. The possibility of enhancing the performance of thermodynamic operations by means of quantum coherence is of particular interest but requires an adequate characterization of heat and work at the quantum level. In this work, we demonstrate that the presence of even small amounts of coherence in the thermal reservoirs powering a three-terminal machine, enables the appearance of combined and hybrid modes of operation, where either different resources are combined to perform a single thermodynamic task, or more than one task is performed at the same time. We determine the performance of such coherence-enabled modes of operation obtaining their power and efficiency. In the case of hybrid regimes, the presence of coherence in the hot bath allows for an increase in power while maintaining high efficiencies. On the other hand, in combined regimes, a contrasting behavior emerges whereby coherence has a detrimental impact on power output and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transitions seems inconsistent with conventional statistical physics. This work clarifies this apparent inconsistency. We demonstrate the corresponding effective field theories and finite-temperature properties of light-matter interacting systems, and show how this zero-dimensional quantum phase transition occurs. We first focus on the Rabi model, which is a minimum model that hosts a superradiant quantum phase transition. With the path integral method, we derive the imaginary-time action of the photon degrees of freedom. We also define a dynamical critical exponent as the rescaling between the temperature and the photon frequency, and perform dimensional analysis to the effective action. The dynamical critical exponent shows that the effective theory of the Rabi model is a free scalar field, where a true second-order quantum phase transition emerges. These results are also verified by numerical simulations of imaginary-time correlation functions of the order parameter. Furthermore, we also generalize this method to the Dicke model. Our results make the zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transition compatible with conventional statistical physics, and pave the way to understand it in the perspective of effective field theories.</description>

Abstract: Multiscale modeling of complex systems is crucial for understanding their intricacies. Data-driven multiscale modeling has emerged as a promising approach to tackle challenges associated with complex systems. On the other hand, self-similarity is prevalent in complex systems, hinting that large-scale complex systems can be modeled at a reduced cost. In this paper, we introduce a multiscale neural network framework that incorporates self-similarity as prior knowledge, facilitating the modeling of self-similar dynamical systems. For deterministic dynamics, our framework can discern whether the dynamics are self-similar. For uncertain dynamics, it can compare and determine which parameter set is closer to self-similarity. The framework allows us to extract scale-invariant kernels from the dynamics for modeling at any scale. Moreover, our method can identify the power law exponents in self-similar systems. Preliminary tests on the Ising model yielded critical exponents consistent with theoretical expectations, providing valuable insights for addressing critical phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</title>

Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet theory of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Biaxial nematic order in fundamental measure theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Disordered Hyperuniformity in Melts of Linear Diblock Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) systems are recently discovered exotic states of matter, where (normalized) large-scale density fluctuations are completely suppressed as in crystals, even though the systems are isotropic and lack conventional long-range order. Despite recent success, realizing such systems using bottom-up approaches remains challenging. Here, we study the large-scale behavior of neat melts of linear diblock copolymers using large-cell self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations. We initialize SCFT simulations using point patterns that correspond to the local energy minimum of the so-called Quantizer energy, a geometric functional related to the free energy of copolymeric self-assemblies. Upon relaxation via the SCFT simulations, we obtain a new class of metastable disordered micelle mesophases that are hyperuniform. Moreover, we find that DHU micelle mesophases possess very similar free energies to the thermodynamically stable body-centered cubic sphere mesophases and are also much more favorable energetically than previously obtained liquid-like packings. Our findings shed light on the design of novel disordered hyperuniform materials using bottom-up approaches, and suggest new possibilities for technological applications, e.g., novel non-iridescent structural colors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism and anomalous transport in 1D semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the time-dependent free energy functionals of the semiclassical one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at different times).</description>

      <title>Second Wilson number from third-order perturbation theory for the symmetric single-impurity Kondo model at low temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the impurity-induced free energy and the impurity-induced zero-field susceptibility of the symmetric single-impurity Kondo model from weak-coupling perturbation theory up to third order in the Kondo coupling at low temperatures and small magnetic fields. We reproduce the analytical structure of the zero-field magnetic susceptibility as obtained from Wilson's renormalization group method. This permits us to obtain analytically the first two Wilson numbers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ions reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes achieve equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall process time, while in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potential of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This result is fundamental to allow the development of the equilibrium theory for the evaluation of near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging components within the subsystems matrices can be further determined. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass is further discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. Within the framework of the proposed model, interdiffusion equations can be derived from having the boundary condition established by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the near interface. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results.</description>

      <title>Noether invariance theory for the equilibrium force structure of soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give details and derivations for the Noether invariance theory that characterizes the spatial equilibrium structure of inhomogeneous classical many-body systems, as recently proposed and investigated for bulk systems [F. Samm\"uller $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{130}$, 268203 (2023)]. Thereby an intrinsic thermal symmetry against a local shifting transformation on phase space is exploited on the basis of the Noether theorem for invariant variations. We consider the consequences of the shifting that emerge at second order in the displacement field that parameterizes the transformation. In a natural way the standard two-body density distribution is generated. Its second spatial derivative (Hessian) is thereby balanced by two further and different two-body correlation functions, which respectively introduce thermally averaged force correlations and force gradients in a systematic and microscopically sharp way into the framework. Separate exact self and distinct sum rules hold expressing this balance. We exemplify the validity of the theory on the basis of computer simulations for the Lennard-Jones gas, liquid, and crystal, the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid, monatomic Molinero-Moore water at ambient conditions, a three-body-interacting colloidal gel former, the Yukawa and soft-sphere dipolar fluids, and for isotropic and nematic phases of Gay-Berne particles. We describe explicitly the derivation of the sum rules based on Noether's theorem and also give more elementary proofs based on partial phase space integration following Yvon's theorem.</description>

      <title>New insights into the origin of the first sharp diffraction peak in amorphous silica from an analysis of chemical and radial ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structural origin of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in amorphous silica is studied by analyzing chemical and radial ordering of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms in binary amorphous networks. The study shows that the chemical order involving Si--O and O--O pairs play a major role in the formation of the FSDP in amorphous silica. This is supplemented by small contributions arising from the relatively weak Si--Si correlations in the Fourier space. A shell-by-shell analysis of the radial correlations between Si--Si, Si--O and O--O atoms in the network reveals that the position and the intensity of the FSDP are largely determined by atomic pair correlations originating from the first two/three radial shells on a length scale of about 5--8 {\AA}, whereas the fine structure of the intensity curve in the vicinity of the FSDP is perturbatively modified by atomic correlations arising from the radial shells beyond 8 {\AA}. The study leads to a simple mathematical relationship between the position of the radial peaks ($r_k$) in the partial pair-correlation functions and the diffraction peaks ($Q_k$) that can be used to obtain approximate positions of the FSDP and the principal peak. The results are complemented by numerical calculations and an accurate semi-analytical expression for the diffraction intensity obtained from the partial pair-correlation functions of amorphous silica for a given radial shell.</description>
