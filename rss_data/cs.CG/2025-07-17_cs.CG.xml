      <title>Analyzing Singular Patterns in Discrete Planar Vector Fields via Persistent Path Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing singular patterns in vector fields is a fundamental problem in theoretical and practical domains due to the ability of such patterns to detect the intrinsic characteristics of vector fields. In this study, we propose an approach for analyzing singular patterns from discrete planar vector fields. Our method involves converting the planar discrete vector field into a specialized digraph and computing its one-dimensional persistent path homology. By analyzing the persistence diagram, we can determine the location of singularities, and the variations of singular patterns can also be analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in analyzing the singular patterns of noisy real-world vector fields and measuring the variations between different vector fields.</description>

      <title>A (Hilbert) geometric algorithm for approximating the halfspace depth of a point in a convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halfspace (or Tukey) depth is a fundamental and robust measure of centrality of data points in multivariate datasets. Computing the depth of a point with respect to the uniform distribution on an open convex body in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a natural algorithmic problem. While the coarser task of testing membership in convex bodies has been extensively studied, the refined problem of evaluating depth has received comparatively little attention in the literature.
  In this work, we present an algorithm for approximating the halfspace depth of a point in an open convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d.$ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic algorithm for this problem. As part of our approach, we design an algorithm for answering approximate membership queries for the depth-trimmed regions of $K$ (i.e., the superlevel sets of the depth function). Our data structure is inspired by recent work of Abdelkader and Mount [SOSA 2024], wherein approximate membership queries for $K$ are answered using geometric structures derived from the Hilbert metric on $K.$ A key component underlying our data structure is a novel quantitative comparison between the depth-trimmed regions and the Hilbert metric balls of $K$.
  Lastly, to highlight the computational expense of the problem, we present an algorithm for determining the exact depth of a point in an open planar convex polygon presented as the intersection of finitely many halfplanes.</description>

      <title>Towards an Optimal Bound for the Interleaving Distance on Mapper Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapper graphs are a widely used tool in topological data analysis and visualization. They can be viewed as discrete approximations of Reeb graphs, offering insight into the shape and connectivity of complex data. Given a high-dimensional point cloud $\mathbb{X}$ equipped with a function $f: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{R}$, a mapper graph provides a summary of the topological structure of $\mathbb{X}$ induced by $f$, where each node represents a local neighborhood, and edges connect nodes whose corresponding neighborhoods overlap. Our focus is the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, arising from a discretization of the version for Reeb graphs, which is NP-hard to compute. This distance quantifies the similarity between two mapper graphs by measuring the extent to which they must be ``stretched" to become comparable. Recent work introduced a loss function that provides an upper bound on the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, which evaluates how far a given assignment is from being a true interleaving. Finding the loss is computationally tractable, offering a practical way to estimate the distance.
  In this paper, we employ a categorical formulation of mapper graphs and develop the first framework for computing the associated loss function. Since the quality of the bound depends on the chosen assignment, we optimize this loss function by formulating the problem of finding the best assignment as an integer linear programming problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our optimization, we apply it to small mapper graphs where the interleaving distance is known, demonstrating that the optimized upper bound successfully matches the interleaving distance in these cases. Additionally, we conduct an experiment on the MPEG-7 dataset, computing the pairwise optimal loss on a collection of mapper graphs derived from images and leveraging the distance bound for image classification.</description>

      <title>Bicriteria Polygon Aggregation with Arbitrary Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating polygons by covering them with disjoint representative regions, thereby inducing a clustering of the polygons. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the total area and the total perimeter of the regions. This problem has applications in cartographic map generalization and urban analytics. Here, the polygons represent building footprints and the clusters may represent urban areas. Previous approaches forced the boundaries of the regions to come from a fixed subdivision of the plane, which allows the optimal solution (restricted in this way) to be found from a minimum cut in a dual graph. It is natural to ask whether the problem can still be solved efficiently if this restriction is removed, allowing output regions to be bounded by arbitrary curves. We provide a positive answer in the form of a polynomial-time algorithm. Additionally, we fully characterize the optimal solutions by showing that their boundaries are composed of input polygon edges and circular arcs of constant radius. Since some applications favor straight edges, we also study two problem variants in which the output regions must be polygons, but are not restricted to have boundaries from a fixed subdivision. In the first variant, region vertices must lie on the boundaries of the input polygons. The second variant requires them to be vertices of the input polygons. We show that both variants can be approximated up to a constant factor in polynomial time by altering an optimal solution for the unrestricted problem. Our experimental evaluation on real-world building footprints demonstrates that these approximate solutions are visually similar to the optimal unrestricted ones and achieve near-optimal objective values.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Functional Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computation of volumetric correspondences between 3D shapes is a prominent tool for medical and industrial applications. In this work, we pave the way for spectral volume mapping, extending for the first time the functional maps framework from the surface to the volumetric setting. We show that the eigenfunctions of the volumetric Laplace operator define a functional space that is suitable for high-quality signal transfer. We also experiment with various techniques that edit this functional space, porting them to volume domains. We validate our method on novel volumetric datasets and on tetrahedralizations of well established surface datasets, also showcasing practical applications involving both discrete and continuous signal mapping, for segmentation transfer, mesh connectivity transfer and solid texturing. Last but not least, we show that considering the volumetric spectrum greatly improves the accuracy for classical shape matching tasks among surfaces, consistently outperforming existing surface-only spectral methods.</description>
