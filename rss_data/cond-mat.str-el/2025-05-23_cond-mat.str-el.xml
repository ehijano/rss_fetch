      <title>Inchworm Tensor Train Hybridization Expansion Quantum Impurity Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of quantum impurity models plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics because of their wide-ranging applications, such as embedding theories and transport problems. Traditional methods often fall short of producing accurate results for multi-orbital systems with complex interactions and off-diagonal hybridizations. Recently, tensor-train-based integration and summation techniques have shown promise as effective alternatives. In this study, we use tensor train methods to tackle quantum impurity problems formulated within the imaginary-time inchworm hybridization expansion framework. We identify key challenges in the inchworm expansion itself and its interplay with tensor-train-based methods. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach by solving general quantum impurity problems. Our results suggest that tensor-train decomposition schemes offer a viable path toward accurate and efficient multi-orbital impurity solvers.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast charge-transfer dynamics in Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ from time-resolved optical reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ time-resolved optical reflectivity to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the charge-transfer gap (CTG) in a parent cuprate compound Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (CCOC). We observe a persistent photoinduced red shift of the CTG that lasts up to 1000 ps. The red shift during the slow decay after 10 ps can be well modeled by the localized picture, whereas its maximum value at ~0.9 ps involves additional contribution from the renormalization of the Hubbard U due to screening effect from delocalized electrons. Furthermore, coupling between the mid-gap absorption and a slow acoustic phonon launches coherent oscillations below the CTG, observed as a ~20 GHz modulation with a dispersion independent of the pump fluence. These results demonstrate the tunning of the CTG by light, unveil complex interplay between multiple degrees of freedom, and contribute to a deeper understanding of superconductivity and correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Pressure evolution of coplanar antiferromagnetism in heavy-fermion Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ce$_{2}$$M$Al$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ ($M=$ Co, Ir, Ni or Pd) are heavy-fermion materials and host a variety of ground states ranging from magnetism to non-Fermi liquid behavior. The Co, Ir, and Ni members of the series undergo magnetic ordering with decreasing transition temperatures. In contrast, the Pd compound does not magnetically order down to 0.4 K and shows non-Fermi liquid behavior, suggesting proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point. Among the series, Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ orders antiferromagnetically below $T_N=1.9$ K along with heavy-fermion behavior below 15 K. We report the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ and the evolution of the magnetic transition under external pressure. Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data suggests a coplanar antiferromagnetic structure with a wave vector $k = (1,1,1)$ and an ordered moment of $0.383 \pm 0.018 \&gt; \mu_B$ in the antiferromagnetic phase. Electrical resistivity and AC calorimetry measurements under hydrostatic pressure reveal a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition toward zero temperature around $p=1.1$ GPa. However, there is no evidence of non-Fermi liquid behavior associated with the suppression of magnetism by pressure, unlike the effect of transition-metal substitution.</description>

      <title>Finite temperatures and flat bands: the Hubbard model on three-dimensional Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on two three-dimensional extensions of the Lieb lattice: the perovskite Lieb lattice (PLL) and the layered Lieb lattice (LLL). Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations alongside Hartree-Fock and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) approaches, we analyze how flat-band degeneracy, connectivity, and lattice anisotropy influence the emergence of magnetic order. Our results show that both geometries support finite-temperature magnetic transitions, namely ferromagnetic (FM) on the PLL, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) on the LLL. Further, we have established that the critical temperature, $T_c$, as a function of the uniform on-site coupling, $U$, displays a maximum, which is smaller in the AFM case than in the FM one, despite the absence of flat bands in the LLL. We also provide numerical evidence to show that flat bands in the PLL rapidly generate magnetic moments, but a small interorbital coordination suppresses the increase of $T_c$ at large interaction strength $U/t$. By contrast, the LLL benefits from higher connectivity, favoring magnetic order even in the absence of flat bands. The possibilities of anisotropic interlayer hoppings and inhomogeneous on-site interactions were separateley explored. We have found that magnetism in the PLL is hardly affected by hopping anisotropy, since the main driving mechanism is the preserved flat band; for the LLL, by contrast, spectral weight is removed from $d$-sites, which increases $T_c$ more significantly. At mean-field level, we have obtained that setting $U=0$ on $p$ sites and $U=U_d\neq0$ on $d$ sites leads to a quantum critical point at some $U_d$; this behavior was not confirmed by our DQMC simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring magneto-electric coupling through lattice distortions: insights from a pantograph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials exhibit the coexistence of magnetic and electric order.
  They are at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics due to their potential applications in next-generation technologies such as data storage, sensors, and actuators.
  Despite significant progress, understanding and optimizing the coupling mechanisms between electric polarization and magnetism remain active areas of research.
  We review here a series of papers presenting a comprehensive numerical and theoretical exploration of a pantograph mechanism modeling magneto-electric coupling through lattice distortions in low dimensional multiferroic systems.
  These works introduce and elaborate a microscopic model where elastic lattice distortions mediate interactions between spin 1/2 magnetic moments and electric dipoles, uncovering novel physics and functionalities.
  The model successfully describes ubiquitous phenomena in type II improper multiferroics, particularly when dominant Ising spin components are
  introduced through XXZ-type rotational symmetry breaking spin interactions.
  We also study more realistic extensions relevant for materials with higher spin magnetic ions and to materials where magnetic couplings draw higher dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum melting of generalized electron crystal in twisted bilayer MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Orbital Dynamics in Strongly Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom gives rise to a variety of emergent phases in correlated 4d and 5d transition-metal systems. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly modifies Jahn-Teller (JT) physics, often suppressing static distortions or promoting dynamic fluctuations, thereby reducing or even quenching orbital polarization. While intersite hybridization is a fundamental aspect of crystalline solids, its role in shaping the dynamics of spin-orbital entangled states has received comparatively little attention. Remarkably, our analysis shows that electronic hopping can locally restore orbital polarization when the ground state is perturbed, potentially leaving measurable fingerprints in the spectra of spin-orbital excitations. Using a Matsubara lattice formalism, we study how local orbital perturbations propagate through correlated, spin-orbit-entangled systems. When intersite hopping is included, such perturbations induce shortrange orbital polarization with a characteristic orthogonal response at nearest-neighbor sites. These hopping-mediated reconstructions may contribute to low-energy spectroscopic signals, potentially overlapping with other excitations, and underscore the importance of including orbital dynamics in the interpretation of spectral data. Our results provide guidance for identifying such signatures and offer a framework for understanding dynamical responses in spin-orbit-entangled materials.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and a novel quantity assessing their interplay - called anti-flatness, after a quantum quench of a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entropy and entanglement complexity in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03093v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <title>Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</description>

      <title>Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pure nematic transition inside the superconducting dome of iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematicity and magnetism are prevalent orders in high transition temperature (Tc) superconductors, coexisting in the parent compound of most material families. Quantum fluctuations of nematicity or spin orders are both plausible candidates for mediating unconventional Cooper pairing. Identifying the sole effect of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP) on the emergence of superconducting dome without interference of spin fluctuations is therefore highly desirable. The iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe exhibits pure nematicity without any magnetic ordering. A nematic quantum phase transition can be induced by Te substitution but experimental study of such transition is so far limited to its normal state. By performing local susceptometry on composition-spread FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films ($0 &lt; x &lt; 1$) using scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (sSQUID) microscopy, we investigate the superfluid density ($\rho_s$) across the pure nematic transition in extremely fine steps of ${\Delta}x$ = 0.0008. The temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ changes from the form of anisotropic pairing on the nematic side to an isotropic one across the critical doping $x_c$. The power-law dependence of gap anisotropy on $|x - x_c|$ provides evidence for nematic quantum criticality under the superconducting dome. The low-temperature $\rho_s$ scales linearly with Tc in the nematic phase $x &lt; x_c$, whereas the gap amplitude, maximized at $x_c$, determines the Tc for $x&gt;x_c$. Our results establish a pure nematic QCP in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, separating two superconducting orders with distinct pairing boosted by nematic quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Twisted Partition Functions as Order Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effect of spark plasma sintering on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We optimize the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide (Sm1111: SmFeAsO0.80F0.20) by using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique under various synthesis conditions, including heating temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 {\deg}C for durations of 5 to 30 minutes at the applied pressure of 45 MPa. All prepared bulks are characterized by structural and microstructural analysis as well as transport and magnetic measurements to conclude our findings. SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 bulks are also prepared using the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) and the high gas pressure and high temperature (HP-HTS) methods at 500 MPa, which exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of ~54 K. Interestingly, the SPS process of SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 increases the sample densities up to 97-98% and confirms the optimized synthesis conditions of 900{\deg}C for 5-10 min; however, the increased sintering temperature or duration reduces Tc due to the possible evaporation of lighter elements, particularly fluorine. Furthermore, the SPS technique is unable to reduce the observed impurity phases for the Sm1111, which is similar to the CSP and HP-HTS processes. A slight increment in the Jc by the SPS process is observed due to the enhancement of sample density. A comparative analysis of Sm1111 superconductors prepared by SPS is performed with CSP and HP-HTS processes, suggesting that an increased sample density is ineffective on the superconducting properties in the presence of the impurity phases. This finding can be beneficial for the fundamental and applied research of iron-based superconductor (FBS).</description>

      <title>Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry may enable the development of quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to correlated topological states. One powerful probe of quantum geometry is the nonlinear Hall response which detects Berry curvature dipole in systems with time-reversal invariance and broken inversion symmetry. With broken time-reversal symmetry, this response is also associated with quantum metric dipole. Here we investigate nonlinear thermal and thermoelectric responses, which provide a wealth of new information about quantum geometry. In particular, we uncover a web of connections between these quantities that parallel the standard Wiedemann-Franz and Mott relations. Implications for the studies of a variety of topological systems, including Weyl-Kondo semimetals and Bernal bilayer graphene, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases, Criticality, and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dark Metastable Conduction Channels near a Metal-Insulator Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.</description>

Abstract: The Hubbard model, a cornerstone in the field of condensed matter physics, serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper presents a novel perspective on the model, uncovering its inherent inverted duality which has profound implications for our comprehension of this complex system. Taking advantage of this special mathematical property, we have formulated an equation that the electron Green's function must satisfy. Our findings pave the way for further exploration and potentially new insights into the dynamics of electron correlations and phase transitions in the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsically multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using previously calculated minimal tight-binding models, and demonstrated analytically on a three-band generalization of the Rice-Mele chain to elucidate the different contributions. We close with comments on further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the optical band gap through an effective Thirring interaction for massive Dirac-like electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze mass renormalization in massive Dirac-like systems in (2+1) dimensions arising from electron-phonon interactions at finite temperatures, employing the large-$N$ expansion. Our model combines the low-energy description of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and electron-phonon interactions in two-dimensional materials. Consequently, the system is modeled as a massive Dirac-like field coupled to a two-component vector field $\mathcal{A}_i$, representing the phonon modes. This framework allows us to compute the one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature, from which we derive the renormalized band gap, $m^R$. The effective model is subsequently applied to describe the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. A good agreement is observed with experimental data for reasonable values of the ultraviolet cutoff, $\Lambda \approx 1$ eV. Our main findings indicate that $m^R$ remains nearly constant at low temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures it decreases linearly with the temperature $T$. Specifically, we find that $m^R$ reduces by approximately $\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV as the temperature increases from $\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, consistent with recent experimental observations. Furthermore, we estimate the temperature range at which the transition to the linear regime occurs, obtaining typical values within $\approx [110,150]$ K for the four materials under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in isotropic noncollinear antiferromagnets produce long-range spin textures. By developing a "magnetic elasticity theory", we demonstrate that a vacancy-induced readjustment in the spin configuration decays algebraically with distance. The power law exponent depends on the multipole moment of a local spin deformation, which in turn is determined by the lattice symmetry and an equilibrium spin configuration in the absence of defects. The role of these two factors is highlighted for the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice. A vacancy in this model generates spin deformations that decay as 1/r^2 for the q=0 ground state and as a 1/r for the sqrt{3} x sqrt{3} magnetic structure. The analytic conclusions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. We also compute the fractional magnetic moments associated with vacancies and other lattice defects. Our results shed light on relative fragility of different magnetic structures with respect to spin glass formation at higher doping levels.</description>

Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a three-dimensional (3D) tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical model) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, using layer susceptibility, we obtain the boundary operator expansion for the transverse and longitudinal modes within the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D in the context of boundary criticality.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the electronic states by quantum charge fluctuations in electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Anomaly Indicators of (2+1)-D Fermionic Topological Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical proposal for the anomaly indicators of symmetries of (2+1)-d fermionic topological orders, and work out the consequences of our proposal in several nontrivial examples. Our proposal is an invariant of a super modular tensor category with a fermionic group action, which gives a (3+1)-d topological field theory (TFT) that we conjecture to be invertible; the anomaly indicators are partition functions of this TFT on $4$-manifolds generating the corresponding twisted spin bordism group. Our construction relies on a bosonization construction due to Gaiotto-Kapustin and Tata-Kobayashi-Bulmash-Barkeshli, together with a ``bosonization conjecture'' which we explain in detail. In the second half of the paper, we discuss several examples of our invariants relevant to condensed-matter physics. The most important example we consider is $\mathbb{Z}/4^T\times \mathbb{Z}/2^f$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^FC$, which many fermionic topological orders enjoy, including the $\mathrm{U}(1)_5$ spin Chern-Simons theory. Using newly developed tools involving the Smith long exact sequence, we calculate the cobordism group that classifies its anomaly, present the generating manifold, and calculate the partition function on the generating manifold which serves as our anomaly indicator. Our approach allows us to reproduce anomaly indicators known in the literature with simpler proofs, including $\mathbb{Z}/4^{Tf}$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^F$, and other symmetry groups in the 10-fold way involving Lie group symmetries.</description>

Abstract: A novel result in $\mathbb Z_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven, and applied to the topological classification of classically frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This result generalizes a lemma that had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. The methods used in the classification of topological insulators and superconductors are here generalized and their generalizations applied to systems that are not quantum mechanical. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{BDI}$, and $\mathrm{CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb Z_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of classically frustrated spin models and is compared to that of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

      <title>Entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlators, and pole skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, for an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with arbitrary dynamical critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. In the classical approach, we comment on potential limitations while choosing the turning point of the null geodesic in our gravity background. All chaotic properties emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. Finally, we remark on a possible classical/quantum correspondence from the analysis of classical eikonal phase shift and Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Interacting Twisted Bilayer Graphene with Systematic Modeling of Structural Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has drawn significant interest due to recent experiments which show that TBG can exhibit strongly correlated behavior such as the superconducting and correlated insulator phases. Much of the theoretical work on TBG has been based on analysis of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model which includes a phenomenological parameter to account for lattice relaxation. In this work, we use a newly developed continuum model which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. In particular, we model structural relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. We compare the impact of the two relaxation models on the corresponding many-body model by defining an interacting model projected to the flat bands. We perform tests at charge neutrality at both the Hartree-Fock and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) level of theory and find the systematic relaxation model gives quantitative differences from the simplified relaxation model.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>
