      <title>Importance of gravitational effects on the performances of a fully passive oscillating-foil turbine deployed horizontally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a numerical study evaluating the impact of gravity on the performance of a fully passive oscillating-foil turbine operating in a horizontal configuration, that is, where the gravity acts along the heave direction. The study examines two sets of parameters corresponding to turbines driven by different aeroelastic instabilities. For turbines experiencing stall-flutter instability, the influence of gravity on performance metrics is minimal when inertial forces dominate or are comparable to gravitational forces. At high Froude numbers, buoyancy and weight are negligible, but their impact increases at lower Froude numbers, leading to reduced performance. Conversely, turbines operating through coupled-flutter instability seem unsuitable for horizontal configurations since they require high foil moment of inertia and mass, which amplifies the effects of buoyancy and weight, thereby diminishing performance at any Froude number.</description>

      <title>Sublimation and deposition at a solid sphere in the presence of a non-condensable gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sublimation/deposition process at a solid sphere of argon into its vapor in the presence of helium as a background gas is modeled applying the linearized Boltzmann equation, in which the McCormack model is employed for the collisional term. The Onsager coefficients determining the mass and energy flow rates at the interface are calculated over a wide range of rarefaction parameter and for some values of molar fraction of the background gas in the mixture. Moreover, two values for the temperature of the mixture are considered on the basis of the sublimation curves of argon and krypton. To assess the influence of the interatomic interaction potential on the numerical results, the calculations are carried out for both the hard-spheres and \textit{ab-initio} potentials. The kinetic coefficients are presented as well as the flow fields around the sphere. The effect of a small temperature difference between the spherical surface and the gas mixture is analyzed.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Study on the Pulsation of Burner-Stabilized CH4-O2 Flames Moderated by CO2 Addition -- Frequencies, Modes and Regime Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated the pulsating instability of burner-stabilized premixed CH4-O2 flames at various levels of CO2 dilution. Experiments were conducted using a water-cooled porous-plug burner of 18 mm diameter over a wide range of mixture compositions and flow rates, during which time-resolved measurements of flame chemiluminescence and gas temperature were obtained. The primary oscillation frequencies of the pulsating flames were determined using fast Fourier transform and harmonic power analysis. Phase-locked analysis of the chemiluminescence images revealed an interesting mode-transition phenomenon of the flame oscillations. Under fuel-rich conditions with relatively low heat release rates and low flow rates, the flames exhibited quasi-periodic single-mode oscillations. These oscillations were modulated by low-frequency flame flickering instabilities at elevated flow rates, which created sidebands around the primary oscillation frequency. At higher heat release rates, the flickering instability further triggered mode splitting, eventually leading to multi-mode oscillations. Regime diagrams of the flame oscillation modes, as well as the stability boundaries, were obtained under various fuel flow rates. These findings can be useful for both fundamental research on flame dynamics and practical applications of CO$_2$-moderated oxy-combustion.</description>

      <title>Mesoscience-based structural theory for heterogeneous gas-solid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of the spatiotemporal dynamics of heterogeneous gas-solid flows is critical for the design, scale-up and optimization of gas-solid reactors. In this article, by using the core concept of mesoscience (the compromise in competition between dominant mechanisms), a mathematically rigorous procedure is proposed to develop a mesoscience-based structural theory for the dynamics of heterogeneous gas-solid flows via describing the physical states corresponding to the realization of dominant mechanisms as the interpenetrating continua, finding the microscale governing equations of gas-solid flow, defining a dominant mechanism indicator function, and finally, performing ensemble averaging to obtain the macroscopic governing equations. It is shown that the theory can be mathematically formulated as partial differential equations (PDE) constrained dynamic optimization, possible closures for the constitutive relationships are then discussed, and numerical validations using a simplified theory are also performed. Present study (i) offers an alternative method to the popular two-fluid model for simulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of heterogeneous gas-solid flows, with the distinct advantage that the constitutive relationships can be developed using the models and correlations that are obtained from homogeneous systems, of course an extra model for the interphase mass transfer rate between dilute phase and dense phase is needed, and the effective numerical solution of PDE-constrained dynamic optimization needs to be explored; and (ii) provides a feasible procedure to formulate concrete mathematical equations from the core concept of mesoscience.</description>

      <title>Disk impact on a boiling liquid: Dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon the impact of a flat disk on a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid that is in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, a thin vapor layer is entrapped under the disk. Due to the tendency of vapor to undergo phase change under pressure variation upon impact, the dynamics of this entrapped vapor pocket are different from those of a non-condensable air pocket. In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket, more specifically its time evolution and its subsequent influence on the hydrodynamic loads at different equilibrium ambient temperatures and impact velocities. We find that the retraction of the vapor pocket at high ambient temperature and small impact velocity is slow, occurring from the disk edge, and driven by the dynamic pressure $\rho_{\text{L}}U_0^2$. In contrast, at lower ambient temperatures and large impact velocities, after a short initial stage, the vapor pocket will collapse rapidly due to condensation. This scenario is confirmed by conducting experiments where, by heating the disk, the vapor pocket collapse is observed to slow down. We attribute this to the vaporization of liquid near the three-phase contact line region that frustrates the condensation process and reduces the impact pressure on the disk. The violent collapse of the vapor pocket may impart additional instantaneous momentum, but the overall pressure and force impulses are still found to be closely associated with the liquid added mass. Finally, we found that at a high tilt angle of the disk, the three-phase contact line movement over the disk surface may hinder the proper entrapment and compression of the vapor pocket, which results in a lower central impact pressure as rapid condensation at the central disk region does not occur.</description>

      <title>Impacts of flow velocity and microbubbles on water flushing in a horizontal pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water flushing to remove particle sediment is essential for safe and continuous transport of many industrial slurries through pipelines. An efficient flushing strategy may reduce water consumption and the cost associated with water usage, and help water conservation for sustainability. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with the kinetic theory of granular flow for the flushing process is presented. The CFD models were validated against field data collected from a coal slurry pipeline of 128 $km$ in length, 0.575~$m$ in diameter, achieving an average error of less than 15\% for outlet solid concentration over time. A parametric study evaluated the effects of water velocity (1.88-5.88~$m/s$), bubble size (50~$\mu m$, 150~$\mu m$, and 1000~$\mu m$) and bubble volume fraction (0.05-0.2) on flushing performance including pipeline cleanness, cleanness efficiency, and water consumption. The obtained outcomes indicate that higher water velocity is preferred and an increase in water velocity from $1.88~m/s$ to $5.88~m/s$ reduces the water consumption by $28\%$. Large bubbles may hinder the flushing process and increase the water consumption by $23\%$. Remarkably, small bubbles facilitates the flushing process and lead to $35\%$ reduction in water consumption. These effects are attributed to the turbulent characteristics in the pipelines in presence of microbubbles.</description>

      <title>Clapping propulsion and thin vortex rings: a computational study of vortex dynamics, energy equivalence, and core potential energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study on clapping propulsion using a body consisting of two rigid plates hinged at one end, with a 60-degree interplate cavity. The closing of the cavity generates a thrust-producing jet. Our previous experimental study (Mahulkar and Arakeri, PRF, 2024) compared the flow fields of the clapping body in two cases: free-moving (dynamic) and forward-constrained (stationary). The experiments revealed significant differences in body motion and flow structures. This numerical study further investigates these differences using plate motion data from the experiments. Our computations show that, in dynamic cases, interplate cavity pressure is lower than in stationary cases. A basic unsteady Bernoulli analysis explains that forward acceleration reduces interplate pressure. Furthermore, stationary cases exhibit distinct vortex dynamics, with starting vortex tubes forming at the plate edges and reconnecting with stopping vortex tubes to form triangular vortex loops in the rear wake, along with two sideways-oriented ringlets. In dynamic cases, the starting vortex tubes slide backward and reconnect with bound-vorticity threads shed from the outer surface of the plates, forming elliptical loops that reconnect circumferentially. Referring to Sullivan et al. (JFM, 2008), we quantify the energy deficit in isolated axisymmetric vortex rings using separate simulations and propose a model for the potential energy in the vortex core at the formation time. Using this model, we show that the total wake energy (kinetic + potential) equals the initial slug energy for the vortex ring, and in clapping, it equals the work done on the fluid by the pressure torque on the plates.</description>

      <title>Plane-layer Rayleigh-B\'enard convection up to $Ra=10^{11}$: Near-wall fluctuations and role of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study temperature and velocity fluctuations in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection through direct numerical simulations in a three-dimensional plane layer of height $H$ with horizontal periodic boundary conditions and aspect ratio $4H\times 4H\times H$. The analysis is performed for Rayleigh numbers $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^{11}$ and Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$. First, the study systematically summarizes the height-dependent statistics of velocity and temperature fluctuations and reports corresponding scalings with the Rayleigh number. Secondly, we include an analysis on the role of coherent and incoherent flow regions near the wall for the global heat transfer. Thirdly, we investigate the dependence of turbulent heat and momentum transfer on additional finite-amplitude shear flow modes in the initial condition at time $t=0$, which either decay unforced with respect to time in a long transient or remain existent when a steady volume forcing in the momentum balance of the Boussinesq model is added. In the latter case, logarithmic near-wall layers for mean velocity and temperature are formed. In all cases, no impact on the global turbulent heat and momentum transfer within the error bars is detected, even though the shear mode amplitude is of the order of the characteristic free-fall velocity.</description>

      <title>Preferential orientation of small floaters drifting in water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elongated floaters drifting in propagating water waves slowly rotate towards a preferential orientation with respect to the direction of incidence. In this article, we study this phenomenon in the small-floater limit $k L_x &lt; 1 $, with $k$ the wavenumber and $L_x$ the floater length. Experiments show that short and heavy floaters tend to align longitudinally, along the direction of wave propagation, whereas longer and lighter floaters align transversely, parallel to the wave crests and troughs. We show that this preferential orientation can be modeled using an inviscid Froude-Krylov model, ignoring diffraction effects. Asymptotic theory, in the double limit of small wave slope and small floater, suggests that preferential orientation is essentially controlled by the non-dimensional number $F = k L_x^2 / \overline{h}$, with $\overline{h}$ the equilibrium submersion depth. Theory predicts the longitudinal-transverse transition {for homogeneous parallelepipeds} at the critical value $F_c = 60$, in fair agreement with the experiments that locate $F_c = 50 \pm 15$. Using a simplified model for a thin floater, we elucidate the physical mechanisms that control the preferential orientation. The longitudinal equilibrium for $F&lt;F_c$ originates from a slight asymmetry between the buoyancy torque induced by the wave crests, that favors the longitudinal orientation, and that induced by the wave troughs, that favors the transverse orientation. The transverse equilibrium for $F&gt;F_c$ arises from the variation of the submersion depth along the long axis of the floaters, which significantly increases the torque in the trough positions, when the tips are more submersed.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</description>
