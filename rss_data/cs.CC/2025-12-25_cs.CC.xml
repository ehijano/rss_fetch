      <title>Shifted Partial Derivative Polynomial Rank and Codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shifted partial derivative (SPD) methods are a central algebraic tool for circuit lower bounds, measuring the dimension of spaces of shifted derivatives of a polynomial. We develop the Shifted Partial Derivative Polynomial (SPDP) framework, packaging SPD into an explicit coefficient-matrix formalism. This turns shifted-derivative spans into concrete linear-algebraic objects and yields two dual measures: SPDP rank and SPDP codimension.
  We define the SPDP generating family, its span, and the SPDP matrix M_{k,l}(p) inside a fixed ambient coefficient space determined by the (k,l) regime, so rank is canonical and codimension is a deficit from ambient fullness. We prove structural properties needed for reuse: monotonicity in the shift/derivative parameters (with careful scoping for |S|=k versus |S|&lt;=k conventions), invariance under admissible variable symmetries and basis changes, and robustness across standard Boolean/multilinear embeddings. We then give generic width-to-rank upper-bound templates for local circuit models via profile counting, separating the model-agnostic SPDP toolkit from additional compiled refinements used elsewhere. We illustrate the codimension viewpoint on representative examples.</description>

      <title>Stochastic well-structured transition systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Kolmogorov Complexity of Binary Words with Empirical Entropy Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary word reflects both algorithmic structure and the empirical distribution of symbols appearing in the word. Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin L\"of random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressibility of Truth With Application to Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of Circuit Complexity and the nature of efficient computation from a fresh perspective. We present a framework for understanding Circuit Complexity through the lens of Information Theory with analogies to results in Kolmogorov Complexity, viewing circuits as descriptions of truth tables, encoded in logical gates and wires, rather than purely computational devices. From this framework, we re-prove some existing Circuit Complexity bounds, explain what the optimal circuits for most boolean functions look like structurally, give an explicit boolean function family that requires exponential circuits, and explain the aforementioned results in a unifying intuition that re-frames time entirely.</description>
