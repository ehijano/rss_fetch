Abstract: While research on adolescent smoking is extensive, little attention has been given to smoking behaviors among rural middle-aged and older adults. This study examines the role of personal networks and sociodemographic factors in predicting smoking status in a rural Romanian community. Using a link-tracing sampling method, we gathered data from 76 participants out of 83 in Leresti, Arges County. Face-to-face interviews collected sociodemographic data and network information, including smoking status and relational dynamics. We applied multilevel logistic regression models to predict smoking behaviors (current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers) based on individual characteristics and network influences. Results indicate that social networks significantly influence smoking behaviors. For current smokers, having a smoking family member greatly increased the odds of smoking (OR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.62, 3.91, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, non-smoking family members increased the likelihood of being a non-smoker (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.61, p &lt; 0.05). Women were less likely to smoke, highlighting sex differences in behavior. These findings emphasize the critical role of social networks in shaping smoking habits, advocating for targeted interventions in rural areas.</description>
