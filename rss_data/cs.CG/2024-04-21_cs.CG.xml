      <title>Optimizing Visibility-based Search in Polygonal Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05420v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a geometric domain $P$, visibility-based search problems seek routes for one or more mobile agents ("watchmen") to move within $P$ in order to be able to see a portion (or all) of $P$, while optimizing objectives, such as the length(s) of the route(s), the size (e.g., area or volume) of the portion seen, the probability of detecting a target distributed within $P$ according to a prior distribution, etc. The classic watchman route problem seeks a shortest route for an observer, with omnidirectional vision, to see all of $P$. In this paper we study bicriteria optimization problems for a single mobile agent within a polygonal domain $P$ in the plane, with the criteria of route length and area seen. Specifically, we address the problem of computing a minimum length route that sees at least a specified area of $P$ (minimum length, for a given area quota). We also study the problem of computing a length-constrained route that sees as much area as possible. We provide hardness results and approximation algorithms. In particular, for a simple polygon $P$ we provide the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem of computing a shortest route seeing an area quota, as well as a (slightly more efficient) polynomial dual approximation. We also consider polygonal domains $P$ (with holes) and the special case of a planar domain consisting of a union of lines. Our results yield the first approximation algorithms for computing a time-optimal search route in $P$ to guarantee some specified probability of detection of a static target within $P$, randomly distributed in $P$ according to a given prior distribution.</description>

      <title>Homotopy-Aware Multi-Agent Path Planning in Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient framework using the Dynnikov coordinates for homotopy-aware multi-agent path planning in the plane. We developed a method to generate homotopically distinct solutions of multi-agent path planning problem in the plane by combining our framework with revised prioritized planning and proved its completeness in the grid world under specific assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrated the scalability of our method for the number of agents. We also confirmed the usefulness of homotopy-awareness by showing experimentally that generation of homotopically distinct solutions by our method contributes to planning low-cost trajectories for a swarm of agents.</description>
