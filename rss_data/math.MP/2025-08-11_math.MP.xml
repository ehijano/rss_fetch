      <title>Long-term behavior of the master equation on countable system space and approximation method of the (stationary) solutions via finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Master equation - also called the differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation - is a linear differential equation, which describes the probability evolution in a discrete system. While this is well understood, if the underlying state space is finite, the mathematics required for the treatment of infinite dimensional systems is way more complicated and advanced.
  In this paper we provide sufficient criteria for the rates, which guarantee that the infinite dimensional master equation is both well defined and that it can be approximated by finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we lay out the required assumptions for the time limit for an infinite dimensional system to exist, and when it can be interchanged with the limit of a large system. We give sufficient criteria, when these two limits commute and demonstrate on various examples, when they do not.</description>

      <title>On the spectral theory in the Fock space with polynomial eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of the eigenvalue problem in the Fock space with polynomial eigenfunctions is introduced. This problem is classified by using the finite-dimensional representations of the $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-algebra in Fock space. In the complex representation of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra, proposed by Turbiner-Vasilevski (2021) in Ref.7, this construction is reduced to the linear differential operators in $(\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}}\,,\,\frac{\partial}{\partial z})$ acting on the space of poly-analytic functions in $(z,\overline{z})$. The number operator, equivalently, the Euler-Cartan operator appears as fundamental, it is studied in detail. The notion of (quasi)-exactly solvable operators is introduced. The particular examples of the Hermite and Laguerre operators in Fock space are proposed as well as the Heun, Lame and sextic QES polynomial operators.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dispersive waves in soft elastic laminates under finite magneto-deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered media can be used as acoustic filters, allowing only waves of certain frequencies to propagate. In soft magneto-active laminates, the shear wave band gaps (i.e., the frequency intervals for which shear waves cannot propagate) can be adjusted after fabrication by exploiting the magneto-elastic coupling. In the present study, the control of shear wave propagation in magneto-active stratified media is revisited by means of homogenisation theory, and extended to nonlinear waves of moderate amplitude. Building upon earlier works, the layers are modelled by means of a revised hard-magnetic material theory for which the total Cauchy stress is symmetric, and the incompressible elastic response is of generalised neo-Hookean type (encompassing Yeoh, Fung-Demiray, and Gent materials). Using asymptotic homogenisation, a nonlinear dispersive wave equation with cubic nonlinearity is derived, under certain simplifying assumptions. In passing, an effective strain energy function describing such laminates is obtained. The combined effects of nonlinearity and wave dispersion contribute to the formation of solitary waves, which are analysed using the homogenised wave equation and a modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) approximation of the latter. The mKdV equation is compared to direct numerical simulations of the impact problem, and various consequences of these results are explored. In particular, we show that an upper bound for the speed of solitary waves can be adjusted by varying the applied magnetic field, or by modifying the properties of the microstructure.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent modelling and simulation of the moving contact line problem in non-isothermal compressible two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the dynamic van der Waals theory, we propose a thermodynamically consistent model for non-isothermal compressible two-phase flows with contact line motion. In this model, fluid temperature is treated as a primary variable, characterized by the proposed temperature equation instead of being obtained from intermediate variables such as total energy density, internal energy density and entropy density. The hydrodynamic boundary conditions, which represent a generalization of the generalized Navier slip boundary condition in non-isothermal flows, are imposed on the proposed model. We then develop the dimensionless form of the model and prove that it rigorously satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Two numerical schemes based on the dimensionless system are constructed: one is fully coupled and thermodynamically consistent, namely strictly satisfying the temporally discrete first and second laws of thermodynamics; the other, designed by extending the multiple scalar auxiliary variable approach to entropy production, is decoupled, linear, and unconditionally entropy-stable. Several numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of equilibrium states for fiber-bunched matrix cocycles and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the thermodynamic formalism of H\"older continuous fiber-bunched matrix cocycles, Anosov diffeomorphisms, and hyperbolic repellers. Specifically, we prove that $1$-typical fiber-bunched cocycles $\mathcal{A}$ over topologically mixing subshifts of finite type admit a unique Gibbs equilibrium state $\mu_t$ associated with the non-additive family of potentials $\{t \log \|\mathcal{A}^n\|\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, for a range of parameters $t \in (-t_*, +\infty)$, where $t_* &gt; 0$. Furthermore, these equilibrium states are $\psi$-mixing, therefore weak Bernoulli. In addition, these results allow us to derive consequences for the thermodynamic formalism of open sets of hyperbolic repellers and Anosov diffeomorphisms. In particular, it provides a positive answer to a conjecture posed by Gatzouras and Peres for $C^1$-open sets of $\alpha$-fiber-bunched hyperbolic repellers.</description>

      <title>A free fermions in disguise model with claws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several spin chain models have been discovered that admit solutions in terms of "free fermions in disguise." A graph-theoretical treatment of such models was also established, giving sufficient conditions for free fermionic solvability. These conditions involve a particular property of the so-called frustration graph of the Hamiltonian, namely that it must be claw-free. Additionally, one set of sufficient conditions also requires the absence of so-called even holes. In this paper, we present a model with disguised free fermions where the frustration graph contains both claws and even holes. Special relations between coupling constants ensure that the free fermionic property still holds. The transfer matrix of this model can be factorized in a special case, thereby proving the conjectured free fermionic nature of a special quantum circuit published recently by two of the present authors. This is the first example of free fermions in disguise with both claws and even holes simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general class of $n\times n$ random band matrices with bandwidth $W$. When $W^2\ll n$, we prove that with high probability the eigenvectors of such matrices are localized and decay exponentially at the sharp scale $W^2$. Combined with the delocalization results of Erd\H{o}s and Riabov [arXiv:2506.06441], and Yau and Yin [arXiv:2501.01718], this establishes the conjectured localization-delocalization transition for a large class of random band matrices.</description>

      <title>Weighted estimates for the Stokes semigroup in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for the Stokes system in the half-space, within the framework of weighted Lebesgue spaces. Introducing a new weight function defined via a product of powers of distances from fixed points, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for strong solutions to the Stokes problem in the half space. Our analysis generalizes previous results for the Stokes system in radial-weighted spaces (Galdi and Maremonti, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 25:7,2023; Maremonti and Pane, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 27:2,2025) and extends the theory to our setting. These results represent a first step toward the analysis of the Navier-Stokes system in weighted spaces, with applications in both half-space and exterior domain configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes that are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity coupled to the electric field of a static point charge obeying the equations of electromagnetism of Maxwell-Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky. The point charge is modeled as a naked singularity with non-positive bare mass. The singularity at the location of the charge is milder than that of the Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om solution to the conventional Einstein-Maxwell equations, and, contrary to what happens for the latter, the electric-field energy of these solutions is finite.</description>

      <title>Exact Analytical Traversable Wormhole Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity with the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley Massive Graviton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term. By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition $b'(r_0)&lt;1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an explicit cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a short proof of the limit of free energy of spherical 2 spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model without external field. This proof works for all temperatures and is based on the Laplace method of integration and considering a discrete approximation of the whole space. This proof is general enough and can be adapted to any interaction matrix where the eigenvalue distribution has some nice properties. The proof in the high-temperature case is the same as the proof given in [BK19]. However, the low-temperature case is new.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Geometry of supergravity and the Batalin--Vilkovisky formulation of the $\mathcal N=1$ theory in ten dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide full details of a BV formulation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions, to all orders in fermions, built from the generalised geometry description of the theory. In contrast to standard treatments, we introduce neither the degrees of freedom corresponding to orthonormal frames for the metric nor the local Lorentz symmetries that remove them again. Instead, we observe that the field space has a fibred structure, with the fermionic degrees of freedom spanning the fibres. We explain in detail how this geometric picture allows one to understand simultaneous variations of spinorial quantities and the metric with respect to which the spinor bundles are defined. This leads to additional terms in certain commutators on field space which account for the Lorentz transformation terms appearing in the calculation of the supersymmetry algebra. Unencumbered by the Lorentz degrees of freedom, we provide an efficient and full demonstration that our action satisfies the classical master equation.</description>

      <title>Round Aztec windows, a dual of the Aztec diamond theorem and a curious symmetry of the correlation of diagonal slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairly shortly after the publication of the Aztec diamond theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp in 1992, interest arose in finding the number of domino tilings of an Aztec diamond with an ``Aztec window,'' i.e.\ a hole in the shape of a smaller Aztec diamond at its center. Several intriguing patterns were discovered for the number of tilings of such regions, but the numbers themselves were not ``round'' -- they didn't seem to be given by a simple product formula. In this paper we consider a very closely related shape of holes (namely, odd Aztec rectangles), and prove that a large variety of regions obtained from Aztec rectangles by making such holes in them possess the sought-after property that the number of their domino tilings is given by a simple product formula. We find the same to be true for certain symmetric cruciform regions. We also consider graphs obtained from a toroidal Aztec diamond by making such holes in them, and prove a simple formula that governs the way the number of their perfect matchings changes under a natural evolution of the holes. This yields in particular a natural dual of the Aztec diamond theorem. Some implications for the correlation of such holes are also presented, including an unexpected symmetry for the correlation of diagonal slits on the square grid.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Moments and the Basic Equilibrium Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the classical theory of moments of configurations of weighted points with a focus on systems with an identically vanishing first moment. The latter condition produces equations for equilibrium configurations of systems of interacting particles under the sole condition that interactions are pairwise and along the line determined by each pair of particles. Complying external forces are admitted, so the description of some dynamical equilibrium configurations, such as relative equilibria, is included in our approach. Moments provide a unified framework for equilibrium problems in arbitrary dimensions. The equilibrium equations are homogeneous, of relatively low degree, invariant by oriented isometries (for interactions depending only on mutual distances), and are obtained through simple algebraic procedures requiring neither reduction by isometries nor a variational principle for their determination. Our equations include the renowned sets of $n$-body central configuration equations by O. Dziobek, and by A. Albouy and A. Chenciner. These equations are extended to a rather broad class of equilibrium problems, and several new sets of equilibrium equations are introduced. We also apply moments to establish a theory of constraints for mutual distances of configurations of fixed dimension and of co-spherical configurations, thus re-obtaining and adding to classical results by A. Cayley, among others.</description>

      <title>Non-Trivial Renormalization of Spin-Boson Models with Supercritical Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the non-trivial, renormalized Hamiltonian for a class of spin-boson models with supercritical form factors, including the one describing the Weisskopf-Wigner spontaneous emission. The renormalization is performed through both a self-energy and mass renormalization, in the so-called Hamiltonian formalism of constructive quantum field theory, implemented by a non-unitary dressing transformation. This solves the problem of triviality for unitarily-renormalized supercritical spin-boson models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and prove two-term asymptotics for their Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. Moreover, when the underlying domain is convex, we obtain universal, non-asymptotic bounds that correctly reproduce the two leading terms in the asymptotics and depend on the domain only through simple geometric characteristics. Important ingredients in our proof are non-asymptotic versions of various Tauberian theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed two kinds of edge contractions for the affine super Yangian and a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$. In this article, we show that these two edge contractions are commutative with each other. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to some centralizer algebras of the universal enveloping algebra of $W$-superalgebras of type $A$. Using the edge contraction, we also show the compatibility of the coproduct for the affine super Yangian with the parabolic induction for a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$ in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Non-Classical Systems: A Large Deviation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any quasi-probability representation of a no-signaling system -- including quantum systems -- can be simulated via a purely classical scheme by allowing signed events and a cancellation procedure. This raises a fundamental question: What properties of the non-classical system does such a classical simulation fail to replicate? We answer by using large deviation theory to show that the probability of a large fluctuation under the classical simulation can be strictly greater than under the actual non-classical system. The key finding driving our result is that negativity in probability relaxes the data processing inequality of information theory. We propose this potential large deviation stability of quantum (and no-signaling) systems as a novel form of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Packaging II: A Group-Theoretic Framework for Packaging Under Finite, Compact, Higher-Form, and Hybrid Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry packaging is the phenomenon whereby, upon particle creation, all the internal quantum numbers (IQNs) become locked into a single irreducible representation (irrep) block of the gauge group, as required by locality and gauge invariance. The resulting packaged quantum states exhibit characteristic symmetry constraints and entanglement patterns. We develop a group-theoretic framework to describe the symmetry packaging for a variety of concrete symmetries and to classify the corresponding packaged states: \textbf{(1)} We prove that for any finite or compact group $G$, there exist $G$-associated packaged subspaces, in which every vector is automatically a packaged state. In particular, in multi-particle systems, any nontrivial representation of $G$ induces inseparable packaged entanglement that locks together all IQNs. \textbf{(2)} We apply this framework to symmetry packaging in finite groups (cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_N$, charge conjugation $C$, fermion parity, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and dihedral groups), compact groups ($\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(N)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$), $p$-form symmetries, and hybrid symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules forbid the factorization of the resulting states. We illustrate how Bell-type packaged entangled states, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations all arise naturally. These results yield a complete classification of packaged quantum states. \textbf{(3)} Finally, we extend the packaging principle to incorporate full spacetime symmetry and hybrid systems of local, global, and Lorentz/Poincar\'e charges. Our approach unifies tools from group theory, gauge theory, and topological classification. These results may be useful for potential applications in high energy physics, quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a 0-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed 4-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ -- to obtain an everywhere non-degenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is non-singular, but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction thus shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Cliffords, Matchgates and Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework of topological complexity to study the computational complexity of quantum circuits and tensor networks. Within this framework, we establish the Quon Classical Simulation (QCS) for hybrid Clifford-Matchgate circuits, which is efficient for both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits, therefore answering a long standing open question on unifying efficient classical simulations. This framework is built upon the Quon language, a 2+1D topological quantum field theory with space-time boundary and defects. Its exponential computation complexity is captured by Magic holes, a topological feature capturing the global long-range entanglement. Both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of Magic holes. Efficient classical simulations of Cliffords and Matchgates are implemented by two parallel operations, generalized surgery theory of 3-manifolds and Yang-Baxter relations on the 2D boundary respectively, with additional binary arithmetic properties.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure scalars constructed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor for the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ and $T$ are the Ricci scalar and the trace of energy-momentum tensor, respectively), and also the way these quantities influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. In absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is found to be influenced by the structure scalar $X_{TF}$ and the mass-function of the collapsing matter. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of the various physical parameters like heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy on the structure scalars, have been clearly indicated along with a discussion on the complexity factor of the collapsing configuration. The $f(R,T)$ junction conditions have been presented, showing the matching conditions for the matter Lagrangian and their derivatives at the boundary. The energy conditions are also presented and the possibility of violation of the Strong Energy Condition has been discussed.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, and is a nonlinear version of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing $n$-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every $d\geq 1$ spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities and, correspondingly, higher derivatives of local averages. Using Malyshev's formula for the cumulant expansion, and keeping the leading order, the result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum of products of correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. The sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call minimal connected covers. We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and how it vanishes in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It is justified by the central limit theorem, and represents degrees of freedom forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It is the basis for fluctuating hydrodynamics, where it appears along with bare diffusion terms related to the noise covariance by the Einstein relation. In one spatial dimension, nonlinearities are relevant and may modify the corrections to ballistic behaviours by superdiffusive effects. But in systems where no shocks appear, such as linearly degenerate and integrable systems, the diffusive scaling of these corrections stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is given by a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been projected out, and that nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. With these ingredients, we obtain a well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, as a stochastic PDE. It describes the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale of connected correlation functions, self-consistently organised via a cumulant expansion. The resulting anomalous hydrodynamic equation for average densities takes into account both long-range correlations and bare diffusion, generalising recent results. Despite these anomalies, two-point functions satisfy an ordinary diffusion equation, with diffusion matrix determined by the Kubo formula. In integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise, hence bare diffusion, must vanish, as was conjectured recently, and argue that under an appropriate gauge of the currents, this is true at all orders. Thus the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory give the all-order hydrodynamic theory for integrable models.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing superconformal blocks for correlators of general supermultiplets in theories with $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ symmetry, such as four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ conformal theories. We use analytic superspace, viewed as the super-Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(m|n,2m|2n)$, which includes 4D Minkowski space ($m=2,n=0$). In this formalism, superblocks for non-half-BPS correlators are analogous to non-supersymmetric conformal blocks for correlators of fields with spin. We construct $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$-covariant differential operators which generalise the existing conformal weight-shifting operators, and thus allow us to derive all superconformal blocks from the known half-BPS blocks. Our results provide a framework from which to advance the conformal bootstrap in 4D supersymmetric settings, with potential extensions to lower and higher-dimensional SCFTs. The Grassmannian formalism is also seen to offer a natural and often simpler alternative to the embedding space formalism of non-supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

      <title>A-type open $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain the eigenfunctions of the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter $\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral generalized to the complex field.</description>
