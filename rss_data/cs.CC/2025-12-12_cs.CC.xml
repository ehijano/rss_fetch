      <title>Improved Small Set Expansion in High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small set expansion in high dimensional expanders is of great importance, e.g., towards proving cosystolic expansion, local testability of codes and constructions of good quantum codes.
  In this work we improve upon the state of the art results of small set expansion in high dimensional expanders. Our improvement is either on the expansion quality or on the size of sets for which expansion is guaranteed.
  One line of previous works [KM22, DD24] has obtained weak expansion for small sets, which is sufficient for deducing cosystolic expansion of one dimension below. We improve upon their result by showing strong expansion for small sets.
  Another line of works [KKL14, EK16, KM21] has shown strong expansion for small sets. However, they obtain it only for very small sets. We get an exponential improvement on the size of sets for which expansion is guaranteed by these prior works.
  Interestingly, our result is obtained by bridging between these two lines of works. The works of [KM22, DD24] use global averaging operators in order to obtain expansion for larger sets. However, their method could be utilized only on sets that are cocycle-like. We show how to combine these global averaging operators with ideas from the so-called ``fat machinery'' of [KKL14, EK16, KM21] in order to apply them for general sets.</description>

      <title>From Alternation to FPRAS: Toward a Complexity Classification of Approximate Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting problems are fundamental across mathematics and computer science. Among the most subtle are those whose associated decision problem is solvable in polynomial time, yet whose exact counting version appears intractable. For some such problems, however, one can still obtain efficient randomized approximation in the form of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). Existing proofs of FPRAS existence are often highly technical and problem-specific, offering limited insight into a more systematic complexity-theoretic account of approximability. In this work, we propose a machine-based framework for establishing the existence of an FPRAS beyond previous uniform criteria. Our starting point is alternating computation: we introduce a counting model obtained by equipping alternating Turing machines with a transducer-style output mechanism, and we use it to define a corresponding counting class spanALP. We show that every problem in spanALP admits an FPRAS, yielding a reusable sufficient condition that can be applied via reductions to alternating logspace, polynomial-time computation with output. We situate spanALP in the counting complexity landscape as strictly between #L and TotP (assuming RP $\neq$ NP) and observe interesting conceptual and technical gaps in the current machinery counting complexity. Moreover, as an illustrative application, we obtain an FPRAS for counting answers to counting the answers Dyck-constrained path queries in edge-labeled graphs, i.e., counting the number of distinct labelings realized by s-t walks whose label sequence is well-formed with respect to a Dyck-like language. To our knowledge, no FPRAS was previously known for this setting. We expect the alternating-transducer characterization to provide a broadly applicable tool for establishing FPRAS existence for further counting problems.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Instances for Scheduling and Packing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two instances $(I,k)$ and $(I',k')$ of a parameterized problem $P$ are equivalent if they have the same set of solutions (static equivalent) or if the set of solutions of $(I,k)$ can be constructed by the set of solutions for $(I',k')$ and some computable pre-solutions. If the algorithm constructing such a (static) equivalent instance whose size is polynomial bounded runs in fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) time, we say that there exists a (static) equivalent instance for this problem. In this paper we present (static) equivalent instances for Scheduling and Knapsack problems. We improve the bound for the $\ell_1$-norm of an equivalent vector given by Eisenbrand, Hunkenschr\"oder, Klein, Kouteck\'y, Levin, and Onn and show how this yields equivalent instances for integer linear programs (ILPs) and related problems. We obtain an $O(MN^2\log(NU))$ static equivalent instance for feasibility ILPs where $M$ is the number of constraints, $N$ is the number of variables and $U$ is an upper bound for the $\ell_\infty$-norm of the smallest feasible solution. With this, we get an $O(n^2\log(n))$ static equivalent instance for Knapsack where $n$ is the number of items. Moreover, we give an $O(M^2N\log(NM\Delta))$ kernel for feasibility ILPs where $\Delta$ is an upper bound for the $\ell_\infty$-norm of the given constraint matrix.
  Using balancing results by Knop et al., the ConfILP and a proximity result by Eisenbrand and Weismantel we give an $O(d^2\log(p_{\max}))$ equivalent instance for LoadBalancing, a generalization of scheduling problems. Here $d$ is the number of different processing times and $p_{\max}$ is the largest processing time.</description>

      <title>Optimal learning of quantum channels in diamond distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory and a key primitive for characterising noisy quantum devices. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}} k/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.</description>

Abstract: We revisit and extend some topics that we studied in our previous works (Rinott, Kalai and Shoham 2022; Kalai, Rinott and Shoham, 2023,2024) regarding the Google 2019 "quantum supremacy" experiment. We extend our analysis of the prediction based on Google's digital error model (Formula (77)), based on more detailed data provided by Google. We also provide some preliminary analysis for a few other NISQ experiments.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.</description>

      <title>Unconditional correctness of recent quantum algorithms for factoring and computing discrete logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1994, Shor introduced his famous quantum algorithm to factor integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time. In 2023, Regev proposed a multi-dimensional version of Shor's algorithm that requires far fewer quantum gates. His algorithm relies on a number-theoretic conjecture on the elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ that can be written as short products of very small prime numbers. We prove a version of this conjecture using tools from analytic number theory such as zero-density estimates. As a result, we obtain an unconditional proof of correctness of this improved quantum algorithm and of subsequent variants.</description>
