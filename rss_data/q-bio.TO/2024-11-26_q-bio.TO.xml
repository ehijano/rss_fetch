      <title>Novel Cisplatin-Magnetoliposome Complex Shows Enhanced Antitumor Activity via Hyperthermia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several methods to improve cancer patient survival rates by inducing hyperthermia in tumor tissues, which involves raising their temperature above 41{\deg}C. These methods utilize different energy sources to deliver heat to the target region, including light, microwaves or radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. We have developed a new, magnetically responsive nanocarrier, consisting of liposomes loaded with magnetic nanoparticles and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), commonly known as Cisplatin. The resulting magnetoliposome (ML) is rapidly internalized by lung and pancreas tumor cell lines, stored in intracellular vesicles, and capable of inducing hyperthermia under magnetic fields. The ML has no significant toxicity both in vitro and in vivo and, most importantly, enhances cell death by apoptosis after magnetic hyperthermia. Remarkably, mice bearing induced lung tumors, treated with CDDP-loaded nanocarriers and subjected to an applied electromagnetic field, showed an improved survival rate over those treated with either soluble CDDP or hyperthermia alone. Therefore, our approach of magnetic hyperthermia plus CDDP-ML significantly enhances in vitro cell death and in vivo survival of treated animals.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>Evaluaci\'on del Cambio en la Musculatura y Adiposidad y su Relaci\'on con la Recurrencia del Carcinoma de Cabeza y Cuello mediante PET/CT y MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of changes in body composition and follow-up imaging modalities on recurrence and prognosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The results indicate that an increase in the adiposity index post-radiotherapy is significantly associated with higher recurrence and mortality rates. Additionally, the combined evaluation of muscle and adipose status reveals that patients with muscle loss and adipose gain have the lowest survival probabilities and the highest risk of recurrence. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring adiposity and muscle status, as well as the strategic use of advanced imaging techniques such as PET/CT, MRI, and CT. However, this work represents a preliminary analysis, and further detailed studies are necessary to confirm these results and develop more effective strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>
