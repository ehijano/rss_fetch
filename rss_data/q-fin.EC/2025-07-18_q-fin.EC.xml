      <title>Third-Party Credit Guarantees and the Cost of Debt: Evidence from Corporate Loans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a comprehensive dataset collected by the Federal Reserve, I find that over one-third of corporate loans issued by US banks are fully guaranteed by legal entities separate from borrowing firms. Using an empirical strategy that accounts for time-varying firm and lender effects, I find that the existence of a third-party credit guarantee is negatively related to loan risk, loan rate, and loan delinquency. Third party credit guarantees alleviate the effect of collateral constraints in credit market. Firms (particularly smaller firms) that experience a negative shock to their asset values are less likely to use collateral and more likely to use credit guarantees in new borrowings.</description>

      <title>Funding advantage and market discipline in the Canadian banking sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a comprehensive data set and a variety of methods to provide evidence on the magnitude of large banks' funding advantage in Canada in addition to the extent to which market discipline exists across different securities issued by the Canadian banks. The banking sector in Canada provides a unique setting in which to examine market discipline along with the prospects of proposed reforms because Canada has no history of government bailouts, and an implicit government guarantee has been in effect consistently since the 1920s. We find that large banks have a funding advantage over small banks after controlling for bank-specific and market risk factors. Large banks on average pay 80 basis points and 70 basis points less, respectively, on their deposits and subordinated debt. Working with hand-collected market data on debt issues by large banks, we also find that market discipline exists for subordinated debt and not for senior debt.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Market Power in Firm-to-Firm Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of bargaining in firm-to-firm trade with two-sided market power. The framework accommodates flexible market structures, yielding analytical expressions for pair-specific markups and pass-through elasticities. In U.S. import data, we estimate strong importer bargaining power and an upward-sloping export supply curve, consistent with oligopsony power. Pass-through of the 2018 tariffs in firm-to-firm relationships is incomplete, in contrast to product-level studies, primarily due to exporter cost reductions driven by falling demand from dominant buyers. Our study highlights how bargaining and network rigidities shape price outcomes, with implications for markup dispersion and shock propagation in global value chains.</description>

      <title>Do Governments React to Public Debt Accumulation? A Cross-Country Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do governments adjust budgetary policy to rising public debt, precluding fiscal unsustainability? Using budget data for 52 industrial and emerging economies since 1990, we apply panel methods accounting for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneous fiscal conduct. We find that a primary-balance rule with tax-smoothing motives and responsiveness to debt has robust explanatory power in describing fiscal behavior. Controlling for temporary output, temporary spending, and the current account balance, a 10-percentage-point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio raises the long-run primary surplus-to-GDP ratio by 0.5 percentage points on average. Corrective adjustments hold across high- and low-debt countries and across industrial and emerging economies. Our results imply many governments pursue Ricardian policy designs, avoiding Ponzi-type financing.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Bribery, Technology Choice, and Capital Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production, entry, and technological decisions of firms in the presence of bribery. We find that bribery can be justified even in the absence of bureaucratic inefficiencies. We document substantial technology-specific heterogeneity in bribery in 148 countries and incorporate it into a general equilibrium model, where firms use capital-intensive or labor-intensive technology. When bribery more heavily affects less efficient labor-intensive firms, resources move toward more efficient capital-intensive firms, resulting in higher capital accumulation and aggregate output. In poorer countries, the elimination of bribery only for capital-intensive firms increases the capital stock by 18.7% more and the aggregate output by 3.4% more than the complete elimination of bribery. In wealthier countries, the elimination of bribery only for capital-intensive firms increases the capital stock by 44.4% more and the aggregate output by 15.4% more than the complete elimination of bribery. Our findings challenge the established view of bribery as uniformly harmful.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Improvement of Accessibility achieved via Shared Mobility on Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared Mobility Services (SMS), e.g., demand-responsive transport or ride-sharing, can improve mobility in low-density areas, which are often poorly served by conventional Public Transport (PT). Such improvement is generally measured via basic performance indicators, such as waiting or travel time. However, such basic indicators do not account for the most important contribution that SMS can provide to territories, i.e., increasing the potential, for users, to reach surrounding opportunities, such as jobs, schools, businesses, etc. Such potential can be measured by isochrone-based accessibility indicators, which count the number of opportunities reachable in a limited time, and are thus easy for the public to understand. %
The potential impact of SMS on accessibility has been qualitatively discussed and implications on equity have been empirically studied. However, to date, there are no quantitative methods to compute isochrone-based indicators of the accessibility achieved via SMS.
  This work fills this gap by proposing a first method to compute isochrone accessibility of PT systems composed of conventional PT and SMS, acting as a feeder for access and egress trips to/from PT hubs. This method is grounded on spatial-temporal statistical analysis, performed via Kriging. It takes as input observed trips of SMS and summarizes them in a graph. On such a graph, isochrone accessibility indicators are computed. We apply the proposed method to a MATSim simulation study concerning demand-responsive transport integrated into PT, in the suburban area of Paris-Saclay.</description>
