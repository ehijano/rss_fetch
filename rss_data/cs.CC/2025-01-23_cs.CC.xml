      <title>The Optimization of Random Tree Codes for Limited Computational Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an achievability bound on the frame error rate of random tree code ensembles under a sequential decoding algorithm with a hard computational limit and consider the optimization of the random tree code ensembles over their branching structures/profiles and the decoding measure. Through numerical examples, we show that the achievability bound for the optimizated random tree codes can approach the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding performance of pure random codes.</description>

      <title>Iterative Optimization of Multidimensional Functions on Turing Machines under Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the effective convergence of iterative methods for solving convex minimization problems using block Gauss--Seidel algorithms. It investigates whether it is always possible to algorithmically terminate the iteration in such a way that the outcome of the iterative algorithm satisfies any predefined error bound. It is shown that the answer is generally negative. Specifically, it is shown that even if a computable continuous function which is convex in each variable possesses computable minimizers, a block Gauss--Seidel iterative method might not be able to effectively compute any of these minimizers. This means that it is impossible to algorithmically terminate the iteration such that a given performance guarantee is satisfied. The paper discusses two reasons for this behavior. First, it might happen that certain steps in the Gauss--Seidel iteration cannot be effectively implemented on a digital computer. Second, all computable minimizers of the problem may not be reachable by the Gauss--Seidel method. Simple and concrete examples for both behaviors are provided.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of parametrized quantum circuits under non-unital noise through Pauli backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum devices continue to grow in size but remain affected by noise, it is crucial to determine when and how they can outperform classical computers on practical tasks. A central piece in this effort is to develop the most efficient classical simulation algorithms possible. Among the most promising approaches are Pauli backpropagation algorithms, which have already demonstrated their ability to efficiently simulate certain classes of parameterized quantum circuits-a leading contender for near-term quantum advantage-under random circuit assumptions and depolarizing noise. However, their efficiency was not previously established for more realistic non-unital noise models, such as amplitude damping, that better capture noise on existing hardware. Here, we close this gap by adapting Pauli backpropagation to non-unital noise, proving that it remains efficient even under these more challenging conditions. Our proof leverages a refined combinatorial analysis to handle the complexities introduced by non-unital channels, thus strengthening Pauli backpropagation as a powerful tool for simulating near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and updates for conjunctive linear algebra queries through expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the importance of linear algebra and matrix operations in data analytics, there is significant interest in using relational query optimization and processing techniques for evaluating (sparse) linear algebra programs. In particular, in recent years close connections have been established between linear algebra programs and relational algebra that allow transferring optimization techniques of the latter to the former. In this paper, we ask ourselves which linear algebra programs in MATLANG correspond to the free-connex and q-hierarchical fragments of conjunctive first-order logic. Both fragments have desirable query processing properties: free-connex conjunctive queries support constant-delay enumeration after a linear-time preprocessing phase, and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries further allow constant-time updates. By characterizing the corresponding fragments of MATLANG, we hence identify the fragments of linear algebra programs that one can evaluate with constant-delay enumeration after linear-time preprocessing and with constant-time updates. To derive our results, we improve and generalize previous correspondences between MATLANG and relational algebra evaluated over semiring-annotated relations. In addition, we identify properties on semirings that allow to generalize the complexity bounds for free-connex and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries from Boolean annotations to general semirings.</description>

      <title>A Structural Complexity Analysis of Hierarchical Task Network Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a refined complexity-theoretic analysis of three classical problems in the context of Hierarchical Task Network Planning: the verification of a provided plan, whether an executable plan exists, and whether a given state can be reached. Our focus lies on identifying structural properties which yield tractability. We obtain new polynomial algorithms for all three problems on a natural class of primitive networks, along with corresponding lower bounds. We also obtain an algorithmic meta-theorem for lifting polynomial-time solvability from primitive to general task networks, and prove that its preconditions are tight. Finally, we analyze the parameterized complexity of the three problems.</description>

      <title>Modular Counting CSP: Reductions and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04224</link>

Abstract: The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is ubiquitous in various areas of mathematics and computer science. Many of its variations have been studied including the Counting CSP, where the goal is to find the number of solutions to a CSP instance. The complexity of finding the exact number of solutions of a CSP is well understood (Bulatov, 2013, and Dyer and Richerby, 2013) and the focus has shifted to other variations of the Counting CSP such as counting the number of solutions modulo an integer. This problem has attracted considerable attention recently. In the case of CSPs based on undirected graphs Bulatov and Kazeminia (STOC 2022) obtained a complexity classification for the problem of counting solutions modulo p for arbitrary prime p. In this paper we report on the progress made towards a similar classification for the general CSP, not necessarily based on graphs.
  We identify several features that make the general case very different from the graph case such as a stronger form of rigidity and the structure of automorphisms of powers of relational structures. We provide a solution algorithm in the case p=2 that works under some additional conditions and prove the hardness of the problem under some assumptions about automorphisms of the powers of the relational structure. We also reduce the general CSP to the case that only uses binary relations satisfying strong additional conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards the Pseudorandomness of Expander Random Walks for Read-Once ACC0 circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expander graphs are among the most useful combinatorial objects in theoretical computer science. A line of work studies random walks on expander graphs for their pseudorandomness against various classes of test functions, including symmetric functions, read-only branching programs, permutation branching programs, and $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits. The promising results of pseudorandomness of expander random walks against $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits indicate a robustness of expander random walks beyond symmetric functions, motivating the question of whether expander random walks can fool more robust \emph{asymmetric} complexity classes, such as $\mathrm{ACC}^0$. In this work, we make progress towards this question by considering certain two-layered circuit compositions of $\mathrm{MOD}[k]$ gates, where we show that these family of circuits are fooled by expander random walks with total variation distance error $O(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the underlying expander graph. For $k\geq 3$, these circuits can be highly asymmetric with complicated Fourier characters. In this context, our work takes a step in the direction of fooling more complex asymmetric circuits. Separately, drawing from the learning-theory literature, we construct an explicit threshold circuit in the circuit family $\mathrm{TC}^0$, and show that it is \emph{not} fooled by expander random walk, providing an upper bound on the set of functions fooled by expander random walks.</description>
