      <title>Learning DFAs from Positive Examples Only via Word Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning finite automata from positive examples has recently gained attention as a powerful approach for understanding, explaining, analyzing, and verifying black-box systems. The motivation for focusing solely on positive examples arises from the practical limitation that we can only observe what a system is capable of (positive examples) but not what it cannot do (negative examples). Unlike the classical problem of passive DFA learning with both positive and negative examples, which has been known to be NP-complete since the 1970s, the topic of learning DFAs exclusively from positive examples remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a novel perspective on this problem by leveraging the concept of counting the number of accepted words up to a carefully determined length. Our contributions are twofold. First, we prove that computing the minimal number of words up to this length accepted by DFAs of a given size that accept all positive examples is NP-complete, establishing that learning from positive examples alone is computationally demanding. Second, we propose a new learning algorithm with a better asymptotic runtime that the best-known bound for existing algorithms. While our experimental evaluation reveals that this algorithm under-performs state-of-the-art methods, it demonstrates significant potential as a preprocessing step to enhance existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Testing noisy low-degree polynomials for sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing whether an unknown low-degree polynomial $p$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is sparse versus far from sparse, given access to noisy evaluations of the polynomial $p$ at \emph{randomly chosen points}. This is a property-testing analogue of classical problems on learning sparse low-degree polynomials with noise, extending the work of Chen, De, and Servedio (2020) from noisy \emph{linear} functions to general low-degree polynomials.
  Our main result gives a \emph{precise characterization} of when sparsity testing for low-degree polynomials admits constant sample complexity independent of dimension, together with a matching constant-sample algorithm in that regime. For any mean-zero, variance-one finitely supported distribution $\boldsymbol{X}$ over the reals, degree $d$, and any sparsity parameters $s \leq T$, we define a computable function $\mathrm{MSG}_{\boldsymbol{X},d}(\cdot)$, and:
  - For $T \ge \mathrm{MSG}_{\boldsymbol{X},d}(s)$, we give an $O_{s,\boldsymbol{X},d}(1)$-sample algorithm that distinguishes whether a multilinear degree-$d$ polynomial over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is $s$-sparse versus $\varepsilon$-far from $T$-sparse, given examples $(\boldsymbol{x},\, p(\boldsymbol{x}) + \mathrm{noise})_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim \boldsymbol{X}^{\otimes n}}$. Crucially, the sample complexity is \emph{completely independent} of the ambient dimension $n$.
  - For $T \leq \mathrm{MSG}_{\boldsymbol{X},d}(s) - 1$, we show that even without noise, any algorithm given samples $(\boldsymbol{x},p(\boldsymbol{x}))_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim \boldsymbol{X}^{\otimes n}}$ must use $\Omega_{\boldsymbol{X},d,s}(\log n)$ examples.
  Our techniques employ a generalization of the results of Dinur et al. (2007) on the Fourier tails of bounded functions over $\{0,1\}^n$ to a broad range of finitely supported distributions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic super-resolution in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of \emph{super-resolution}, roughly speaking, is to reconstruct an unknown signal to high accuracy, given (potentially noisy) information about its low-degree Fourier coefficients. Prior results on super-resolution have imposed strong modeling assumptions on the signal, typically requiring that it is a linear combination of spatially separated point sources.
  In this work we analyze a very general version of the super-resolution problem, by considering completely general signals over the $d$-dimensional torus $[0,1)^d$; we do not assume any spatial separation between point sources, or even that the signal is a finite linear combination of point sources. We obtain two sets of results, corresponding to two natural notions of reconstruction.
  - {\bf Reconstruction in Wasserstein distance:} We give essentially matching upper and lower bounds on the cutoff frequency $T$ and the magnitude $\kappa$ of the noise for which accurate reconstruction in Wasserstein distance is possible. Roughly speaking, our results here show that for $d$-dimensional signals, estimates of $\approx \exp(d)$ many Fourier coefficients are necessary and sufficient for accurate reconstruction under the Wasserstein distance.
  - {\bf "Heavy hitter" reconstruction:} For nonnegative signals (equivalently, probability distributions), we introduce a new notion of "heavy hitter" reconstruction that essentially amounts to achieving high-accuracy reconstruction of all "sufficiently dense" regions of the distribution. Here too we give essentially matching upper and lower bounds on the cutoff frequency $T$ and the magnitude $\kappa$ of the noise for which accurate reconstruction is possible. Our results show that -- in sharp contrast with Wasserstein reconstruction -- accurate estimates of only $\approx \exp(\sqrt{d})$ many Fourier coefficients are necessary and sufficient for heavy hitter reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Graph Classes Closed under Self-intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class is monotone if it is closed under taking subgraphs. It is known that a monotone class defined by finitely many obstructions has bounded treewidth if and only if one of the obstructions is a so-called tripod, that is, a disjoint union of trees with exactly one vertex of degree 3 and paths. This dichotomy also characterizes exactly those monotone graph classes for which many NP-hard algorithmic problems admit polynomial-time algorithms. These algorithmic dichotomies, however, do not extend to the universe of all hereditary classes, which are classes closed under taking induced subgraphs. This leads to the natural question of whether we can extend known algorithmic dichotomies for monotone classes to larger families of hereditary classes. We give an affirmative answer to this question by considering the family of hereditary graph classes that are closed under self-intersection, which is known to be located strictly between the monotone and hereditary classes. We prove a new structural characterization of graphs in self-intersection-closed classes excluding a tripod. We use our characterization to give a complete dichotomy of Maximum Independent Set, and its weighted variant for self-intersection-closed classes defined by finitely many obstructions: these problems are in P if the class excludes a tripod and NP-hard otherwise. This generalizes several known results on Maximum Independent Set. We also use it to obtain dichotomies for Maximum Induced Matching on self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions. Similarly, we obtain dichotomies for Satisfiability and Counting Satisfiability on self-intersection-closed classes of (bipartite) incidence graphs defined by finitely many obstructions, and for boundedness of clique-width for self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions.</description>

      <title>Semi-Algebraic Proof Systems for QBF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new semi-algebraic proof systems for Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) analogous to the propositional systems Nullstellensatz, Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares. We transfer to this setting techniques both from the QBF literature (strategy extraction) and from propositional proof complexity (size-degree relations and pseudo-expectation). We obtain a number of strong QBF lower bounds and separations between these systems, even when disregarding propositional hardness.</description>

      <title>Gateways to Tractability for Satisfiability in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Extensional ESO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensional ESO is a fragment of existential second-order logic (ESO) that captures the following family of problems. Given a fixed ESO sentence $\Psi$ and an input structure $\mathbb A$ the task if to decide whether there is an extension $\mathbb B$ of $\mathbb A$ that satisfies the first-order part of $\Psi$, i.e., a structure $\mathbb B$ such that $R^{\mathbb A}\subseteq R^{\mathbb B}$ for every existentially quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$, and $R^{\mathbb A} = R^{\mathbb B}$ for every non-quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$. In particular, extensional ESO describes all pre-coloured finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
  In this paper we study the computational power of extensional ESO; we ask, for which problems in NP is there a polynomial-time equivalent problem in extensional ESO?. One of our main results states that extensional ESO has the same computational power as hereditary first-order logic. We also characterize the computational power of the fragment of extensional ESO with monotone universal first-order part in terms of finitely bounded CSPs. These results suggest a rich computational power of this logic, and we conjecture that extensional ESO captures NP-intermediate problems. We further support this conjecture by showing that extensional ESO can express current candidate NP-intermediate problems such as Graph Isomorphism, and Monotone Dualization (up to polynomial-time equivalence). On the other hand, another main result proves that extensional ESO does not have the full computational power of NP: there are problems in NP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in extensional ESP (unless E=NE).</description>

      <title>Parameterized Spanning Tree Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Spanning Tree Congestion problem, where we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and are asked to find a spanning tree $T$ of minimum maximum congestion. Here, the congestion of an edge $e\in T$ is the number of edges $uv\in E$ such that the (unique) path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ traverses $e$. We consider this well-studied NP-hard problem from the point of view of (structural) parameterized complexity and obtain the following results.
  We resolve a natural open problem by showing that Spanning Tree Congestion is not FPT parameterized by treewidth (under standard assumptions). More strongly, we present a generic reduction which applies to (almost) any parameter of the form ``vertex-deletion distance to class $\mathcal{C}$'', thus obtaining W[1]-hardness for parameters more restricted than treewidth, including tree-depth plus feedback vertex set, or incomparable to treewidth, such as twin cover. Via a slight tweak of the same reduction we also show that the problem is NP-complete on graphs of modular-width $4$.
  Even though it is known that Spanning Tree Congestion remains NP-hard on instances with only one vertex of unbounded degree, it is currently open whether the problem remains hard on bounded-degree graphs. We resolve this question by showing NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree 8.
  Complementing the problem's W[1]-hardness for treewidth...</description>
