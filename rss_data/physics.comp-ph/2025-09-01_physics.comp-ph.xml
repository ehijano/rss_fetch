      <title>Fast Methods For Multisite Charge Transfer Processes I: Constrained, State Averaged CASSCF(1,M) and CASSCF(2M-1,M) Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a dynamically-weighted state-averaged constrained CASSCF to treat \ul{e}lectrons or \ul{h}oles moving between $n$ molecular fragments (where $n$ can be larger than 2). Within such a so-called eDSCn/hDSCn approach, we consider configurations that are mutually single excitations of each other, and we apply a generalized set of constraints to tailor the method for studying charge transfer problems. The constrained optimization problem is efficiently solved using a DIIS-SQP algorithm, thus maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate the method for a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, successfully reproducing the expected exponential decay of diabatic couplings with distance. When combined with a gradient, the current extension immediately enables efficient nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of complex multi-state charge transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Fast Methods For Multisite Charge Transfer Processes II: Analytic Nuclear Gradients and Nonadiabatic Dynamics For cCASSCF(1,M) and cCASSCF(2M-1,M) Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and implement analytic nuclear gradients and derivative couplings for a constrained Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field with a small active space designed to model electron or hole transfer. Using a Lagrangian formalism, we are able to differentiate both the CASSCF energy and the constraint (which is required for globally smooth surfaces), and the resulting efficient algorithm can be immediately applied to nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of charge transfer processes. Here, we run initial surface-hopping simulations of a proton coupled electron transfer event for a phenoxyl-phenol system.</description>

      <title>GPU-acceleration of the Discontinuous Galerkin Shallow Water Equations Solver (DG-SWEM) using CUDA and OpenACC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a porting of DG-SWEM, a discontinuous Galerkin solver for coastal ocean circulation, and in particular storm surge, to GPU using two separate approaches: CUDA Fortran and OpenACC. Time-explicit discontinuous Galerkin methods have been shown to exhibit a large amount of data parallelism due to the loose coupling between elements, and thus are naturally mapped to the GPU architecture. For each porting approach, we discuss the code design, ease of programming, and performance when running on realistic use cases. Specifically for the OpenACC version, we also aim to preserve maintainability within the same codebase through using Unified Memory. We test the codes on NVIDIA's Grace Hopper chip and compare the GPU performance on each node to the MPI version on a single CPU node (144 cores).</description>

      <title>LREI: A fast numerical solver for quantum Landau-Lifshitz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop LREI (Low-Rank Eigenmode Integration), a memory- and time-efficient scheme for solving quantum Landau-Lifshitz (q-LL) and quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (q-LLG) equations, which govern spin dynamics in open quantum systems. Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping.</description>

      <title>Machine-precision energy conservative quadrature hyperreduction of Lagrangian hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an energy conservative, quadrature based model reduction framework for the compressible Euler equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics. Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>When Energy and Information Revolutions Meet 2D Janus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <title>Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</description>

      <title>Surface Stability Modeling with Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: A Comprehensive Cleavage Energy Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bayesian perspectives for quantum states and application to ab initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum many-electron problem is not just at the heart of condensed matter phenomena, but also essential for first-principles simulation of chemical phenomena. Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks, allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning) can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract correlation patterns in classical data.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in nearly-spherical molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2\,+\,2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>
