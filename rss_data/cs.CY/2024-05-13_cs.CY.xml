      <title>Automating Thematic Analysis: How LLMs Analyse Controversial Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising analytical tools. They can augment human epistemic, cognitive and reasoning abilities, and support 'sensemaking', making sense of a complex environment or subject by analysing large volumes of data with a sensitivity to context and nuance absent in earlier text processing systems. This paper presents a pilot experiment that explores how LLMs can support thematic analysis of controversial topics. We compare how human researchers and two LLMs GPT-4 and Llama 2 categorise excerpts from media coverage of the controversial Australian Robodebt scandal. Our findings highlight intriguing overlaps and variances in thematic categorisation between human and machine agents, and suggest where LLMs can be effective in supporting forms of discourse and thematic analysis. We argue LLMs should be used to augment, and not replace human interpretation, and we add further methodological insights and reflections to existing research on the application of automation to qualitative research methods. We also introduce a novel card-based design toolkit, for both researchers and practitioners to further interrogate LLMs as analytical tools.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Intelligence and Business Wargaming in Developing Foresight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business wargaming is a central tool for developing sustaining strategies. It transfers the benefits of traditional wargaming to the business environment. However, building wargames that support the process of decision-making for strategy require respective intelligence. This paper investigates the role of intelligence in the process of developing strategic foresight. The focus is on how intelligence is developed and how it relates to business wargaming. The so-called intelligence cycle is the basis and reference of our investigation.
  The conceptual part of the paper combines the theoretical background from military, business as well as serious gaming. To elaborate on some of the lessons learned, we examine specific business wargames both drawn from the literature and conducted by us at the Center for Intelligence and Security Studies (CISS). It is shown that business wargaming can make a significant contribution to the transformation of data to intelligence by supporting the intelligence cycle in two crucial phases. Furthermore, it brings together business intelligence (BI) and competitive intelligence (CI) and it bridges the gap to a company's strategy by either testing or developing a new strategy. We were also able to confirm this finding based on the business wargame we conducted at a major semiconductor manufacturer.</description>

      <title>Deciphering public attention to geoengineering and climate issues using machine learning and dynamic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the conversation around using geoengineering to combat climate change intensifies, it is imperative to engage the public and deeply understand their perspectives on geoengineering research, development, and potential deployment. Through a comprehensive data-driven investigation, this paper explores the types of news that captivate public interest in geoengineering. We delved into 30,773 English-language news articles from the BBC and the New York Times, combined with Google Trends data spanning 2018 to 2022, to explore how public interest in geoengineering fluctuates in response to news coverage of broader climate issues. Using BERT-based topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and time-series regression models, we found that positive sentiment in energy-related news serves as a good predictor of heightened public interest in geoengineering, a trend that persists over time. Our findings suggest that public engagement with geoengineering and climate action is not uniform, with some topics being more potent in shaping interest over time, such as climate news related to energy, disasters, and politics. Understanding these patterns is crucial for scientists, policymakers, and educators aiming to craft effective strategies for engaging with the public and fostering dialogue around emerging climate technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine Consciousness as Pseudoscience: The Myth of Conscious Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis of conscious machines has been debated since the invention of the notion of artificial intelligence, powered by the assumption that the computational intelligence achieved by a system is the cause of the emergence of phenomenal consciousness in that system as an epiphenomenon or as a consequence of the behavioral or internal complexity of the system surpassing some threshold. As a consequence, a huge amount of literature exploring the possibility of machine consciousness and how to implement it on a computer has been published. Moreover, common folk psychology and transhumanism literature has fed this hypothesis with the popularity of science fiction literature, where intelligent robots are usually antropomorphized and hence given phenomenal consciousness. However, in this work, we argue how these literature lacks scientific rigour, being impossible to falsify the opposite hypothesis, and illustrate a list of arguments that show how every approach that the machine consciousness literature has published depends on philosophical assumptions that cannot be proven by the scientific method. Concretely, we also show how phenomenal consciousness is not computable, independently on the complexity of the algorithm or model, cannot be objectively measured nor quantitatively defined and it is basically a phenomenon that is subjective and internal to the observer. Given all those arguments we end the work arguing why the idea of conscious machines is nowadays a myth of transhumanism and science fiction culture.</description>

      <title>Evidence of What, for Whom? The Socially Contested Role of Algorithmic Bias in a Predictive Policing Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical, qualitative study of the social role of algorithmic bias in the context of the Chicago crime prediction algorithm, a predictive policing tool that forecasts when and where in the city crime is most likely to occur. Through interviews with 18 Chicago-area community organizations, academic researchers, and public sector actors, we show that stakeholders from different groups articulate diverse problem diagnoses of the tool's algorithmic bias, strategically using it as evidence to advance criminal justice interventions that align with stakeholders' positionality and political ends. Drawing inspiration from Catherine D'Ignazio's taxonomy of "refusing and using" data, we find that stakeholders use evidence of algorithmic bias to reform the policies around police patrol allocation; reject algorithm-based policing interventions; reframe crime as a structural rather than interpersonal problem; reveal data on authority figures in an effort to subvert their power; repair and heal families and communities; and, in the case of more powerful actors, to reaffirm their own authority or existing power structures. We identify the implicit assumptions and scope of these varied uses of algorithmic bias as evidence, showing that they require different (and sometimes conflicting) values about policing and AI. This divergence reflects long-standing tensions in the criminal justice reform landscape between the values of liberation and healing often centered by system-impacted communities and the values of surveillance and deterrence often instantiated in data-driven reform measures. We advocate for centering the interests and experiential knowledge of communities impacted by incarceration to ensure that evidence of algorithmic bias can serve as a device to challenge the status quo.</description>

      <title>A View of How Language Models Will Transform Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most commentators have focused exclusively on how LLMs will transform day-to-day law practice, a substantial structural change could be afoot within the legal sector as a whole. Large increases in productivity and attendant cost savings could encourage law firms and corporate legal departments to develop large language models in-house. A ten percent increase in attorney productivity would encourage an average sized 'Big Law' firm to reduce its associate headcount by 300 to 400 lawyers. This represents cost savings of 60 to 120 million dollars - more than enough to pay for the development of a specialized LLM. Eventually, LLMs will push lawyers into highly specialized and nuanced roles. After fully mature LLMs arrive, the lawyer will continue to play a central role in legal practice, but only in non-routine legal tasks. These tasks will primarily involve value judgments, such as the development of precedent or its reversal, or the allocation of property and other scarce resources. This new mix of lawyer-machine labor, where machines primarily carry out routine legal tasks, and lawyers handle the non-routine, will give rise to a growing demand for lawyers who can exercise good judgment and empathize with the winners and losers of social change. Overall, the Article suggests a possible future where there are fewer lawyers and greater consolidation of the legal sector.</description>

      <title>AI and Machine Learning for Next Generation Science Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in science assessments. The paper begins with a discussion of the Framework for K-12 Science Education, which calls for a shift from conceptual learning to knowledge-in-use. This shift necessitates the development of new types of assessments that align with the Framework's three dimensions: science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts. The paper further highlights the limitations of traditional assessment methods like multiple-choice questions, which often fail to capture the complexities of scientific thinking and three-dimensional learning in science. It emphasizes the need for performance-based assessments that require students to engage in scientific practices like modeling, explanation, and argumentation. The paper achieves three major goals: reviewing the current state of ML-based assessments in science education, introducing a framework for scoring accuracy in ML-based automatic assessments, and discussing future directions and challenges. It delves into the evolution of ML-based automatic scoring systems, discussing various types of ML, like supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. These systems can provide timely and objective feedback, thus alleviating the burden on teachers. The paper concludes by exploring pre-trained models like BERT and finetuned ChatGPT, which have shown promise in assessing students' written responses effectively.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Lecture Content for Improved Feedback: Explorations with GPT-4 and Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the feedback generated by Large Language Models for programming tasks. For this purpose, corresponding lecture recordings were transcribed and made available to the Large Language Model GPT-4 as external knowledge source together with timestamps as metainformation by using RAG. The purpose of this is to prevent hallucinations and to enforce the use of the technical terms and phrases from the lecture. In an exercise platform developed to solve programming problems for an introductory programming lecture, students can request feedback on their solutions generated by GPT-4. For this task GPT-4 receives the students' code solution, the compiler output, the result of unit tests and the relevant passages from the lecture notes available through the use of RAG as additional context. The feedback generated by GPT-4 should guide students to solve problems independently and link to the lecture content, using the time stamps of the transcript as meta-information. In this way, the corresponding lecture videos can be viewed immediately at the corresponding positions. For the evaluation, students worked with the tool in a workshop and decided for each feedback whether it should be extended by RAG or not. First results based on a questionnaire and the collected usage data show that the use of RAG can improve feedback generation and is preferred by students in some situations. Due to the slower speed of feedback generation, the benefits are situation dependent.</description>

      <title>Mobile Sequencers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article is an attempt to contribute to explorations of a common origin for language and planned-collaborative action. It gives `semantics of change' the central stage in the synthesis, from its history and recordkeeping to its development, its syntax, delivery and reception, including substratal aspects.
  It is suggested that to arrive at a common core, linguistic semantics must be understood as studying through syntax mobile agent's representing, tracking and coping with change and no change. Semantics of actions can be conceived the same way, but through plans instead of syntax. The key point is the following: Sequencing itself, of words and action sequences, brings in more structural interpretation to the sequence than which is immediately evident from the sequents themselves. Mobile sequencers can be understood as subjects structuring reporting, understanding and keeping track of change and no change. The idea invites rethinking of the notion of category, both in language and in planning.
  Understanding understanding change by mobile agents is suggested to be about human extended practice, not extended-human practice. That's why linguistics is as important as computer science in the synthesis. It must rely on representational history of acts, thoughts and expressions, personal and public, crosscutting overtness and covertness of these phenomena. It has implication for anthropology in the extended practice, which is covered briefly.</description>

      <title>BLIP: Facilitating the Exploration of Undesirable Consequences of Digital Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital technologies have positively transformed society, but they have also led to undesirable consequences not anticipated at the time of design or development. We posit that insights into past undesirable consequences can help researchers and practitioners gain awareness and anticipate potential adverse effects. To test this assumption, we introduce BLIP, a system that extracts real-world undesirable consequences of technology from online articles, summarizes and categorizes them, and presents them in an interactive, web-based interface. In two user studies with 15 researchers in various computer science disciplines, we found that BLIP substantially increased the number and diversity of undesirable consequences they could list in comparison to relying on prior knowledge or searching online. Moreover, BLIP helped them identify undesirable consequences relevant to their ongoing projects, made them aware of undesirable consequences they "had never considered," and inspired them to reflect on their own experiences with technology.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While our understanding of fairness in machine learning has significantly progressed, our understanding of fairness in reinforcement learning (RL) remains nascent. Most of the attention has been on fairness in one-shot classification tasks; however, real-world, RL-enabled systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles) are much more complicated in that agents operate in dynamic environments over a long period of time. To ensure the responsible development and deployment of these systems, we must better understand fairness in RL. In this paper, we survey the literature to provide the most up-to-date snapshot of the frontiers of fairness in RL. We start by reviewing where fairness considerations can arise in RL, then discuss the various definitions of fairness in RL that have been put forth thus far. We continue to highlight the methodologies researchers used to implement fairness in single- and multi-agent RL systems before showcasing the distinct application domains that fair RL has been investigated in. Finally, we critically examine gaps in the literature, such as understanding fairness in the context of RLHF, that still need to be addressed in future work to truly operationalize fair RL in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Fair Graph Representation Learning via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group fairness for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which emphasizes algorithmic decisions neither favoring nor harming certain groups defined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race and gender), has gained considerable attention. In particular, the objective of group fairness is to ensure that the decisions made by GNNs are independent of the sensitive attribute. To achieve this objective, most existing approaches involve eliminating sensitive attribute information in node representations or algorithmic decisions. However, such ways may also eliminate task-related information due to its inherent correlation with the sensitive attribute, leading to a sacrifice in utility. In this work, we focus on improving the fairness of GNNs while preserving task-related information and propose a fair GNN framework named FairSAD. Instead of eliminating sensitive attribute information, FairSAD enhances the fairness of GNNs via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement (SAD), which separates the sensitive attribute-related information into an independent component to mitigate its impact. Additionally, FairSAD utilizes a channel masking mechanism to adaptively identify the sensitive attribute-related component and subsequently decorrelates it. Overall, FairSAD minimizes the impact of the sensitive attribute on GNN outcomes rather than eliminating sensitive attributes, thereby preserving task-related information associated with the sensitive attribute. Furthermore, experiments conducted on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FairSAD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of both fairness and utility performance.

      <title>Limited Ability of LLMs to Simulate Human Psychological Behaviours: a Psychometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The humanlike responses of large language models (LLMs) have prompted social scientists to investigate whether LLMs can be used to simulate human participants in experiments, opinion polls and surveys. Of central interest in this line of research has been mapping out the psychological profiles of LLMs by prompting them to respond to standardized questionnaires. The conflicting findings of this research are unsurprising given that mapping out underlying, or latent, traits from LLMs' text responses to questionnaires is no easy task. To address this, we use psychometrics, the science of psychological measurement. In this study, we prompt OpenAI's flagship models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to assume different personas and respond to a range of standardized measures of personality constructs. We used two kinds of persona descriptions: either generic (four or five random person descriptions) or specific (mostly demographics of actual humans from a large-scale human dataset). We found that the responses from GPT-4, but not GPT-3.5, using generic persona descriptions show promising, albeit not perfect, psychometric properties, similar to human norms, but the data from both LLMs when using specific demographic profiles, show poor psychometrics properties. We conclude that, currently, when LLMs are asked to simulate silicon personas, their responses are poor signals of potentially underlying latent traits. Thus, our work casts doubt on LLMs' ability to simulate individual-level human behaviour across multiple-choice question answering tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the generation of one-liner jokes through multi-step reasoning. Our work involved reconstructing the process behind creating humorous one-liners and developing a working prototype for humor generation. We conducted comprehensive experiments with human participants to evaluate our approach, comparing it with human-created jokes, zero-shot GPT-4 generated humor, and other baselines. The evaluation focused on the quality of humor produced, using human labeling as a benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that the multi-step reasoning approach consistently improves the quality of generated humor. We present the results and share the datasets used in our experiments, offering insights into enhancing humor generation with artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: Pursuit of honest and truthful decision-making is crucial for governance and accountability in democracies. However, people sometimes take different perspectives of what it means to be honest and how to pursue truthfulness. Here we explore a continuum of perspectives from evidence-based reasoning, rooted in ascertainable facts and data, at one end, to intuitive decisions that are driven by feelings and subjective interpretations, at the other. We analyze the linguistic traces of those contrasting perspectives in Congressional speeches from 1879 to 2022. We find that evidence-based language has continued to decline since the mid-1970s, together with a decline in legislative productivity. The decline was accompanied by increasing partisan polarization in Congress and rising income inequality in society. Results highlight the importance of evidence-based language in political decision-making.</description>

      <title>Tremor Reduction for Accessible Ray Based Interaction in VR Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07335</link>

Abstract: Comparative to conventional 2D interaction methods, virtual reality (VR) demonstrates an opportunity for unique interface and interaction design decisions. Currently, this poses a challenge when developing an accessible VR experience as existing interaction techniques may not be usable by all users. It was discovered that many traditional 2D interface interaction methods have been directly converted to work in a VR space with little alteration to the input mechanism, such as the use of a laser pointer designed to that of a traditional cursor. It is recognized that distanceindependent millimetres can support designers in developing interfaces that scale in virtual worlds. Relevantly, Fitts law states that as distance increases, user movements are increasingly slower and performed less accurately. In this paper we propose the use of a low pass filter, to normalize user input noise, alleviating fine motor requirements during ray-based interaction. A development study was conducted to understand the feasibility of implementing such a filter and explore its effects on end users experience. It demonstrates how an algorithm can provide an opportunity for a more accurate and consequently less frustrating experience by filtering and reducing involuntary hand tremors. Further discussion on existing VR design philosophies is also conducted, analysing evidence that supports multisensory feedback and psychological models. The completed study can be downloaded from GitHub.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Explainable AI Method Grad-CAM for Breath Classification on Newborn Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the digitalization of health care systems, artificial intelligence becomes more present in medicine. Especially machine learning shows great potential for complex tasks such as time series classification, usually at the cost of transparency and comprehensibility. This leads to a lack of trust by humans and thus hinders its active usage. Explainable artificial intelligence tries to close this gap by providing insight into the decision-making process, the actual usefulness of its different methods is however unclear. This paper proposes a user study based evaluation of the explanation method Grad-CAM with application to a neural network for the classification of breaths in time series neonatal ventilation data. We present the perceived usefulness of the explainability method by different stakeholders, exposing the difficulty to achieve actual transparency and the wish for more in-depth explanations by many of the participants.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Help Predict Elections? (Counter)Evidence from the World's Largest Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of how social media affects the formation of public opinion and its influence on political results has been a popular field of inquiry. However, current approaches frequently offer a limited comprehension of the complex political phenomena, yielding inconsistent outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new method: harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to examine social media data and forecast election outcomes. Our research diverges from traditional methodologies in two crucial respects. First, we utilize the sophisticated capabilities of foundational LLMs, which can comprehend the complex linguistic subtleties and contextual details present in social media data. Second, we focus on data from X (Twitter) in India to predict state assembly election outcomes. Our method entails sentiment analysis of election-related tweets through LLMs to forecast the actual election results, and we demonstrate the superiority of our LLM-based method against more traditional exit and opinion polls. Overall, our research offers valuable insights into the unique dynamics of Indian politics and the remarkable impact of social media in molding public attitudes within this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to its heterogeneity, the Biscari Archive, one of the most representative family's archives in Sicily, in a new digital historical study, became a valuable set of computable data that can lead historians to reconstruct the history of the city of Catania and Sicily. Ignazio Paterno' Castello and his wife Anna, princes of Biscari, were the promoters of the city's reconstruction after the 1693 earthquake, both politically and culturally. How could the digital historical methodology fulfil the traditional Historiography gap about how this noble family built its mighty? As we know, Humanities cannot easily be encapsulated in a few understandable numbers and names. However, historians, boosting Artificial Intelligence, such as Transkribus, and applying Historical Networks Analysis could help computers infer computable meaning from the digitised historical primary source. The Turing Machine became the most powerful tool to help historians understand what happened in the Past and identify the actors in cities and places' cultural and political renewal.</description>

      <title>"Here's Your Evidence": False Consensus in Public Twitter Discussions of COVID-19 Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brought about an extraordinary rate of scientific papers on the topic that were discussed among the general public, although often in biased or misinformed ways. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods analysis aimed at examining whether public discussions were commensurate with the scientific consensus on several COVID-19 issues. We estimate scientific consensus based on samples of abstracts from preprint servers and compare against the volume of public discussions on Twitter mentioning these papers. We find that anti-consensus posts and users, though overall less numerous than pro-consensus ones, are vastly over-represented on Twitter, thus producing a false consensus effect. This transpires with favorable papers being disproportionately amplified, along with an influx of new anti-consensus user sign-ups. Finally, our content analysis highlights that anti-consensus users misrepresent scientific findings or question scientists' integrity in their efforts to substantiate their claims.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Access is Insufficient for Rigorous AI Audits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: External audits of AI systems are increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for AI governance. The effectiveness of an audit, however, depends on the degree of access granted to auditors. Recent audits of state-of-the-art AI systems have primarily relied on black-box access, in which auditors can only query the system and observe its outputs. However, white-box access to the system's inner workings (e.g., weights, activations, gradients) allows an auditor to perform stronger attacks, more thoroughly interpret models, and conduct fine-tuning. Meanwhile, outside-the-box access to training and deployment information (e.g., methodology, code, documentation, data, deployment details, findings from internal evaluations) allows auditors to scrutinize the development process and design more targeted evaluations. In this paper, we examine the limitations of black-box audits and the advantages of white- and outside-the-box audits. We also discuss technical, physical, and legal safeguards for performing these audits with minimal security risks. Given that different forms of access can lead to very different levels of evaluation, we conclude that (1) transparency regarding the access and methods used by auditors is necessary to properly interpret audit results, and (2) white- and outside-the-box access allow for substantially more scrutiny than black-box access alone.</description>

      <title>A multidisciplinary framework for deconstructing bots' pluripotency in dualistic antagonism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anthropomorphic social bots are engineered to emulate human verbal communication and generate toxic or inflammatory content across social networking services (SNSs). Bot-disseminated misinformation could subtly yet profoundly reshape societal processes by complexly interweaving factors like repeated disinformation exposure, amplified political polarization, compromised indicators of democratic health, shifted perceptions of national identity, propagation of false social norms, and manipulation of collective memory over time. However, extrapolating bots' pluripotency across hybridized, multilingual, and heterogeneous media ecologies from isolated SNS analyses remains largely unknown, underscoring the need for a comprehensive framework to characterise bots' emergent risks to civic discourse. Here we propose an interdisciplinary framework to characterise bots' pluripotency, incorporating quantification of influence, network dynamics monitoring, and interlingual feature analysis. When applied to the geopolitical discourse around the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, results from interlanguage toxicity profiling and network analysis elucidated spatiotemporal trajectories of pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian human and bots across hybrid SNSs. Weaponized bots predominantly inhabited X, while human primarily populated Reddit in the social media warfare. This rigorous framework promises to elucidate interlingual homogeneity and heterogeneity in bots' pluripotent behaviours, revealing synergistic human-bot mechanisms underlying regimes of information manipulation, echo chamber formation, and collective memory manifestation in algorithmically structured societies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research explores the quickly changing field of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots in higher education, an industry that is undergoing major technological changes. AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, HuggingChat, and Google Bard, are becoming more and more common in a variety of sectors, including education. Their acceptance is still in its early phases, with a variety of prospects and obstacles. However, their potential in higher education is particularly noteworthy, providing lecturers and students with affordable, individualized support. Creating a comprehensive framework to aid the usage of generative AI chatbots in higher education institutions (HEIs) is the aim of this project. The Generative AI Chatbots Acceptance Model (GAICAM) is the result of this study's synthesis of elements from well-known frameworks, including the TAM, UTAUT2, TPB, and others along with variables like optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, insecurity, and others. Using a research method that encompasses a comprehensive analysis of extant literature from databases such as IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, the study aims to comprehend the implications of AI Chatbots on higher education and pinpoint critical elements for their efficacious implementation. Peer-reviewed English-language publications published between 2020 and 2023 with a focus on the use of AI chatbots in higher education were the main focus of the search criteria. The results demonstrate how much AI chatbots can do to improve student engagement, streamline the educational process, and support administrative and research duties. But there are also clear difficulties, such as unfavorable student sentiments, doubts about the veracity of material produced by AI, and unease and nervousness with new technologies.</description>

      <title>Inverse Scaling: When Bigger Isn't Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work on scaling laws has found that large language models (LMs) show predictable improvements to overall loss with increased scale (model size, training data, and compute). Here, we present evidence for the claim that LMs may show inverse scaling, or worse task performance with increased scale, e.g., due to flaws in the training objective and data. We present empirical evidence of inverse scaling on 11 datasets collected by running a public contest, the Inverse Scaling Prize, with a substantial prize pool. Through analysis of the datasets, along with other examples found in the literature, we identify four potential causes of inverse scaling: (i) preference to repeat memorized sequences over following in-context instructions, (ii) imitation of undesirable patterns in the training data, (iii) tasks containing an easy distractor task which LMs could focus on, rather than the harder real task, and (iv) correct but misleading few-shot demonstrations of the task. We release the winning datasets at https://inversescaling.com/data to allow for further investigation of inverse scaling. Our tasks have helped drive the discovery of U-shaped and inverted-U scaling trends, where an initial trend reverses, suggesting that scaling trends are less reliable at predicting the behavior of larger-scale models than previously understood. Overall, our results suggest that there are tasks for which increased model scale alone may not lead to progress, and that more careful thought needs to go into the data and objectives for training language models.</description>

      <title>How Prevalent is Gender Bias in ChatGPT? -- Exploring German and English ChatGPT Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the introduction of ChatGPT, OpenAI made large language models (LLM) accessible to users with limited IT expertise. However, users with no background in natural language processing (NLP) might lack a proper understanding of LLMs. Thus the awareness of their inherent limitations, and therefore will take the systems' output at face value. In this paper, we systematically analyse prompts and the generated responses to identify possible problematic issues with a special focus on gender biases, which users need to be aware of when processing the system's output. We explore how ChatGPT reacts in English and German if prompted to answer from a female, male, or neutral perspective. In an in-depth investigation, we examine selected prompts and analyse to what extent responses differ if the system is prompted several times in an identical way. On this basis, we show that ChatGPT is indeed useful for helping non-IT users draft texts for their daily work. However, it is absolutely crucial to thoroughly check the system's responses for biases as well as for syntactic and grammatical mistakes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Jungle of Bias: Political Bias Attribution in Language Models via Dependency Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked intense debate regarding the prevalence of bias in these models and its mitigation. Yet, as exemplified by both results on debiasing methods in the literature and reports of alignment-related defects from the wider community, bias remains a poorly understood topic despite its practical relevance. To enhance the understanding of the internal causes of bias, we analyse LLM bias through the lens of causal fairness analysis, which enables us to both comprehend the origins of bias and reason about its downstream consequences and mitigation. To operationalize this framework, we propose a prompt-based method for the extraction of confounding and mediating attributes which contribute to the LLM decision process. By applying Activity Dependency Networks (ADNs), we then analyse how these attributes influence an LLM's decision process. We apply our method to LLM ratings of argument quality in political debates. We find that the observed disparate treatment can at least in part be attributed to confounding and mitigating attributes and model misalignment, and discuss the consequences of our findings for human-AI alignment and bias mitigation. Our code and data are at https://github.com/david-jenny/LLM-Political-Study.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Feedback: Insights from Intelligent Tutoring Systems and the Learning Sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) focuses on the intersection of technology, education, and psychology, placing a strong emphasis on supporting learners' needs with compassion and understanding. The growing prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of scalable solutions within educational settings, including generating different types of feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, the approach to utilizing these models often involves directly formulating prompts to solicit specific information, lacking a solid theoretical foundation for prompt construction and empirical assessments of their impact on learning. This work advocates careful and caring AIED research by going through previous research on feedback generation in ITS, with emphasis on the theoretical frameworks they utilized and the efficacy of the corresponding design in empirical evaluations, and then suggesting opportunities to apply these evidence-based principles to the design, experiment, and evaluation phases of LLM-based feedback generation. The main contributions of this paper include: an avocation of applying more cautious, theoretically grounded methods in feedback generation in the era of generative AI; and practical suggestions on theory and evidence-based feedback design for LLM-powered ITS.</description>
