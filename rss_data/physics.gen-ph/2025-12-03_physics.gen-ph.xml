      <title>Massive Spin-2: Field-equations, Propagators, Massless-limit, and Perihelion Precessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the quantization of massive and massless spin-2 particles, using the auxiliary field method. The issue, the so-called vDVZ-discontinuity, whether the perihelion precessions for a massive graviton are in agreement with the data, is studied in the context of this spin-2 theory in tree-approximation. In the context of this setting, it is found, that a massive gravitation model with an imaginary scalar ghost, for a small graviton mass is compatible with the perihelion-precession of Mercury, etc..</description>

      <title>From Poincare Invariance to Gauge Theories: Yang-Mills and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is founded on two fundamental principles: the principle field equations introduced in Refs. \cite{S, S1, S2} and the Fock-Ivanenko covariant derivatives \cite{FI, F}. The former yields the equations of motion for free fields of arbitrary spin and helicity. In the massless case, it also dictates that Lorentz transformations for tensor fields acquire an additional term, which takes the form of a gauge transformation \cite{W, S1}.
  The latter principle, the Fock-Ivanenko derivative, introduces interactions based on the intrinsic and Poincar\'e groups. This framework allows us to recover a complete Yang-Mills theory, as well as general relativity in the connection-based formulations of Palatini and Ashtekar, both of which are theories with local gauge symmetries.
  While the standard approach begins with the symmetries of a matter action, we will instead derive dynamics directly from Poincar\'e invariance. This perspective reveals that for free fields, Lorentz invariance induces the gauge symmetry of massless tensors. A proper definition of these gauge transformations, in turn, requires the covariant derivatives provided by the Fock-Ivanenko approach.
  Considering matter fields, we derive the interacting Dirac equation in the presence of Yang-Mills and gravitational fields from its free counterpart.</description>

      <title>CP-violating non-linear electrodynamics and corrections to blackbody radiation thermal laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by ideas from effective field theories, we conduct a twofold investigation in CP-violating non-linear electrodynamics models. On the one hand, features related to field equations and wave propagation in the presence of a magnetic background field are evaluated. Interestingly, we show that the CP-violating term in our framework induces a bi-anisotropic behavior of the vacuum. On the other hand, blackbody radiation thermal laws in this situation are studied. Here, we provide a general formalism for photons at low temperature, namely, with $k_{B}T\ll{m_{e}c^{2}}$. The deviations from standard values of the thermodynamic quantities, such as energy, pressure, entropy, and specific heat, are discussed. In addition, we investigate the modifications in the Planck distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law induced by a non-trivial CP-violating parameter.</description>

      <title>Gravity and the Superposition Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between gravity and quantum mechanics is investigated in this work. The link is given by the wave packet expansion process, rooted from the Uncertainty Principle. The basic idea is to express the de Broglie wavelength used by Schrodinger for a massive particle in terms of the associated Compton wavelength which is replaced by the Michell-Laplace radius $Gm/c^{2}$ of the spherical object of mass $m\geq m_{P}$, where $m_{P}$ is the Planck mass. The wave packet spreading is studying in spherical coordinates, having the width $\sigma(t)$, expressed in terms of $G$ and $c$ instead of $\hbar$. Therefore, for masses larger than the Planck mass, a faster dispersion rate of $\sigma(t)$ is obtained, compared to the standard case. The dispersion of the wave packet is observed only by a free falling observer and the process breaks down once the observer hits the surface of the object. Different freely falling observers notice different rates of expansion of the wave packet and the source of gravity is in a quantum superposition. We further confront the Mita formula for the mean energy of the wave packet with the de Broglie-Bohm quantum potential energy when the Schrodinger equation is expressed in the Madelung form.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Brillouin's negentropy law of information and Landauer's law on data erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between information and energy introduces the observer and his knowledge into the understanding of a fundamental quantity of physics. Two approaches compete to account for this link, Brillouin's negentropy law of information and Landauer's law on data erasure, which are often confused. The first, based on the Clausius' inequality and Shannon's mathematical results is very robust, while the second, based on the simple idea that information needs a material embodiment (data-bits) is today perceived as more physical and prevails. In this paper, we show that Landauer's idea results from a confusion between information (a global emergent concept) and data (a local material object). This confusion leads to many inconsistencies and is incompatible with thermodynamics and information theory. The reason it prevails is interpreted to be due to a frequent tendency of materialism towards reductionism, neglecting emergence and seeking to eliminate the role of the observer. A paradoxical trend given that it is often accompanied by the materialist idea that all scientific knowledge nevertheless originates from observation. Information and entropy are actually emergent quantities introduced in the theory by convention.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Gravitational transformations in Electrochemistry and NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.09350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic transformation of the electrode potential has been derived to account for time dilation effects in electrode processes. This newly formulated Lorentz transformation is interpreted through the generation of spin-2 boson gravitons, originating from the fusion of spin-1 boson virtual photons, which subsequently escape into higher dimensions. Gravitational transformations of the electrode potential have also been derived, explaining the observed decrease in cell potential under stronger gravitational fields. The reduction in electrode potential near a gravitational source is attributed to a greater flux of gravitons escaping into higher dimensions in stronger gravitational fields compared to weaker ones. Similarly, the potential energy associated with the spin of magnetically active nuclei in an applied magnetic field, as observed in NMR spectroscopy, is shown to be Lorentz variant. This provides a mathematical demonstration that the Hamiltonian describing the energy of such nuclei is also Lorentz variant. The relativistic and gravitational transformations of both the electrode potential and the spin-related potential energy in magnetic fields are shown to be analogous.</description>

      <title>Universality of critical behaviors in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article gives a brief overview on recent advances in experiments of critical exponents in three groups of magnetic materials. Revisiting experimental data verifies that a universality class with the critical exponents beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4 and delta = 13/3 occurs in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising magnets, such as transition-metal intermetallics, rare-earth transition-metal compounds and manganites. Furthermore, the topological contributions to critical behaviors in the 3D Ising model are estimated by the difference between the exact solutions and the approximation values.</description>
