      <title>Probing the statistics of sequence-dependent DNA conformations in solution using SAXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SAXS studies of four 60 base-pair DNA duplexes with sequences closely
  related to part of the GAGE6 (G-antigen 6) promoter have been performed to
  study the role of DNA conformations in solution and their potential
  relationship to DNA-protein binding. We show that the SAXS data can be
  analysed using a simple polymer model which nevertheless quantitatively
  describes the average persistence length and torsional rigidity of the DNA
  double helix to determine the statistical distribution of local
  conformations of the DNA in solution to a high accuracy. Although the SAXS
  data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules,
  for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the
  conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows
  specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the
  DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the
  properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results
  are discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalising the Central Dogma as a cross-hierarchical principle of biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Dogma of molecular biology, as originally proposed by Crick, asserts that information passed into protein cannot flow back out. This principle has been interpreted as underpinning modern understandings of heredity and evolution, implying the unidirectionality of information flow from nucleic acids to proteins. Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central Dogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of information: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across generations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to facilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information. We argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a unifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of labour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular organisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a theoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution. Specifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma originates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary conflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma as an informational relationship between components of a system, this generalisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological hierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>A functional exchange shunt in the umbilical cord: the role of coiling in solute and heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The umbilical cord plays a critical role in delivering nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus through the umbilical vein, while the two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood with waste products back to the placenta. Although solute exchange in the placenta has been extensively studied, exchange within the cord tissue has not been investigated. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the coiled structure of the umbilical cord could strengthen diffusive coupling between the arteries and the vein, resulting in a functional shunt. We calculate the diffusion of solutes, such as oxygen, and heat in the umbilical cord to quantify how this shunt is affected by vascular configuration within the cord. We demonstrate that the shunt is enhanced by coiling and vessel proximity. Furthermore, our model predicts that typical vascular configurations of the human cord tend to minimise shunting, which could otherwise disrupt thermal regulation of the fetus. We also show that the exchange, amplified by coiling, can provide additional oxygen supply to the cord tissue surrounding the umbilical vessels.</description>
