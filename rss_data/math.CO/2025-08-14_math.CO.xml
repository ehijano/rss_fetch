      <title>Undecidability of Tiling the Plane with a Set of 5 Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a proof that it is undecidable whether a set of five polyominoes can tile the plane by translation. The proof involves a new method of labeling the edges of polyominoes, making it possible to assign whether two edges can match for any set of two edges chosen. This is achieved by dedicating 1 polyomino to the labeling process.</description>

      <title>Proximity and Radius in Outerplanar Graphs with Bounded Faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite, connected graph and $v$ a vertex of $G$. The average distance and the eccentricity of $v$ in $G$ are defined as the arithmetic mean and the maximum, respectively, of the distances from $v$ to all other vertices of $G$. The proximity of $G$ and the radius of $G$ are defined as the minimum of the average distances and the eccentricities over all vertices of $G$.
  In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the proximity of a $2$-connected outerplanar graphs in terms of order and maximum face length. This bound is sharp apart from a small additive constant.
  It is known that the radius of a maximal outerplanar graph is at most $\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor +1$. In the second part of this paper we show that this bound on the radius holds for a much larger subclass of outerplanar graphs, for all $2$-connected outerplanar graphs of order $n$ whose maximum face length does not exceed $\frac{n+2}{4}$.</description>

      <title>On Proximity and other Distance Parameters in Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. The average distance of a vertex $v$ of $G$ is the arithmetic mean of the distances from $v$ to all other vertices of $G$. The proximity and remoteness of $G$ are defined as the minimum and maximum, respectively, of the average distances of the vertices of $G$.
  It was shown by Aouchiche and Hansen [Proximity and remoteness in graphs: bounds and conjectures, Networks 58 no.\ 2 (2011)] that for a connected graph of order $n$, the difference between remoteness and proximity and the difference between radius and proximity are bounded from above by about $\frac{n}{4}$, and the difference between diameter and proximity is bounded from above by about $\frac{3}{4}n$.
  In this paper, we show that all three bounds can be improved significantly for maximal planar graphs, and for graphs of given connectivity.
  We show that in maximal planar graphs the above bound on the difference between radius and proximity can be improved to about $\frac{1}{12}n$, and further to about $\frac{1}{16}n$ and $\frac{1}{20}n$ if the graphs is, in addition, $4$-connected or $5$-connected, respectively. Similar improvements are shown for quadrangulations, and for maximal outerplanar graphs. We further show that the above bound on the difference between remoteness and proximity can be improved to about $\frac{1}{4\kappa}n$ if $G$ is $\kappa$-connected. Finally, we improve the bound on the difference between diameter and proximity to about $\frac{3}{4\kappa}n$ if $G$ is $\kappa$-connected. We present graphs that demonstrate that our bounds are either sharp, or sharp apart from an additive constant, even if restricted to planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Cutsets in ${\mathcal P}(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any set $X$, ${\mathcal P}(X)$ denotes the collection of all subsets of $X$, ordered by inclusion. A {\it cutset} in ${\mathcal P}(X)$ is a subset of ${\mathcal P}(X)$ which meets every maximal chain of ${\mathcal P}(X)$. A cutset is non-trivial if it does not contain $X$ or the empty set. Our main result is the following.
  Theorem 1: Let $X$ be an infinite set of cardinality $\kappa$. Every non-trivial cutset in ${\mathcal P}(X)$ contains a chain of cardinality $\kappa^+$ and an antichain of cardinality $2^{\kappa}$.</description>

      <title>The characteristic quasi-polynomials of hyperplane arrangements with actions of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an equivariant version of the characteristic quasi-polynomials as the permutation characters on the complement of mod $q$ hyperplane arrangements. We prove that the permutation character is a quasi-polynomial in $q$, and show that it can be expressed by the sum of the induced characters of an equivariant version of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. Furthermore, we consider the case of the Coxeter arrangements, and compute in detail for type $A_\ell$.</description>

      <title>The Challenge of Computing Geode Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a fascinating recent American Mathematical Monthly article, Norman Wildberger and Dean Rubine introduced a new kind of combinatorial numbers, that they aptly named the ``Geode numbers''. While their definition is simple, these numbers are surprisingly hard to compute, in general. While the two-dimensional case has a nice closed-form expression, that make them easy to compute, already the three-dimensional case poses major computational challenges that we do meet, combining experimental mathematics and the holonomic ansatz. Alas, things get really complicated in four and higher dimensions, and we are unable to efficiently compute, for example, the $1000$-th term of the four-dimensional diagonal Geode sequence. A donation of $100$ US dollars to the OEIS, in honor of the first person to compute this number, is offered.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Multilinear Invariants of a Finite Unitary Reflection Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space of multilinear invariants \( V_f \) of degree \( f \) for a specified finite unitary reflection group. A subspace \( W_f \) of typical invariants is also introduced. We note that the dimension of \( W_f \) is given by Catalan number. We explore both spaces for \( f \leq 5 \), noting that their dimensions differ based on the value of \( f \). We explicitly determine the bases for both spaces, and then we establish the relationship between the vectors of the two bases.</description>

      <title>Localization game capture time of trees and outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localization game is a variant of the game of Cops and Robber in which the robber is invisible and moves between adjacent vertices, but the cops can probe any $k$ vertices of the graph to obtain the distance between probed vertices and the robber. The localization number of a graph is the minimum $k$ needed for cops to be able to locate the robber in finite time. The localization capture time is the number of rounds needed for cops to win.
  The localization capture time conjecture claims that there exists a constant $C$ such that the localization number of every connected graph on $n$ vertices is at most $Cn$. While it is known that the conjecture holds for trees, in this paper we significantly improve the known upper bound for the localization capture time of trees. We also prove the conjecture for a subclass of outerplanar graphs and present a generalization of the localization game that appears useful for making further progress towards the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Maximal 1-plane graphs with the maximum number of crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A drawing of a graph in the plane is called 1-planar if each edge is crossed at most once. A graph together with a 1-planar drawing is a 1-plane graph. A 1-plane graph $G$ with exactly $4|V (G)|-8$ edges is called optimal. The crossing number $cr(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of crossings over all drawings of $G$. Czap and Hud\'{a}k proved that $cr(G)\le |V(G)|-2$ for any 1-plane graph $G$ and equality holds if $G$ is an optimal 1-plane graph [The Electronic J. Comb}., 20(2),#P54 (2013)]. This paper aims to characterize maximal 1-plane graphs $G$ achieving the maximum crossing number $|V(G)|-2$. We first introduce a class of quasi-optimal 1-plane graphs as a generalization of optimal 1-plane graphs, and then prove that for any maximal 1-plane graph $G$, $cr(G)=|V(G)|-2$ holds if and only if $G$ is a quasi-optimal 1-plane graph. Moreover, we prove that every quasi-optimal 1-plane graph is maximal 1-planar (not merely drawing-saturated). Finally, we present some applications of our main results, including a disproof of an upper bound on the crossing number of maximal 1-planar graphs with odd-degree vertices.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of triangles in $K_{1,s,t}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following generalized Tur\'an problem: For $2 \le s \le t$, what is the maximum number of triangles in a $K_{1,s,t}$-free graph on $n$ vertices? The previously best known lower and upper bounds are $\Omega(n^2)$ and $o(n^{3-1/s})$, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, all known proofs of the upper bound use the triangle removal lemma. We give a new elementary proof that avoids the use of the triangle removal lemma and improves the upper bound to $O\left(n^{3-1/s}(\log n)^{-1+1/s}\right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an exact formula for the probability that a uniformly random spanning tree of the $2$-by-$n$ square grid is ``balanced'' in the sense that it has an edge whose removal partitions its vertices into two sets of equal size. We compute the exact limit of this probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that, for a given $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $n$ vertices and edge density $d$, finds a complete $k$-partite subgraph of $H$ with parts of size at least ${c(d, k)(\log n)^{1/(k-1)}}$. This generalizes work by Mubayi and Tur\'{a}n on bipartite graphs. The value we obtain for the part size matches the order of magnitude guaranteed by the non-constructive proof due to Erd\H{o}s and is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called an integral graph when all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix are integers. We study which Cayley graphs over a nonabelian group $$ T_{8n}=\left\langle a,b\mid a^{2n}=b^8=e,a^n=b^4,b^{-1}ab=a^{-1} \right \rangle $$ are integral graphs. Based on the group representation theory, we first give the irreducible matrix representations and characters of $T_{8n}$. Then we give necessary and sufficient conditions for which Cayley graphs over $T_{8n}$ are integral graphs. As applications, we also characterize some families of connected integral Cayley graphs over $T_{8n}$.</description>

      <title>The domatic number game played on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domatic number of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint dominating sets admitted by the graph. We introduce a game based around this graph invariant. The domatic number game is played on a graph $G$ by two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns selecting a vertex and placing it into one of $k$ sets. Alice is trying to make each of these sets into a dominating set of $G$ while Bob's goal is to prevent this from being accomplished. The maximum $k$ for which Alice can achieve her goal when both players are playing optimal strategies, is called the game domatic number of $G$. There are two versions of the game and two resulting invariants depending on whether Alice or Bob is the first to play.
  We prove several upper bounds on these game domatic numbers of arbitrary graphs and find the exact values for several classes of graphs including trees, complete bipartite graphs, cycles and some narrow grid graphs. We pose several open problems concerning the effect of standard graph operations on the game domatic number as well as a vexing question related to the monotonicity of the number of sets available to Alice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic embedding constant (QEC) of a finite, simple, connected graph originated from the classical work of Schoenberg [Ann. of Math., 1935] and [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 1938] on Euclidean distance geometry. In this article, we study the QEC of graphs in terms of two graph operations: the Cartesian product and the join of graphs. We derive a general formula for the QEC of the join of an arbitrary graph with a regular graph and with a complete multipartite graph. We then provide quadratic embedding constants for the Cartesian product of an arbitrary graph $G$ with a complete graph and with a complete bipartite graph in terms of QEC$(G)$.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Lenstra flag universality for random matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $n \times n$ random integer matrices $M_1,\ldots,M_k$, the cokernels of the partial products $\mathrm{cok}(M_1 \cdots M_i), 1 \leq i \leq k$ naturally define a random flag of abelian $p$-groups. We prove that as $n \to \infty$, this flag converges universally, for any nondegenerate entry distribution, to the Cohen-Lenstra type measure which weights each flag inversely proportional to the size of its automorphism group. As a corollary, we prove universality of certain formulas for the limiting conditional distribution of $\mathrm{cok}(M_1M_2)$ given $\mathrm{cok}(M_1),\mathrm{cok}(M_2)$ in terms of Hall-Littlewood structure constants, which were previously obtained only for Haar matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Our proofs combine the general technology of Sawin-Wood, matrix product moment computations following those of Nguyen-Van Peski, and the computation done previously for Haar $p$-adic matrices by Huang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S = K[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ be the standard graded polynomial ring over a field $K$. In this paper, we address and completely solve two fundamental open questions in Commutative Algebra:
  (i) For which degrees $d$, does there exist a uniform combinatorial characterization of all squarefree monomial ideals in $S$ having $d$-linear resolutions?
  (ii) For which degrees $d$, does having a linear resolution coincide with having linear powers for all squarefree monomial ideals of $S$ generated in degree $d$?
  Let $\mathcal{I}_{n,d}(K)$ denote the class of squarefree monomial ideals of $S$ having a $d$-linear resolution. Our main result establishes the equivalence of the following conditions:
  (a) Any squarefree monomial ideal $I$ in $S$ generated in degree $d$ has a linear resolution, if and only if, $I$ has linear powers.
  (b) $\mathcal{I}_{n,d}(K)$ is independent of the base field $K$.
  (c) $d\in\{0,1,2,n{-}2,n{-}1,n\}$.
  In each of these degrees, we show that a squarefree monomial ideal has a linear resolution if and only if all of its powers admit linear quotients, and we combinatorially classify such ideals. In contrast, for each degree $3\le d\le n{-}3$, we construct fully-supported squarefree monomial ideals $I$ and $J$ in $S$ generated in degree $d$ such that the linear resolution property of $I$ depends on the choice of the base field, $J$ has a linear resolution and $J^2$ does not have a linear resolution.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Tree Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $n$-point metric space $(X,d_X)$, a tree cover $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of $|\mathcal{T}|=k$ trees on $X$ such that every pair of vertices in $X$ has a low-distortion path in one of the trees in $\mathcal{T}$. Tree covers have been playing a crucial role in graph algorithms for decades, and the research focus is the construction of tree covers with small size $k$ and distortion.
  When $k=1$, the best distortion is known to be $\Theta(n)$. For a constant $k\ge 2$, the best distortion upper bound is $\tilde O(n^{\frac 1 k})$ and the strongest lower bound is $\Omega(\log_k n)$, leaving a gap to be closed. In this paper, we improve the lower bound to $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}})$.
  Our proof is a novel analysis on a structurally simple grid-like graph, which utilizes some combinatorial fixed-point theorems. We believe that they will prove useful for analyzing other tree-like data structures as well.</description>

      <title>The bracket polynomial of the Celtic link shadow $CK_4^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Kauffman bracket polynomial for the shadow of the Celtic link $CK_4^{2n}$ using two complementary approaches. The first approach uses a recursive relation within the Celtic framework of Gross and Tucker, based on diagrammatic identities. The second approach makes use of a 4-tangle algebraic framework: a fundamental tangle is concatenated with itself n times to form an iterated composite tangle, and the Kauffman bracket polynomial is computed by decomposing the state space with respect to the basis elements of the 4-strand diagram monoid.</description>

      <title>Non-orientable regular hypermaps of arbitrary hyperbolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the consequences of residual finiteness of triangle groups is that for any given hyperbolic triple $(\ell,m,n)$ there exist infinitely many regular hypermaps of type $(\ell,m,n)$ on compact orientable surfaces. The same conclusion also follows from a classification of those finite quotients of hyperbolic triangle groups that are isomorphic to linear fractional groups over finite fields. A non-orientable analogue of this, that is, existence of regular hypermaps of a given hyperbolic type on {\em non-orientable} compact surfaces, appears to have been proved only for {\em maps}, which arise when one of the parameters $\ell,m,n$ is equal to $2$.
  In this paper we establish a non-orientable version of the above statement in full generality by proving the following much stronger assertion: for every hyperbolic triple $(\ell,m,n)$ there exists an infinite set of primes $p$ of positive Dirichlet density, such that (i) there exists a regular hypermap $\mathcal{H}$ of type $(\ell,m,n)$ on a compact non-orientable surface such that the automorphism group of $\mathcal{H}$ is isomorphic to $\PSL(2,p)$, and, moreover, (ii) the carrier compact surface of {\em every} regular hypermap of type $(\ell,m,n)$ with rotation group isomorphic to $\PSL(2,p)$ is necessarily non-orientable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$ and $I\subset S$ be a squarefree monomial ideal generated in degree $n-2$. Motivated by the remarkable behavior of the powers of $I$ when $I$ admits a linear resolution, as established in [10], in this work we investigate the algebraic and homological properties of $I$ and its powers. To this end, we introduce the complementary edge ideal of a finite simple graph $G$ as the ideal $$I_c(G)=((x_1\cdots x_n)/(x_ix_j):\{i,j\}\in E(G)) $$ of $S$, where $V(G)=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $E(G)$ is the edge set of $G$. By interpreting any squarefree monomial ideal $I$ generated in degree $n-2$ as the complementary edge ideal of a graph $G$, we establish a correspondence between algebraic invariants of $I$ and combinatorial properties of its underlying graph $G$. More precisely, we characterize sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein, nearly Gorenstein and matroidal complementary edge ideals. Moreover, we determine the regularity of powers of $I$ in terms of combinatorial invariants of the graph $G$ and obtain that $I^k$ has linear resolution or linear quotients for some $k$ (equivalently for all $k\geq 1$) if and only if $G$ has only one connected component with at least two vertices.</description>

      <title>Monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new graph-theoretic concept in the area of network monitoring. In this area, one wishes to monitor the vertices and/or the edges of a network (viewed as a graph) in order to detect and prevent failures. Inspired by two notions studied in the literature (edge-geodetic sets and distance-edge-monitoring sets), we define the notion of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set for short) of a graph $G$ as an edge-geodetic set $S\subseteq V(G)$ of $G$ (that is, every edge of $G$ lies on some shortest path between two vertices of $S$) with the additional property that for every edge $e$ of $G$, there is a vertex pair $x, y$ of $S$ such that $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $x$ and $y$. The motivation is that, if some edge $e$ is removed from the network (for example if it ceases to function), the monitoring probes $x$ and $y$ will detect the failure since the distance between them will increase.
  We explore the notion of MEG-sets by deriving the minimum size of a MEG-set for some basic graph classes (trees, cycles, unicyclic graphs, complete graphs, grids, hypercubes, corona products...) and we prove an upper bound using the feedback edge set of the graph.
  We also show that determining the smallest size of an MEG-set of a graph is NP-hard, even for graphs of maximum degree at most~9.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the bodyguard problem for graphs. This is a variation of Surrounding Cops and Robber but, in this model, a smallest possible group of bodyguards must surround the president and then maintain this protection indefinitely. We investigate some elementary bounds, then solve this problem for the infinite graph families of complete graphs, wheels, trees, cycles, complete multipartite graphs, and two-dimensional grids. We also examine the problem in more general Cartesian, strong, and lexicographic products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive recurrences and closed-form expressions for counting nonattacking placements of two types of chess pieces with unbounded straight-line moves, namely the bishop (two diagonal moves) and the anassa (one horizontal or vertical move and one diagonal move), placed on a standard square chessboard. Additionally, we obtain explicit expressions for the corresponding quasi-polynomial coefficients. The recurrences are derived by analyzing how nonattacking configurations attack a specific subset of board squares, employing a bijective argument to establish the relations. The main results are simplifications of known expressions for the bishop and a general counting formula for the anassa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two new contributions to the study of the independence polynomial $Z_G(z)$ of a finite simple graph $G = (V,E)$. First, we provide an improved lower bound for the zero-free region of $Z_G(z)$ for the important class of claw-free graphs. Our bound exceeds the classical Shearer radius and it is derived through a refined application of the Fern\'andez-Procacci criterion using properties of the local neighborhood structure in claw-free graphs. Second, we establish a novel combinatorial expression for $Z_G(z)$, inspired by the connection with the abstract polymer gas models in statistical mechanics, which offers a new structural interpretation of the polynomial and may be of independent interest. These results strengthen the connection between statistical physics, combinatorics, and graph theory, and suggest new approaches for analytic exploration.</description>

      <title>The support of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is an order ideal in the weak Bruhat order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integral weights $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a classical simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, Kostant's weight multiplicity formula gives the multiplicity of the weight $\mu$ in the irreducible representation with highest weight $\lambda$, which we denote by $m(\lambda,\mu)$. Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group of the Lie algebra whose terms are determined via a vector partition function. The Weyl alternation set $\mathcal{A}(\lambda,\mu)$ is the set of elements of the Weyl group that contribute nontrivially to the multiplicity $m(\lambda,\mu)$. In this article, we prove that Weyl alternation sets are order ideals in the weak Bruhat order of the corresponding Weyl group. Specializing to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$, we give a complete characterization of the Weyl alternation sets $\mathcal{A}(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root and $\mu$ is a negative root, answering a question of Harry posed in 2024. We also provide some enumerative results that pave the way for our future work, where we aim to prove Harry's conjecture that the $q$-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is $m_q(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)=q^{r+j-i+1}+q^{r+j-i}-q^{j-i+1}$ when $\mu=-(\alpha_i+\alpha_{i+1}+\cdots+\alpha_{j})$ is a negative root of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Random Fibonacci Words via Clone Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary (Fibonacci) words of 1's and 2's, graded by digit sum. Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549--568), we define clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ that generate random Fibonacci words of increasing length; unlike for the Young lattice (powered by the classical Schur functions), clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations -- parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. Second, we connect Fibonacci positivity with: (i) total positivity of tridiagonal matrices; (ii) Stieltjes moment sequences; (iii) the combinatorics of set partitions; and (iv) families of univariate orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme. We further link moment sequences of orthogonal polynomials to combinatorial structures on Fibonacci words, a connection that may be of independent interest. Third, we analyze scaling limits of the induced random words, obtaining stick-breaking-type limits (linked to GEM laws), new dependent stick-breaking limits, and limits supported on the discrete part of the Martin boundary of $\mathbb{YF}$. These results significantly extend the asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$ proved by Gnedin--Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), 433--446).
  Finally, we prove Cauchy-type identities for clone Schur functions with quadridiagonal-determinant right-hand side (in contrast to the product form for classical Schur functions), and construct models of random permutations and involutions from Fibonacci-positive specializations together with a Robinson--Schensted correspondence adapted to $\mathbb{YF}$.</description>

      <title>On the Two Paths Theorem and the Two Disjoint Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tuple (s1,t1,s2,t2) of vertices in a simple undirected graph is 2-linked when there are two vertex-disjoint paths respectively from s1 to t1 and s2 to t2. A graph is 2-linked when all such tuples are 2-linked. We give a new and simple proof of the ``two paths theorem'', a characterisation of edge-maximal graphs which are not 2-linked as webs: particular near triangulations filled with cliques. Our proof works by generalising the theorem, replacing the four vertices above by an arbitrary tuple; it does not require major theorems such as Kuratowski's or Menger's theorems. Instead it follows an inductive characterisation of generalised webs via parallel composition, a graph operation consisting in taking a disjoint union before identifying some pairs of vertices. We use the insights provided by this proof to design a simple O(nm) recursive algorithm for the ``two vertex-disjoint paths'' problem. This algorithm is constructive in that it returns either two disjoint paths, or an embedding of the input graph into a web.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Isomorphism Problems for Lattices from LCD Codes over Finite Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These days, post-quantum cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem has been proposed. Ducas-Gibbons introduced the hull attack, which solves the lattice isomorphism problem for lattices obtained by Construction A from an LCD code over a finite field. Using this attack, they showed that the lattice isomorphism problem for such lattices can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem with the trivial lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem. While the previous work by Ducas-Gibbons only considered lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite field}, this paper considers lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite ring} $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$, which is a more general case. In particular, when $k$ is odd, an odd prime power, or not divisible by $4$, we show that the lattice isomorphism problem can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Rings as unions of proper ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define and investigate ideal covering numbers of associative rings (not assumed to be commutative or unital): three invariants defined as the minimal number of proper left, right, or two-sided ideals whose union equals the ring. For every prime $p$, we construct four infinite families of rings without identity that attain the sharp lower bound $p + 1$ for ideal covering numbers, each exhibiting distinct behavior with respect to left, right, and two-sided ideal coverings. As a consequence of a result by Lucchini and Mar\'{o}ti, we also characterize all rings with ideal covering numbers three. Finally, we make several observations and propose open questions related to these invariants and the structure of rings admitting such ideal coverings.</description>
