      <title>Adjoint-Based Projections for Uncertainty Quantification near Stochastically Perturbed Limit Cycles and Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new boundary-value problem formulation for quantifying uncertainty induced by the presence of small Brownian noise near transversally stable periodic orbits (limit cycles) and quasiperiodic invariant tori of the deterministic dynamical systems obtained in the absence of noise. The formulation uses adjoints to construct a continuous family of transversal hyperplanes that are invariant under the linearized deterministic flow near the limit cycle or quasiperiodic invariant torus. The intersections with each hyperplane of stochastic trajectories that remain near the deterministic cycle or torus over intermediate times may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix can be obtained from the solution to the corresponding boundary-value problem. In the case of limit cycles, the analysis improves upon results in the literature through the explicit use of state-space projections, transversality constraints, and symmetry-breaking parameters that ensure uniqueness of the solution despite the lack of hyperbolicity along the limit cycle. These same innovations are then generalized to the case of a quasiperiodic invariant torus of arbitrary dimension. In each case, a closed-form solution to the covariance boundary-value problem is found in terms of a convergent series. The methodology is validated against the results of numerical integration for two examples of stochastically perturbed limit cycles and one example of a stochastically perturbed two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus. Finally, an implementation of the covariance boundary-value problem in the numerical continuation package coco is applied to analyze the small-noise limit near a two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in a nonlinear deterministic dynamical system in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that does not support closed-form analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Sundman-Sperling estimates for the restricted one-center-two-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, since the discovery of the figure-8 orbit by Chenciner and Montgomery, the variational method has became one of the most popular tools for constructing new solutions of the $N$-body problem and its extended problems. However, finding solutions to the restricted three-body problem, in particular, the two primaries form a collision Kepler system, remains a great difficulty. One of the major reasons is the essential differences between two-body collisions and three-body collisions.
  In this paper, we consider a similar three-body system with less difficulty, i.e. the restricted one-center-two-body system, that is involving a massless particle and a collision Kepler system with one body fixed. It is an intermediate system between the restricted three-body problem and the two-center problem. By an in-depth analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the minimizer, and an argument of critical and infliction points, we prove the Sundman-Sperling estimates near the three-body collision for the minimizers. With these estimates, we provide a class of collision-free solutions with prescribed boundary angles. Finally, under the extended collision Kepler system from Gordon, we constructed a family of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>Can points of bounded orbits surround points of unbounded orbits ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a somewhat surprising result: if $E$ is a disk in the plane $\mathbb R^2$, then there is a homeomorphism $h:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R^2$ such that, for every $x\in\partial E$, the orbit $O(x, h)$ is bounded, but for every $y\in {\rm Int}(E)$, the orbit $O(y, h)$ is doubly divergent. To prove this, we define a class of homeomorphisms on the square $[-1, 1]^2$, called normally rising homeomorphisms, and show that a normally rising homeomorphism can have very complex $\omega$-limit sets and $\alpha$-limt sets, though the homeomorphism itself looks very simple.</description>

      <title>Coboundaries and eigenvalues of morphic subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a morphic subshift as a subshift generated by the image of a substitution subshift by another substitution. In other words, it is the subshift associated with a ultimately periodic directive sequence. We present an efficient algorithm for computing eigenvalues of morphic subshifts using coboundaries. We show that continuous eigenvalues of S-adic subshifts for primitive directive sequences are always associated with some coboundary. For morphic subshifts, we provide a characterization of the dimension of the Q-vector space generated by eigenvalues. Additionally, if the substitutions are unimodular and without coboundaries, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for weak mixing of the subshift.</description>

      <title>Invariant manifolds in a reversible Hamiltonian system: the tentacle-like geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-parameter family of time-reversible Hamiltonian vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which has received great attention in the literature. On the one hand, it is due to the role it plays in the context of certain applications in the field of Physics or Engineering and, on the other hand, we especially highlight its relevance within the framework of generic unfoldings of the four-dimensional nilpotent singularity of codimension four.
  The system exhibits a bifocal equilibrium point for a range of parameter values. The associated two-dimensional invariant manifolds, stable and unstable, fold into the phase space in such a way that they produce intricate patterns. This entangled geometry has previously been called \textit{tentacular geometry}. We consider a three-dimensional level set containing the bifocal equilibrium point to gain insight into the folding behavior of these invariant manifolds. Our method consists of describing the traces left by invariant manifolds when crossing an invariant cross section by the reversibility map. With this new approach, we provide a better understanding of how tentacular geometry evolves with respect to the parameter.
  Our techniques enables us to link the tentacular geometry on the cross section with the study of cocooning cascades of homoclinic tangencies. Indeed, we present a general theory to extend to $\mathbb{R}^4$ the phenomena related to cocoon bifurcation that classically develop within families of three-dimensional reversible vector fields. On the basis of these results, we conjecture the existence of heteroclinic cycles consisting of two orbits connecting the bifocus with a saddle node periodic orbit.</description>

      <title>Stable coexistence in indefinitely large systems of competing species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra system is a set of ordinary differential equations describing growth of interacting ecological species. This model has gained renewed interest in the context of random interaction networks. One of the debated questions is understanding how the number of species in the system, $n$, influences the stability of the model. Robert May demonstrated that large systems become unstable, unless species-species interactions vanish. This outcome has frequently been interpreted as a universal phenomenon and summarised as "large systems are unstable". However, May's results were performed on a specific type of graphs (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi), whereas we explore a different class of networks and we show that the competitive Lotka-Volterra system maintains stability even in the limit of large $n$, despite non-vanishing interaction strength. We establish a lower bound on the interspecific interaction strength, formulated in terms of the maximum and minimum degrees of the ecological network, rather than being dependent upon the network's size. For values below this threshold, coexistence of all species is attained in the asymptotic limit. In other words, the outlier nodes with large degree cause instability, rather than the large number of species in the system. Our result refines May's bound, by showing that the type of network model is relevant and can lead to completely different results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some rigorous results on the absence of a wide class of invariant measures for dynamical systems possessing attractors. We then consider a generalization of the classical nonholonomic Suslov problem which shows how previous investigations of existence of invariant measures for nonholonomic systems should necessarily be extended beyond the class of measures with strictly positive $C^1$ densities if one wishes to determine dynamical obstructions to the presence of attractors.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of network dynamics from partial observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of time series from dynamical networks that are partially observed. In particular, we address the extent to which the time series at a node of the network can be successfully reconstructed when measuring from another node, or subset of nodes, corrupted by observational noise. We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first, and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Error Estimation in the Mean-Field Limit of Kinetic Flocking Models with Local Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative particle system characterized by moderate interactions, designed to accurately approximate kinetic flocking models that incorporate singular interaction forces and local alignment mechanisms. We establish the existence of weak solutions to the corresponding flocking equations and provide an error estimate for the mean-field limit. This is achieved through the regularization of singular forces and a nonlocal approximation strategy for local alignments. We show that, by selecting the regularization and localization parameters logarithmically with respect to the number of particles, the particle system effectively approximates the mean-field equation.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups.
  Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of CAT(-1) geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations. We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank.</description>

Abstract: We study surface subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(4,\mathbb R)$ acting convex cocompactly on $\mathbb R \textrm P^3$ with image in the coaffine group. The boundary of the convex core is stratified, and the one dimensional strata form a pair of bending laminations. We show that the bending data on each component consist of a convex $\mathbb R \textrm P^2$ structure and an affine measured lamination depending on the underlying convex projective structure on $S$ with (Hitchin) holonomy $\rho: \pi_1S \to \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$. We study the space $\mathcal {ML}^\rho(S)$ of bending data compatible with $\rho$ and prove that its projectivization is a sphere of dimension $6g-7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider word complexity and topological entropy for random substitution subshifts. In contrast to previous work, we do not assume that the underlying random substitution is compatible. We show that the subshift of a primitive random substitution has zero topological entropy if and only if it can be obtained as the subshift of a deterministic substitution, answering in the affirmative an open question of Rust and Spindeler. For constant length primitive random substitutions, we develop a systematic approach to calculating the topological entropy of the associated subshift. Further, we prove lower and upper bounds that hold even without primitivity. For subshifts of non-primitive random substitutions, we show that the complexity function can exhibit features not possible in the deterministic or primitive random setting, such as intermediate growth, and provide a partial classification of the permissible complexity functions for subshifts of constant length random substitutions.</description>

      <title>Rate and Bifurcation Induced Transitions in Asymptotically Slow-Fast Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a geometric approach to the study of bifurcation and rate induced transitions in a class of non-autonomous systems referred to herein as $\textit{asymptotically slow-fast systems}$, which may be viewed as 'intermediate' between the (smaller resp. larger) classes of asymptotically autonomous and non-autonomous systems. After showing that the relevant systems can be viewed as singular perturbations of a limiting system with a discontinuity in time, we develop an analytical framework for their analysis based on geometric blow-up techniques. We then provide sufficient conditions for the occurrence of bifurcation and rate induced transitions in low dimensions, as well as sufficient conditions for 'tracking' in arbitrary (finite) dimensions, i.e. the persistence of an attracting and normally hyperbolic manifold through the transitionary regime. The proofs rely on geometric blow-up, a variant of the Melnikov method which applies on non-compact domains, and general invariant manifold theory. The formalism is applicable in arbitrary (finite) dimensions, and for systems with forward and backward attractors characterised by non-trivial (i.e. non-constant) dependence on time. The results are demonstrated for low-dimensional applications.</description>

      <title>Positive steady states of a class of power law systems with independent decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power law systems have been studied extensively due to their wide-ranging applications, particularly in chemistry. In this work, we focus on power law systems that can be decomposed into stoichiometrically independent subsystems. We show that for such systems where the ranks of the augmented matrices containing the kinetic order vectors of the underlying subnetworks sum up to the rank of the augmented matrix containing the kinetic order vectors of the entire network, then the existence of the positive steady states of each stoichiometrically independent subsystem is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the positive steady states of the given power law system. We demonstrate the result through illustrative examples. One of which is a network of a carbon cycle model that satisfies the assumption, while the other network fails to meet the assumption. Finally, using the aforementioned result, we present a systematic method for deriving positive steady state parametrizations for the mentioned subclass of power law systems, which is a generalization of our recent method for mass action systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow, as shown by Sullivan and Otal-Peign\'e respectively. Moreover, it is strongly mixing by Babillot. We obtain a higher rank analogue of this theorem. Given a relatively Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group, there is a family of flow spaces parameterized by linear forms tangent to the growth indicator. We construct a reparameterization of each flow space by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning space of $\Gamma$ which has an exponentially expanding property along unstable foliations. Using this reparameterization, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure of each flow space is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy. Moreover, it is strongly mixing.</description>

      <title>An inverse theorem for the Gowers U^{s+1}[N]-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3998</link>
      <description>arXiv:1009.3998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the inverse conjecture for the Gowers U^{s+1}[N]-norm for all s &gt;= 3; this is new for s &gt; 3, and the cases s&lt;3 have also been previously established. More precisely, we establish that if f : [N] -&gt; [-1,1] is a function with || f ||_{U^{s+1}[N]} &gt; \delta then there is a bounded-complexity s-step nilsequence F(g(n)\Gamma) which correlates with f, where the bounds on the complexity and correlation depend only on s and \delta. From previous results, this conjecture implies the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuples conjecture for any linear system of finite complexity.

      <title>Scalable Computation of Energy Functions for Nonlinear Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear balanced truncation is a model order reduction technique that reduces the dimension of nonlinear systems in a manner that accounts for either open- or closed-loop observability and controllability aspects of the system. A computational challenges that has so far prevented its deployment on large-scale systems is that the energy functions required for characterization of controllability and observability are solutions of various high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-(Bellman) equations, which are computationally intractable in high dimensions. This work proposes a unifying and scalable approach to this challenge by considering a Taylor-series-based approximation to solve a class of parametrized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations that are at the core of nonlinear balancing. The value of a formulation parameter provides either open-loop balancing or a variety of closed-loop balancing options. To solve for the coefficients of Taylor-series approximations to the energy functions, the presented method derives a linear tensor system and heavily utilizes it to numerically solve structured linear systems with billions of unknowns. The strength and scalability of the algorithm is demonstrated on two semi-discretized partial differential equations, namely the Burgers and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of Crises in a Chaotically Forced Ocean Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupling of the Stommel box model and the Lorenz model, with the goal of investigating the so-called "crises" that are known to occur given sufficient forcing. In this context, a crisis is characterized as the destruction of a chaotic attractor under a critical forcing strength. We document the variety of chaotic attractors and crises possible in our model, focusing on the parameter region where the Lorenz model is always chaotic and where bistability exists in the Stommel box model. The chaotic saddle collisions that occur in a boundary crisis are visualized, with the chaotic saddle computed using the Saddle-Straddle Algorithm. We identify a novel sub-type of boundary crisis, namely a vanishing basin crisis. For forcing strength beyond the crisis, we demonstrate the possibility of a merging between the persisting chaotic attractor and either a chaotic transient or a ghost attractor depending on the type of boundary crisis. An investigation of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents around crisis levels of forcing reveals a convergence between two near-neutral exponents, particularly at points of a trajectory most sensitive to divergence. This points to loss of hyperbolicity associated with crisis occurrence. Finally, we generalize our findings by coupling the Stommel box model to other strange attractors and thereby show that the behaviours are quite generic and robust.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates for the Holonomy Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with Anosov geodesic flow, the problem of recovering a connection from the knowledge of traces of its holonomies along primitive closed geodesics is known as the holonomy inverse problem. In this paper, we prove H\"older type stability estimates for this inverse problem: 1) locally, near generic connections; 2) globally, for line bundles, and for vector bundles satisfying a certain low-rank assumption over negatively curved base $(M, g)$. The proofs are based on a combination of microlocal analysis along with a new non-Abelian approximate Livsic Theorem in hyperbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for integrated information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally developed as a theory of consciousness, integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to quantify the causal irreducibility of systems and subsets of units in the system. Specifically, mechanism integrated information quantifies how much of the causal powers of a subset of units in a state, also referred to as a mechanism, cannot be accounted for by its parts. If the causal powers of the mechanism can be fully explained by its parts, it is reducible and its integrated information is zero. Here, we study the upper bound of this measure and how it is achieved. We study mechanisms in isolation, groups of mechanisms, and groups of causal relations among mechanisms. We put forward new theoretical results that show mechanisms that share parts with each other cannot all achieve their maximum. We also introduce techniques to design systems that can maximize the integrated information of a subset of their mechanisms or relations. Our results can potentially be used to exploit the symmetries and constraints to reduce the computations significantly and to compare different connectivity profiles in terms of their maximal achievable integrated information.</description>

      <title>Learning spatio-temporal patterns with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a powerful combination of machine learning and mechanistic modelling. We train NCA to learn complex dynamics from time series of images and PDE trajectories. Our method is designed to identify underlying local rules that govern large scale dynamic emergent behaviours. Previous work on NCA focuses on learning rules that give stationary emergent structures. We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of Turing pattern formation in nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We demonstrate that NCA can generalise very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on model performance and stability. Being able to learn arbitrary dynamics gives NCA great potential as a data driven modelling framework, especially for modelling biological pattern formation.</description>

      <title>A master-slave coupling scheme for synchronization and parameter estimation in the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the constant parameters of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation from observed data has received attention from researchers in physics, applied mathematics and statistics. This is motivated by the various physical applications of the equation and, also, because it often serves as a test model for the study of space-time pattern formation. Remarkably, most existing inference techniques rely on statistical or machine learning tools, which are computationally very costly yet do not exploit the dynamical features of the system. In this paper we introduce a simple, online parameter estimation method that relies on the synchronization properties of the KS equation. In particular, we describe a master-slave setup where the slave model is driven by observations from the master system. The slave dynamics are data-driven and designed to continuously adapt the model parameters until identical synchronization with the master system is achieved. We provide a simple analysis that supports the proposed approach and also present and discuss the results of an extensive set of computer simulations. Our numerical study shows that the proposed method is computationally fast and also robust to initialization errors, observational noise and variations in the spatial resolution of the numerical scheme used to integrate the KS equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the results in the author's previous paper \cite{Usu22}, which deals with the quantitative problem on Littlewood's conjecture. We show that, for any $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$, any $(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ except on a set with Hausdorff dimension about $\sqrt{\gamma}$, any small $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ and any large $N\in\mathbb{N}$, the number of integers $n\in[1,N]$ such that $n\langle n\alpha\rangle\langle n\beta\rangle&lt;\varepsilon$ is greater than $\gamma(\log N)^2/(\log\log N)^2$ up to a universal constant.</description>

      <title>Pole Placement and Feedback Stabilization for Discrete Linear Ensemble Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete ensembles of linear, scalar control systems with single-inputs. Assuming that all the individual systems are unstable, we investigate whether there exist linear feedback control laws that can asymptotically stabilize the ensemble system. We provide necessary/sufficient conditions for feasibility of pole placement in the left half plane and for feedback stabilizability of the ensemble systems.</description>
