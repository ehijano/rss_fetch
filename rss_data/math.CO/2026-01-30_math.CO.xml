      <title>Maximizing subgraph counts in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we investigate the $d$-regular graphs $G$ with the highest $H$-density. We reframe the problem as a continuous optimization problem on the eigenvalues of $G$ by relating injective homomorphism numbers from $H$ and homomorphism numbers from quotient graphs of $H$. For almost all $H$, this relation has non-spectral terms, which require bounding by spectral terms in a way that is sharp at the optimal graph.
  For bipartite $H$ and $d$ large enough, we show $G$ consists of disjoint copies of $K_{d,d}$. For non-bipartite $H$ and $d$ sufficiently large, $G$ is a collection of disjoint $K_{d+1}$ graphs. For $H=C_5$ and $d=3$, disjoint Petersen graphs emerge.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of weight enumerators for codes generated by an integral matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of error-correcting codes, the minimum weight and the weight enumerator play a crucial role in evaluating the error-correcting capacity. In this paper, by viewing the weight enumerator as a quasi-polynomial, we reduce the calculation of the minimum weight to that of a code over a smaller integer residue ring. We also give a transformation formula between the Tutte quasi-polynomial and the weight enumerator. Furthermore, we compute the number of maximum weight codewords for the codes related to the matroids $N_k$ and $Z_k$. This is equivalent to computing the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the hyperplane arrangements related to $N_k$ and $Z_k$.</description>

      <title>Intersection statistics for antichains in minuscule posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite poset $P$, we study the expected size of the intersection of two independent uniformly random antichains. Equivalently, we evaluate the sum of $|A\cap A'|$ over all ordered pairs of antichains. For general posets this statistic appears to have little structure, but for the classical minuscule posets with uniform combinatorial models it admits closed-form expressions. Though the proofs are elementary and combinatorial, the resulting formulas admit a natural interpretation in terms of weight diagrams of minuscule representations.</description>

      <title>Comparability in Bruhat orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the sharp asymptotic scale of the probability that two uniformly random permutations are comparable in weak Bruhat order, showing that $\mathbb{P}(\sigma_1 \preceq_W \sigma_2)=\exp\Bigl(\bigl(-\tfrac12+o(1)\bigr)\,n\log n\Bigr)$. This significantly improves both of the best known bounds, due to Hammett and Pittel, which placed this probability between $\exp((-1+o(1))n\log n)$ and $\exp(-\Theta(n))$. We also improve the best known lower bound for strong Bruhat-order comparability, due to the same authors, by proving a subexponential lower bound. The Bruhat orders are natural partial orders on the symmetric group, appearing in wide-reaching settings including the geometry of flag manifolds, the representation theory of $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, and the combinatorics of the permutohedron. To analyze weak Bruhat order, we combine classic analytic, tableau-theoretic, and poset-theoretic tools, including the Plancherel measure and the RSK bijection. For strong Bruhat order we construct large families where members are comparable with high probability. Our proof that members are comparable combines the tableau criterion with an associated random-walk-type deviation process.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformations of the Tsetlin library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tsetlin library is a random shuffling process on permutations of $n$ letters, where each letter $i$ can be interpreted as a book; book $i$ is brought to the front of the bookshelf with an assigned probability $x_i$. We define a $q$-deformation of the Tsetlin library by replacing the symmetric group action on permutations by the action of the type $A$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We compute the stationary distribution and spectrum of this Markov chain by relating it to a Markov chain on complete flags over the finite field vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and applying techniques from semigroup theory. We also generalize the $q$-Tsetlin library to words (with repeated letters), and compute its stationary distribution and spectrum.</description>

      <title>Classifying integer hypertilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two objectives to this work: to classify all tame integer tilings and to classify all tame integer hypertilings. Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and J{\o}rgensen classified positive integer $\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons.
  The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs.</description>

      <title>Seymour's Second Neighbourhood Conjecture for Oriented Graphs of Order at Most Seven and Split-Twin Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $D$, let $N_1^+(v)$ denote the out-neighborhood of a vertex $v$, and let $N_2^+(v)$ be the set of vertices reachable from $v$ by a directed path of length two that are neither out-neighbors of $v$ nor equal to $v$. The Second Neighborhood Conjecture of Seymour asserts that every oriented graph contains a vertex $v$ with $|N_2^+(v)| \ge |N_1^+(v)|$. Equivalently, if one defines the second neighborhood invariant \[ \Delta(D)=\max_{v\in V(D)}\bigl(|N_2^+(v)|-|N_1^+(v)|\bigr), \] the conjecture asserts that $\Delta(D)\ge 0$ for all oriented graphs.
  We prove by exhaustive computation that $\Delta(D)\ge 0$ for every oriented graph on at most seven vertices. We also introduce a local graph operation, called a split--twin extension, and prove that it preserves the inequality $\Delta(D)\ge 0$. Consequently, $\Delta(D)\ge 0$ holds for infinite inductively generated families of oriented graphs.</description>

      <title>On minimal graphs for hamiltonian groups and their fixing set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite non-abelian group $H$ is hamiltonian if all of its subgroups are normal. We compute the minimal orders of graphs having a hamiltonian group as their automorphism group. The fixing number of a graph $\Gamma$ is the minimum cardinality of a subset $S$ of $V(\Gamma)$ such that the stabilizer of $S$ is trivial. For a given finite group $G$, the fixing set is defined as the set comprising all possible fixing numbers of graphs having group $G$ as their automorphism groups. We determine the fixing sets corresponding to finite hamiltonian groups.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Enumeration of Subclasses of Level-$2$ Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the enumeration of seven subclasses of level-$2$ phylogenetic networks under various planarity and structural constraints, including terminal planar, tree-child, and galled networks. We derive their exponential generating functions, recurrence relations, and asymptotic formulas. Specifically, we show that the number of networks of size $n$ in each class follows: \[ N_n \sim c \cdot n^{n-1} \cdot \gamma^n, \] where $c$ is a class-specific constant and $\gamma$ is the corresponding growth rate. Our results reveal that being terminal planar can significantly reduce the growth rate of general level-2 networks, but has only a minor effect on the growth rates of tree-child and galled level-2 networks. Notably, the growth rate of 3.83 for level-$2$ terminal planar galled tree-child networks is remarkably close to the rate of 2.94 for level-$1$ networks.</description>

      <title>On the minimum doubly resolving set problem in line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G$ with at least three vertices, let $d_G(u,v)$ denote the distance between vertices $u,v\in V(G)$. A subset $S\subseteq V$ is called a doubly resolving set (DRS) of $G$ if for any two distinct vertices $u, v \in V(G)$, there exists a pair $\{x,y\}\subseteq S$ such that $d_G(u,x)-d_G(u,y)\neq d_G(v,x)-d_G(v,y)$. This paper studies the minimum cardinality of a DRS in the line graph of $G$, denoted by $\Psi(L(G))$. First, we prove that computing $\Psi(L(G))$ is NP-hard, even when $G$ is a bipartite graph. Second, we establish that $\lceil \log_2 (1+\Delta(G))\rceil \le \Psi(L(G)) \le |V(G)| - 1$ holds for all $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G)$, and show that both inequalities are tight. Finally, we determine the exact value of $\Psi(L(G))$ provided $G$ is a tree.</description>

      <title>The sum-product problem for small sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness uniquely (up to scaling) exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</description>

      <title>Metric Approximations of Consistent Path Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A path system $\mathscr{P}$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $V$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is closed under subpaths. We say that a path system $\mathscr{P}$ is $\alpha$-metric if there exists a metric $\rho$ on $V$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{k}\rho(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \le \alpha \rho(x_0,x_k)$ for every path $(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_k)\in \mathscr{P}$. Also, we denote by $\Delta(\mathscr{P})$ the infimum of $\alpha$ for which $\mathscr{P}$ is $\alpha$-metric. We construct here infinitely many $n$-point consistent path systems $\mathscr{P}_n$ with $\Delta(\mathscr{P}_n) \ge n^{\frac{1}{2}-o(1)}$. We also show how to efficiently compute $\Delta(\mathscr{P})$ for a given path system.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic cycle partitions of $r$-edge-coloured graphs with high minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question posed independently by Letzter and Pokrovskiy asks: how many vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles are needed to cover the vertex set of an $r$-edge-coloured graph, as a function of its minimum (uncoloured) degree? We resolve this problem up to a $(\log r)$-factor. Specifically, we prove that, for any $r \geq 2$ and $\delta \in (0,1/2)$, any $n$-vertex $r$-edge-coloured graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq (1- \delta)n$ can be covered with $\mathcal{O}(r \log r \cdot \lceil r/\log(1/\delta)\rceil)$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles. We construct graphs that show this is tight up to the $(\log r)$-factor for all values of $r$ and $\delta$, and along the way disprove a conjecture of Bal and DeBiasio about monochromatic tree covering.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of regular $q$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite vector space $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$, the $q$-analogue of a graph, called a $q$-graph, is a pair $\Gamma=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of $1$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ and $\mathcal{E}$ is a subset of the $2$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Elements of $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are called vertices and edges, respectively. If the edges through a vertex $X$ consist of all $2$-spaces of a $(k+1)$-dimensional space which contain $X$, regardless of the choice of vertex, then $\Gamma$ is $k$-regular. Moreover, $\Gamma$ is flag-transitive if there is a subgroup of $\Gamma {\rm L}_n(q)$ preserving $\mathcal{E}$ and acting transitively on the set of all incident vertex-edge pairs; and symmetric if there is a subgroup of $\Gamma {\rm L}_n(q)$ preserving $\mathcal{E}$ and acting transitively on the set of all ordered pairs of adjacent vertices.
  This paper classifies all $k$-regular $q$-graphs that are either flag-transitive or symmetric. The $q$-graphs in the classification are constructed from familiar objects in finite geometry, including spreads, symplectic polar spaces, and generalised hexagons. The classification depends essentially on the classification of transitive linear groups, and thus ultimately on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Samplers: Typical and Worst Case Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the utility and limitations of using $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H = ([n], E)$ ($n \ge \mathrm{poly}(k)$) in the context of error reduction for randomized algorithms for decision problems with one- or two-sided error. Our error reduction idea is sampling a uniformly random hyperedge of $H$, and repeating the algorithm $k$ times using the hyperedge vertices as seeds. This is a general paradigm, which captures every pseudorandom method generating $k$ seeds without repetition. We show two results which imply a gap between the typical and the worst-case behavior of using $H$ for error-reduction.
  First, in the context of one-sided error reduction, if using a random hyperedge of $H$ decreases the error probability from $p$ to $p^k + \epsilon$, then $H$ cannot have too few edges, i.e., $|E| = \Omega(n k^{-1} \epsilon^{-1})$. Thus, the number of random bits needed for reducing the error from $p$ to $p^k + \epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\lg n+\lg(\epsilon^{-1})-\lg k+O(1)$. This is also true for hypergraphs of average uniformity $k$. Our result implies new lower bounds for dispersers and vertex-expanders.
  Second, if the vertex degrees are reasonably distributed, we show that in a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of the cases, choosing $k$ pseudorandom seeds using $H$ will reduce the error probability to at most $o(1)$ above the error probability of using $k$ IID seeds, for both algorithms with one- or two-sided error. Thus, despite our lower bound, for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of randomized algorithms (and inputs) for decision problems, the advantage of using IID samples over samples obtained from a uniformly random edge of a reasonable hypergraph is negligible. A similar statement holds true for randomized algorithms with two-sided error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish efficient algorithms for weakly-interacting quantum spin systems at arbitrary temperature. In particular, we obtain a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function and an efficient approximate sampling scheme for the thermal distribution over a classical spin space. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method and a standard reduction from approximate sampling to approximate counting.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solve this problem uses the classical random walks on the graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our procedure of community detection on a number of graphs and social networks, such as the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, dolphin's social network, etc.</description>

      <title>Real gamma distribution on analytic bundles of flag varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces four matrix normal distributions extending the separable covariance $ \varPhi \otimes \varPsi$ with potentially variable-level ($ \varPsi$) and/or sample-level ($ \varPhi$) correlations. The joint distribution of sample variances and covariances, leading to the product-moment distribution, is considered when precision matrices admit a specific tensor form. Several well-known results, including the non-central Wishart distribution and normal quadratic forms, now appear as corollaries. Moreover, we propose a conjecture concerning the analytic continuation of the real gamma distribution. By applying these results to the flag varieties, we classify the double flag and the single flag.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The log-concavity of cluster variables of type $A_n$ and cluster monomials of type $A_2$ was established by Chen-Huang-Sun. It is still a conjecture for the cluster monomials of higher rank. In this paper, we prove the log-concavity and unimodality of the cluster monomials of type $A_3$, a substantially more intricate case. Moreover, we refine and extend this conjecture by considering the unimodality and the strongly isomorphism of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of tropical Tevelev degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tropical Tevelev degrees arising from maps between certain tropical moduli spaces of curves. Building on work of Dawson and Cavalieri, who defined and computed tropical Tevelev degrees in the case of degree $d = g+1$ and $n = g+3$ marked points, we extend the theory by introducing an additional integer parameter $\ell$. In our framework the curve degree and number of marked points vary as $d = g + 1 + \ell$ and $n = g + 3 + 2\ell$, and we analyze the resulting tropical Tevelev degrees for both positive and negative values of $\ell$. This tropicalizes results of Cela, Pandharipande, and Schmitt on algebraic Tevelev degrees. We then further broaden the framework by introducing generalized tropical Tevelev degrees, providing the tropical counterpart to the generalized Tevelev degrees studied by Cela and Lian. These results establish a wider set of computational and structural patterns for intersection calculations on tropical moduli spaces and reveal new behavior beyond the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Character theoretic techniques for nonabelian partial difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda, \mu)$-partial difference set (PDS) is a subset $D$ of size $k$ of a group $G$ of order $v$ such that every nonidentity element $g$ of $G$ can be expressed in either $\lambda$ or $\mu$ different ways as a product $xy^{-1}$, $x, y \in D$, depending on whether or not $g$ is in $D$. If $D$ is inverse closed and $1 \notin D$, then the Cayley graph ${\rm Cay}(G,D)$ is a $(v,k,\lambda, \mu)$-strongly regular graph (SRG). PDSs have been studied extensively over the years, especially in abelian groups, where techniques from character theory have proven to be particularly effective. Recently, there has been considerable interest in studying PDSs in nonabelian groups, and the purpose of this paper is develop character theoretic techniques that apply in the nonabelian setting. We prove that analogues of character theoretic results of Ott about generalized quadrangles of order $s$ also hold in the general PDS setting, and we are able to use these techniques to compute the intersection of a putative PDS with the conjugacy classes of the parent group in many instances. With these techniques, we are able to prove the nonexistence of PDSs in numerous instances and provide severe restrictions in cases when such PDSs may still exist. Furthermore, we are able to use these techniques constructively, computing several examples of PDSs in nonabelian groups not previously recognized in the literature, including an infinite family of genuinely nonabelian PDSs associated to the block-regular Steiner triple systems originally studied by Clapham and related infinite families of genuinely nonabelian PDSs associated to the block-regular Steiner $2$-designs first studied by Wilson.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of relations on a level 5 module over the twisted affine Lie algebra $A_2^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <title>The non-backtracking transition probability matrix and its usage for node clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relation between the real eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix and those of the non-backtracking Laplacian is considered with respect to node clustering. For this purpose we use the real eigenvalues of the transition probability matrix (when the random walk goes through the oriented edges with the rule of ``not going back in the next step'') which have a linear relation to those of the non-backtracking Laplacian of Jost and Mulas. ``Inflation--deflation'' techniques are also developed for clustering the nodes of the non-backtracking graph. With further processing, it leads to the clustering of the nodes of the original graph, which usually comes from a sparse stochastic block model of Bordenave and Decelle.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new variant of variable-length source coding for sending a source over two parallel channels, one of which is costly and the other free. We give a complete solution to this problem. Next, we relate the problem to the number partitioning problem, which is the task of dividing a given list of numbers into a pre-specified number of subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is as nearly equal as possible. We introduce two new objective functions for this problem and show that an adapted version of the Huffman coding algorithm (with a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for input size $n$) produces the optimal solution for one objective function, and a nearly optimal solution for the other objective function.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish some new combinatorial properties of elements in Coxeter groups. Firstly, we generalise Reading's theorem on the canonical join representations of elements in finite Coxeter groups to all finitely generated Coxeter groups.
  Secondly, we show that for any element $x$ in a Coxeter group $W$ and root $\beta$ in its inversion set $\Phi(x)$, the set of elements $y \in W$ satisfying $\Phi(x) \cap \Phi(y) = \{ \beta \} $ is convex in the weak order and admits a unique minimal representative. This is strongly connected to determining the cone type of elements of $W$ and leads to efficient computational methods to determine whether arbitrary elements of $W$ have the same cone type.</description>

Applying this procedure iteratively produces an infinite family of triangles. Surprisingly, a classical result of Stynes (1980) shows that for any initial triangle, this infinite family falls into finitely many similarity classes.
  While the set of classes is finite, it turns out that a far smaller, stable subset of ``fat'' triangles effectively dominates the final mesh structure. We prove the following asymptotic area distribution result: for every initial triangle, the portion of area occupied by terminal quadruples tends to one, with the convergence occurring at an exponential rate. In fact, we provide the precise distribution of triangles in every step. We introduce the {\bf bisection graph} and use spectral methods to establish this result.
  Given this dominance, we provide a complete characterization of triangles possessing a single terminal quadruple, while conversely exhibiting a sequence of triangles with an unbounded number of terminal quadruples. Furthermore, we reveal several fundamental geometric properties of the points of a terminal quadruple, laying the groundwork for studying the geometric distribution of the entire orbit. Our analysis leverages the hyperbolic geometry framework of Perdomo and Plaza (2014) and refines their techniques.</description>
