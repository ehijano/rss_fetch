      <title>Optimal Experimental Design for Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations, or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested, which replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. These hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge such as first principles and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for the planning of experiments and generation of data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations which are easier to solve and which yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as an increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.</description>

      <title>Proximal random reshuffling under local Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study proximal random reshuffling for minimizing the sum of locally Lipschitz functions and a proper lower semicontinuous convex function without assuming coercivity or the existence of limit points. The algorithmic guarantees pertaining to near approximate stationarity rely on a new tracking lemma linking the iterates to trajectories of conservative fields. One of the novelties in the analysis consists in handling conservative fields with unbounded values.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Dubins Path on Sphere with Geographic Coordinates and Moving Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, two methods of addressing path planning for a Dubins vehicle moving on a sphere are considered, wherein either spherical coordinates or a moving frame are considered to describe the vehicle's motion. The primary contribution of this article is to show the equivalence of these two approaches, which in turn shows that the results known for the moving frame-based description transfer to the model utilizing spherical coordinates.</description>

      <title>Variational Analysis of Proximal Compositions and Integral Proximal Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes various variational properties of parametrized versions of two convexity-preserving constructs that were recently introduced in the literature: the proximal composition of a function and a linear operator, and the integral proximal mixture of arbitrary families of functions and linear operators. We study in particular convexity, Legendre conjugacy, differentiability, Moreau envelopes, coercivity, minimizers, recession functions, and perspective functions of these constructs, as well as their asymptotic behavior as the parameter varies. The special case of the proximal expectation of a family of functions is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Active vibration control of nonlinear flexible structures via reduction on spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large amplitude vibrations can cause hazards and failure to engineering structures. Active control has been an effective strategy to suppress vibrations, but it faces great challenges in the real-time control of nonlinear flexible structures. Here, we present a control design framework using reductions on aperiodic spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to address the challenges. We formulate high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems to suppress the vibrations and then use the SSM-based reductions to transform the original optimal control problems into low-dimensional linear optimal control problems. We further establish extended linear quadratic regulators to solve the reduced optimal control problems, paving the road for real-time active control of nonlinear flexible structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our control design framework via a suite of examples with increasing complexity, including a finite element model of an aircraft wing with more than 130,000 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>On the local and global minimizers of the smooth stress function in Euclidean Distance Matrix problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex minimization problem, with quartic objective function, that arises in the exact recovery of a configuration matrix $P\in \Rnd$ of $n$ points when a Euclidean distance matrix, \EDMp, is given with embedding dimension $d$. It is an open question in the literature under which conditions such a minimization problem admits a local nonglobal minimizer, \lngmp. We prove that all second order stationary points are global minimizers whenever $n \leq d + 1$. For $n &gt; d+1$, we numerically find a local nonglobal minimum and show analytically that there indeed exists a nearby \lngm for the underlying quartic minimization problem. Thus, we answer in the affirmative the previously open question about their existence. Our approach to finding the \lngm is novel in that we first exploit the translation and rotation invariance to reduce the size of the problem from $nd$ variables in $P$ to $(n-1)d - d(d-1)/2 = d(2n-d-1)/2$ variables. This allows for finding examples that satisfy the strict second order sufficient optimality conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast Unconstrained Optimization via Hessian Averaging and Adaptive Gradient Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimizing finite-sum and expectation objective functions via Hessian-averaging based subsampled Newton methods. These methods allow for gradient inexactness and have fixed per-iteration Hessian approximation costs. The recent work (Na et al. 2023) demonstrated that Hessian averaging can be utilized to achieve fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\tfrac{\log k}{k}}\right)$ local superlinear convergence for strongly convex functions in high probability, while maintaining fixed per-iteration Hessian costs. These methods, however, require gradient exactness and strong convexity, which poses challenges for their practical implementation. To address this concern we consider Hessian-averaged methods that allow gradient inexactness via norm condition based adaptive-sampling strategies. For the finite-sum problem we utilize deterministic sampling techniques which lead to global linear and sublinear convergence rates for strongly convex and nonconvex functions respectively. In this setting we are able to derive an improved deterministic local superlinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{k}\right)$. For the %expected risk expectation problem we utilize stochastic sampling techniques, and derive global linear and sublinear rates for strongly convex and nonconvex functions, as well as a $\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$ local superlinear convergence rate, all in expectation. We present novel analysis techniques that differ from the previous probabilistic results. Additionally, we propose scalable and efficient variations of these methods via diagonal approximations and derive the novel diagonally-averaged Newton (Dan) method for large-scale problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the Hessian averaging not only helps with convergence, but can lead to state-of-the-art performance on difficult problems such as CIFAR100 classification with ResNets.</description>

      <title>A Modeling Framework for Equitable Deployment of Energy Storage in Disadvantaged Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an analytical framework to incorporate the deployment of behind-the-meter energy storage coupled with rooftop solar, and their associated revenue streams, in the context of equitable energy policy interventions. We propose an extension to the Justice40 optimization model by adding storage and incorporating more realistic solar compensation mechanisms, such as net-billing, which allows for temporal revenue differentiation and the economic viability of behind-the-meter energy storage devices. The extended model includes household-level PV plus storage co-deployment alongside existing interventions, such as weatherization, rooftop PV only, community solar, and community wind. From a modeling perspective, we propose a novel approximation method to represent storage operations and revenue streams without expanding the temporal dimension of model, thus maintaining its computational efficiency. The proposed model is validated using a case study in Wayne County, Michigan, involving 3,651 energy insecure households.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Optimal Control Problems for Efficient Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with acados</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computationally efficient nonlinear model predictive control relies on elaborate discrete-time optimal control problem (OCP) formulations trading off accuracy with respect to the continuous-time problem and associated computational burden. Such formulations, however, are in general not easy to implement within specialized software frameworks tailored to numerical optimal control. This paper introduces a new multi-phase OCP interface for the open-source software acados allowing to conveniently formulate such problems and generate fast solvers that can be used for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). While multi-phase OCP (MOCP) formulations occur naturally in many applications, this work focuses on MOCP formulations that can be used to efficiently approximate standard continuous-time OCPs in the context of NMPC. To this end, the paper discusses advanced control parametrizations, such as closed-loop costing and piecewise polynomials with varying degree, as well as partial tightening and formulations that leverage models of different fidelity. An introductory example is presented to showcase the usability of the new interface. Finally, three numerical experiments demonstrate that NMPC controllers based on multi-phase formulations can efficiently trade-off computation time and control performance.</description>

      <title>Fading memory and the convolution theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several topological and analytical notions of continuity and fading memory for causal and time-invariant filters are introduced, and the relations between them are analysed. A significant generalization of the convolution theorem that establishes the equivalence between the fading memory property and the availability of convolution representations of linear filters is proved. This result extends a previous such characterization to a complete array of weighted norms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally, the main theorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can be characterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by the fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological notions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property. Finally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are Hilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading memory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and approximation results of solutions of kernel regressions in the presence of finite data sets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pickup-and-Delivery for Collaborative Platforms with Time-Dependent Travel and Crowdshipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pickup-and-delivery problem that arises when customers randomly submit requests over the course of a day from a choice of vendors on a collaborative e-commerce portal. Based on the attributes of a customer request, a dispatcher dynamically schedules the delivery service on either a dedicated vehicle or a crowdshipper, both of whom experience time dependent travel times. While dedicated vehicles are available throughout the day, the availability of crowdshippers is unknown a priori and they appear randomly for only portions of the day. With an objective of minimizing the sum of routing costs, piece-rate crowdshipper payments, and lateness charges, we model the uncertainty in request arrivals and crowdshipper appearances as a Markov decision process. To determine an action at each decision epoch, we employ a heuristic that partially destroys the existing routes and repairs them guided by a parameterized cost function approximation that accounts for the remaining temporal capacity of delivery vehicles. Through a set of computational experiments, we demonstrate the improvement of our approach over a myopic approach in several key performance metrics. In addition, we conduct computational experiments demonstrate the impact of inserting wait time in the route scheduling and the benefit of explicitly modeling time-dependent travel times. Through our computational testing, we also investigate the effect of demand management mechanisms that facilitate many-to-one request bundles or one-to-many request bundles on reducing the cost to service requests.</description>

      <title>Faster Stochastic Optimization with Arbitrary Delays via Asynchronous Mini-Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of asynchronous stochastic optimization, where an optimization algorithm makes updates based on stale stochastic gradients of the objective that are subject to an arbitrary (possibly adversarial) sequence of delays. We present a procedure which, for any given $q \in (0,1]$, transforms any standard stochastic first-order method to an asynchronous method with convergence guarantee depending on the $q$-quantile delay of the sequence. This approach leads to convergence rates of the form $O(\tau_q/qT+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for non-convex and $O(\tau_q^2/(q T)^2+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for convex smooth problems, where $\tau_q$ is the $q$-quantile delay, generalizing and improving on existing results that depend on the average delay. We further show a method that automatically adapts to all quantiles simultaneously, without any prior knowledge of the delays, achieving convergence rates of the form $O(\inf_{q} \tau_q/qT+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for non-convex and $O(\inf_{q} \tau_q^2/(q T)^2+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for convex smooth problems. Our technique is based on asynchronous mini-batching with a careful batch-size selection and filtering of stale gradients.</description>

      <title>Finite Dimensional Projections of HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of controlled interacting particle systems with common noise started in [W. Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. {\'{S}}wi{\k{e}}ch, \textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.} 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and A. {\'{S}}wi{\k{e}}ch, \textit{SIAM J. Control Optim.} 61 (2023), no. 2, 820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned works to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to the value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite dimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional assumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second main contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous (which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that optimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal controls of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a linear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the cost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space, thus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.</description>

      <title>Solving Truly Massive Budgeted Monotonic POMDPs with Oracle-Guided Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monotonic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where the system state progressively decreases until a restorative action is performed, can be used to model sequential repair problems effectively. This paper considers the problem of solving budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDPs, where a finite budget limits the maximal number of restorative actions. For a large number of components, solving such a POMDP using current methods is computationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space with an increasing number of components. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach. Since the individual components of a budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDP are only connected via the shared budget, we first approximate the optimal budget allocation among these components using an approximation of each component POMDP's optimal value function which is obtained through a random forest model. Subsequently, we introduce an oracle-guided meta-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve each of the independent budget-constrained single-component monotonic POMDPs. The oracle policy is obtained by performing value iteration on the corresponding monotonic Markov Decision Process (MDP). This two-step method provides scalability in solving truly massive multi-component monotonic POMDPs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we consider a real-world maintenance scenario that involves inspection and repair of an administrative building by a team of agents within a maintenance budget. Finally, we perform a computational complexity analysis for a varying number of components to show the scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Strategies for optimizing double-bracket quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently double-bracket quantum algorithms have been proposed as a way to compile circuits for approximating eigenstates. Physically, they consist of appropriately composing evolutions under an input Hamiltonian together with diagonal evolutions. Here, we present strategies to optimize the choice of the double-bracket evolutions to enhance the diagonalization efficiency. This can be done by finding optimal generators and durations of the evolutions. We present numerical results regarding the preparation of double-bracket iterations, both in ideal cases where the algorithm's setup provides analytical convergence guarantees and in more heuristic cases, where we use an adaptive and variational approach to optimize the generators of the evolutions. As an example, we discuss the efficacy of these optimization strategies when considering a spin-chain Hamiltonian as the target. To propose algorithms that can be executed starting today, fully aware of the limitations of the quantum technologies at our disposal, we finally present a selection of diagonal evolution parametrizations that can be directly compiled into CNOTs and single-qubit rotation gates. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this compilation and propose a way to take advantage of this approach when used in synergy with other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Cascade Operators and their Role in Linear Control, Estimation, and Model Reduction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain linear matrix operators arise naturally in systems analysis and design problems involving cascade interconnections of linear time-invariant systems, including problems of stabilization, estimation, and model order reduction. We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their relevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is then leveraged to delineate both known and new design methodologies for control, estimation, and model reduction. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic categorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for observation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear time-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for nonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly comprehensive nonlinear theory.</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Competing with the Top $\ell$ Items is Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel variant of the classical prophet inequality problem, where the values of a sequence of items are drawn i.i.d. from some distribution, and an online decision maker must select one item irrevocably. We establish that the competitive ratio between the expected optimal performance of the online decision maker compared to that of a prophet, who uses the average of the top $\ell$ items, must be greater than $\ell/c_{\ell}$, with $c_{\ell}$ the solution to an integral equation. We prove that this lower bound is larger than $1-1/(\exp(\ell)-1)$. This implies that the bound converges exponentially fast to $1$ as $\ell$ grows. In particular, the bound for $\ell=2$ is $2/c_{2} \approx 0.966$ which is much closer to $1$ than the classical bound of $0.745$ for $\ell=1$. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be extended to a more general scenario, where the decision maker is permitted to select $k$ items. This subsumes the $k$ multi-unit i.i.d. prophet problem and provides the current best asymptotic guarantees, as well as enables broader understanding in the more general framework. Finally, we prove a nearly tight competitive ratio when only static threshold policies are allowed.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Homotopy Method for Mathematical Programming Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.06984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a sequential homotopy method for the solution of mathematical programming problems formulated in abstract Hilbert spaces under the Guignard constraint qualification. The method is equivalent to performing projected backward Euler timestepping on a projected gradient/antigradient flow of the augmented Lagrangian. The projected backward Euler equations can be interpreted as the necessary optimality conditions of a primal-dual proximal regularization of the original problem. The regularized problems are always feasible, satisfy a strong constraint qualification guaranteeing uniqueness of Lagrange multipliers, yield unique primal solutions provided that the stepsize is sufficiently small, and can be solved by a continuation in the stepsize. We show that equilibria of the projected gradient/antigradient flow and critical points of the optimization problem are identical, provide sufficient conditions for the existence of global flow solutions, and show that critical points with emanating descent curves cannot be asymptotically stable equilibria of the projected gradient/antigradient flow, practically eradicating convergence to saddle points and maxima. The sequential homotopy method can be used to globalize any locally convergent optimization method that can be used in a homotopy framework. We demonstrate its efficiency for a class of highly nonlinear and badly conditioned control constrained elliptic optimal control problems with a semismooth Newton approach for the regularized subproblems. In contrast to the published article, this version contains a correction that the associate editor considers as too insignificant to justify publication in the journal.</description>

      <title>On the analysis of optimization with fixed-rank matrices: a quotient geometric view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a type of Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm, designed through Riemannian preconditioning, for optimization on $\mathcal{M}_k^{m\times n}$ -- the set of $m\times n$ real matrices with a fixed rank $k$. Our analysis is based on a quotient geometric view of $\mathcal{M}_k^{m\times n}$: by identifying this set with the quotient manifold of a two-term product space $\mathbb{R}_*^{m\times k}\times \mathbb{R}_*^{n\times k}$ of matrices with full column rank via matrix factorization, we find an explicit form for the update rule of the RGD algorithm, which leads to a novel approach to analysing their convergence behavior in rank-constrained optimization. We then deduce some interesting properties that reflect how RGD distinguishes from other matrix factorization algorithms such as those based on the Euclidean geometry. In particular, we show that the RGD algorithm is not only faster than Euclidean gradient descent but also does not rely on balancing techniques to ensure its efficiency while the latter does. We further show that this RGD algorithm is guaranteed to solve matrix sensing and matrix completion problems with linear convergence rate under the restricted positive definiteness property. Numerical experiments on matrix sensing and completion are provided to demonstrate these properties.</description>

      <title>Convergence Error Analysis of Reflected Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Globally Optimizing Non-Convex Constrained Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient Langevin dynamics and a variety of its variants have attracted increasing attention owing to their convergence towards the global optimal solution, initially in the unconstrained convex framework while recently even in convex constrained non-convex problems. In the present work, we extend those frameworks to non-convex problems on a non-convex feasible region with a global optimization algorithm built upon reflected gradient Langevin dynamics and derive its convergence rates. By effectively making use of its reflection at the boundary in combination with the probabilistic representation for the Poisson equation with the Neumann boundary condition, we present promising convergence rates, particularly faster than the existing one for convex constrained non-convex problems.</description>

Abstract: In the era of connected and automated mobility, commuters will possess strong computation power, enabling them to strategically make sequential travel choices over a planning horizon. This paper investigates the multiday traffic patterns that arise from such decision-making behavior. In doing so, we frame the commute problem as a mean-field Markov game and introduce a novel concept of multiday user equilibrium to capture the steady state of commuters' interactions. The proposed model is general and can be tailored to various travel choices such as route or departure time. We explore a range of properties of the multiday user equilibrium under mild conditions. The study reveals the fingerprint of user inertia on network flow patterns, causing between-day variations even at a steady state. Furthermore, our analysis establishes critical connections between the multiday user equilibrium and conventional Wardrop equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On $O(n)$ Algorithms for Projection onto the Top-$k$-sum Sublevel Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{top-$k$-sum} operator computes the sum of the largest $k$ components of a given vector. The Euclidean projection onto the top-$k$-sum sublevel set serves as a crucial subroutine in iterative methods to solve composite superquantile optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce a solver that implements two finite-termination algorithms to compute this projection. Both algorithms have $O(n)$ complexity of floating point operations when applied to a sorted $n$-dimensional input vector, where the absorbed constant is \emph{independent of $k$}. This stands in contrast to an existing grid-search-inspired method that has $O(k(n-k))$ complexity, a partition-based method with $O(n+D\log D)$ complexity, where $D\leq n$ is the number of distinct elements in the input vector, and a semismooth Newon method with a finite termination property but unspecified floating point complexity. The improvement of our methods over the first method is significant when $k$ is linearly dependent on $n$, which is frequently encountered in practical superquantile optimization applications. In instances where the input vector is unsorted, an additional cost is incurred to (partially) sort the vector, whereas a full sort of the input vector seems unavoidable for the other two methods. To reduce this cost, we further derive a rigorous procedure that leverages approximate sorting to compute the projection, which is particularly useful when solving a sequence of similar projection problems. Numerical results show that our methods solve problems of scale $n=10^7$ and $k=10^4$ within $0.05$ seconds, whereas the most competitive alternative, the semismooth Newton-based method, takes about $1$ second. The existing grid-search method and Gurobi's QP solver can take from minutes to hours.</description>

      <title>Error bounds, PL condition, and quadratic growth for weakly convex functions, and linear convergences of proximal point methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many practical optimization problems lack strong convexity. Fortunately, recent studies have revealed that first-order algorithms also enjoy linear convergences under various weaker regularity conditions. While the relationship among different conditions for convex and smooth functions is well-understood, it is not the case for the nonsmooth setting. In this paper, we go beyond convexity and smoothness, and clarify the connections among common regularity conditions in the class of weakly convex functions, including $\textit{strong convexity}$, $\textit{restricted secant inequality}$, $\textit{subdifferential error bound}$, $\textit{Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality}$, and $\textit{quadratic growth}$. In addition, using these regularity conditions, we present a simple and modular proof for the linear convergence of the proximal point method (PPM) for convex and weakly convex optimization problems. The linear convergence also holds when the subproblems of PPM are solved inexactly with a proper control of inexactness.</description>

      <title>Infinite time horizon stochastic recursive control problems with jumps: dynamic programming and stochastic verification theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying an infinite time horizon stochastic recursive control problem with jumps, where infinite time horizon stochastic differential equation and backward stochastic differential equation with jumps describe the state process and cost functional, respectively. For this, the first is to explore the wellposedness and regularity of these two equations in $L^p$-sense ($p\geq2$). By establishing the dynamic programming principle, we relate the value function of the control problem with integral-partial differential equation of HJB type in the sense of viscosity solutions. On the other hand, stochastic verification theorems are also studied to provide sufficient conditions to verify the optimality of the given admissible controls. Such a study is carried out in the framework of classical solutions but also in that of viscosity solutions. Our work emphasizes important differences from the approach for finite time horizon problems. In particular, we have to work in an $L^p$-setting for $p&gt;4$ in order to study the verification theorem in viscosity sense.</description>

Abstract: This paper is based on a crucial issue in the aviation world: how to optimize the trajectory and controls given to the aircraft in order to optimize flight time and fuel consumption. This study aims to provide elements of a response to this problem and to define, under certain simplifying assumptions, an optimal response, using Constrained Finite Time Optimal Control(CFTOC). The first step is to define the dynamic model of the aircraft in accordance with the controllable inputs and wind disturbances. Then we will identify a precise objective in terms of optimization and implement an optimization program to solve it under the circumstances of simulated real flight situation. Finally, the optimization result is validated and discussed by different scenarios.</description>

Abstract: A trolley is a container for loading printed circuit board (PCB) components, and a trolley optimisation problem (TOP) is an assignment of PCB components to trolleys for use in the production of a set of PCBs in an assembly line. In this paper, we introduce the TOP, a novel operation research application. To formulate the TOP, we derive a novel extension of the bin packing problem. We exploit the problem structure to decompose the TOP into two smaller, identical, and independent problems. Further, we develop a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the TOP and prove that the TOP is an NP-complete problem. A case study of an aerospace manufacturing company is used to illustrate the TOP which successfully automated the manual process in the company and resulted in significant cost reductions and flexibility in the building process.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Curing and Network Design in SIS Epidemic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies efficient algorithms for dynamic curing policies and the corresponding network design problems to guarantee the fast extinction of epidemic spread in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. We consider a Markov process-based SIS epidemic model. We provide a computationally efficient curing algorithm based on the curing policy proposed by Drakopoulos, Ozdaglar, and Tsitsiklis (2014). Since the corresponding optimization problem is NP-hard, finding optimal policies is intractable for large graphs. We provide approximation guarantees on the curing budget of the proposed dynamic curing algorithm. We also present a curing algorithm fair to demographic groups.
  When the total infection rate is high, the original curing policy includes a waiting period in which no measure is taken to mitigate the spread until the rate slows down. To avoid the waiting period, we study network design problems to reduce the total infection rate by deleting edges or reducing the weight of edges. Then the curing processes become continuous since the total infection rate is restricted by network design. We provide algorithms with provable guarantees for the considered network design problems. In summary, the proposed curing and network design algorithms together provide an effective and computationally efficient approach that mitigates SIS epidemic spread in networks.</description>

      <title>Online Uniform Allocation:Randomized Learning-Augmented Approximation Algorithms with Application to Digital Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01995v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in digital health, this work studies the novel problem of online uniform allocation (OUA), where the goal is to distribute a budget uniformly across unknown decision times. In the OUA problem, the algorithm is given a budget $b$ and a time horizon $T$, and an adversary then chooses a value $\tau^* \in [b,T]$, which is revealed to the algorithm online. At each decision time $i \in [\tau^*]$, the algorithm must determine a probability that maximizes the budget spent throughout the horizon, respecting budget constraint $b$, while achieving as uniform a distribution as possible over $\tau^*$. We present the first randomized algorithm designed for this problem and subsequently extend it to incorporate learning augmentation. We provide worst-case approximation guarantees for both algorithms, and illustrate the utility of the algorithms through both synthetic experiments and a real-world case study involving the HeartSteps mobile application. Our numerical results show strong empirical average performance of our proposed randomized algorithms against previously proposed heuristic solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Savings and Value of Population in A Stochastic Environment: Transient Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the work on optimal investment and consumption of a population considered in [2] to a general stochastic setting over a finite time horizon. We incorporate the Cobb-Douglas production function in the capital dynamics while the consumption utility function and the drift rate in the population dynamics can be general, in contrast with [2, 30, 31]. The dynamic programming formulation yields an unconventional nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, in which the Cobb-Douglas production function as the coefficient of the gradient of the value function induces the mismatching of power rates between capital and population. Moreover, the equation has a very singular term, essentially a very negative power of the partial derivative of the value function with respect to the capital, coming from the optimization of control, and their resolution turns out to be a complex problem not amenable to classical analysis. To show that this singular term, which has not been studied in any physical systems yet, does not actually blow up, we establish new pointwise generalized power laws for the partial derivative of the value function. Our contribution lies in providing a theoretical treatment that combines both the probabilistic approach and theory of partial differential equations to derive the pointwise upper and lower bounds as well as energy estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces. By then, we accomplish showing the well-posedness of classical solutions to a non-canonical parabolic equation arising from a long-lasting problem in macroeconomics.</description>
