      <title>The Rise of Recommerce: Ownership and Sustainability with Overlapping Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the branded recommerce channel - digitally enabled and branded marketplaces that facilitate purchasing pre-owned items directly from a manufacturer's e-commerce site - leads to new variants of classic IS and economic questions relating to secondary markets. Such branded recommerce is increasingly platform-enabled, creating opportunities for greater sustainability and stronger brand experience control but posing a greater risk of cannibalization of the sales of new items. We model the effects that the sales of pre-owned items have on market segmentation and product durability choices for a monopolist facing heterogeneous customers, contrasting outcomes when the trade of pre-owned goods takes place through a third-party marketplace with outcomes under branded recommerce. We show that the direct revenue benefits of branded recommerce are not their primary source of value to the monopolist, and rather, there are three indirect effects that alter profits and sustainability. Product durability increases, a seller finds it optimal to forgo marketplace fees altogether, and there are greater seller incentives to lower the quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items. We establish these results for a simple two-period model as well as developing a new infinite horizon model with overlapping generations. Our paper sheds new insight into this emerging digital channel phenomenon, underscoring the importance of recommerce platforms in aligning seller profits with sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Automation in Technical Customer Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in transforming technical customer service (TCS) through the automation of cognitive tasks. Design/Methodology/Approach: Using a prototyping approach, the research assesses the feasibility of automating cognitive tasks in TCS with LLMs, employing real-world technical incident data from a Swiss telecommunications operator. Findings: Lower-level cognitive tasks such as translation, summarization, and content generation can be effectively automated with LLMs like GPT-4, while higher-level tasks such as reasoning require more advanced technological approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or finetuning ; furthermore, the study underscores the significance of data ecosystems in enabling more complex cognitive tasks by fostering data sharing among various actors involved. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the emerging theory on LLM potential and technical feasibility in service management, providing concrete insights for operators of TCS units and highlighting the need for further research to address limitations and validate the applicability of LLMs across different domains.</description>

      <title>LLM Voting: Human Choices and AI Collective Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the methods used for voting input and the presentation of choices influence LLM voting behavior. We discovered that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the importance of cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.</description>
