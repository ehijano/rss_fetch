      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, and the locations of the two peaks are sensitive to the maximum value of $J_{\rm{sym}}$ reflecting the stiffness of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ above about 3 times the saturation density $\rho_0$ of SNM, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around $(2-3)\rho_0$.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Determination of the strong coupling constant and the Collins-Soper kernel from the energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform, for the first time, a simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel in the back-to-back limit of energy-energy correlators in $e^+ e^-$ collisions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy. Our extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is consistent with the world average and has comparable accuracy. For the nonperturbative part of the CS kernel, we consider two different parameterizations, and the results align with those obtained from phenomenological fits of the transverse-momentum-dependent differential cross section in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan production.</description>

      <title>Chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>ALICE Upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE collaboration prepares multiple upgrades to further extend the reach of heavy-ion physics at the LHC. For LHC Run 4 (2030-2033), a Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) system combines a high-granularity electromagnetic silicon-tungsten calorimeter with a conventional hadronic calorimeter leading to an excellent two-shower separation for neutral pion reconstruction and photon isolation. Direct photon measurements with FoCal will uniquely constrain the low-x gluon structure of protons and nuclei via forward measurements of direct photons. Additionally, ALICE will employ bent, wafer-scale pixel sensors achieving truly cylindrical tracking layers with very low material budget. These layers will replace the three innermost layers of the Inner Tracking System resulting in an improvement in pointing resolution allowing new measurements of heavy-flavour hadrons and dielectrons.
  For Run 5 and beyond, a next-generation detector system, ALICE 3, has been conceived to gain unique access to the interaction and thermalization of heavy flavour probes in the QGP as well as to the thermal radiation carrying information about the temperature and the restoration of chiral symmetry. At its core, it combines a high-resolution vertex detector with a large-acceptance silicon pixel tracker. For the identification of particles, a combination of a time-of-flight system, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a muon identifier, and a dedicated forward detector for ultra-soft photons, are envisaged.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a probe of hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton's parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions that has been experimentally confirmed. In this letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider and find good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of the quantum entanglement framework in the experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a dibaryon spectrum in coherent $\pi^0\pi^0 d$ photoproduction at forward deuteron angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent reaction, $\gamma d \rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0 d$ was studied with the BGOOD experiment at ELSA from threshold to a centre-of-mass energy of 2850\,MeV. A full kinematic reconstruction was made, with final state deuterons identified in the forward spectrometer and $\pi^0$ decays in the central BGO Rugby Ball. The strength of the differential cross section exceeds what can be described by models of coherent photoproduction and instead supports the three isoscalar dibaryon candidates reported by the ELPH collaboration at 2.38, 2.47 and 2.63\,GeV/c$^2$. A low mass enhancement in the $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant mass is also observed at the $d^*(2380)$ centre-of-mass energy which is consistent with the ABC effect. At higher centre-of-mass energies, a narrow peak in the $\pi^0 d$ invariant mass at 2114\,MeV/c$^2$ with a width of 20\,MeV/c$^2$ supports a sequential two-dibaryon decay mechanism.</description>

      <title>$K^+\Lambda(1520)$ photoproduction at forward angles near threshold with the BGOOD experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The differential cross section for $\gamma p\rightarrow K^+\Lambda(1520)$ was measured from threshold to a centre-of-mass energy of 2090\,MeV at forward angles at the BGOOD experiment. The high statistical precision and resolution in centre-of-mass energy and angle allows a detailed characterisation of this low-momentum transfer kinematic region. The data agree with a previous LEPS measurement and support effective Lagrangian models that indicate that the contact term dominates the cross section near threshold.</description>

      <title>Dihadron helicity correlation in photon-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The helicity correlation of two back-to-back hadrons is a powerful tool that makes it possible to probe the longitudinal spin transfer, $G_{1L}$, in unpolarized hadronic collisions. In this work, we investigate the helicity correlation of back-to-back dihadrons produced in photon-nucleus collisions with both space-like and quasireal photons and explore its potential in understanding the flavor dependence of spin-dependent fragmentation functions. We present helicity amplitudes of partonic scatterings with both virtual and real photons and make numerical predictions for the dihadron helicity correlations at the future Electron Ion Collider experiment and the current RHIC/LHC ultra-peripheral collision experiment. Future experimental measurements can also illuminate the fragmentation function of circularly polarized gluons.</description>

      <title>Net-Proton Number Cumulants in Strongly and Weakly Coupled QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the $\textit{dynamical soft-wall}$ AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) dominated by gluons in the large $N_c$ limit. We identify a critical point at $\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}$ or $\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}$ in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP), for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$, dominated by valence quarks. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>
