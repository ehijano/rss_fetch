      <title>Maximal number of subword occurrences in a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations</description>

      <title>On semi-transitive orientability of circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be word-representable if a word $w$ can be formed using the letters of the alphabet $V$ such that for every pair of vertices $x$ and $y$, $xy \in E$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. A \textit{semi-transitive} orientation is an acyclic directed graph where for any directed path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow v_m$, $m \ge 2$ either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$ or for all $1 \le i &lt; j \le m$ there is an arc between $v_i$ and $v_j$. An undirected graph is semi-transitive if it admits a semi-transitive orientation. For given positive integers $n, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$, we consider the undirected circulant graph with set of vertices $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ and the set of edges$\{ij ~ | ~ (i - j) \pmod n$ or $(j-i) \pmod n$ are in $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\}\}$, where $ 0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; a_k &lt; (n+1)/2$. Recently, Kitaev and Pyatkin have shown that every $4$-regular circulant graph is semi-transitive. Further, they have posed an open problem regarding the semi-transitive orientability of circulant graphs for which the elements of the set $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\}$ are consecutive positive integers.
  In this paper, we solve the problem mentioned above. In addition, we show that under certain assumptions, some $k(\ge5)$-regular circulant graphs are semi-transitive, and some are not. Moreover, since a semi-transitive orientation is a characterisation of word-representability, we give some upper bound for the representation number of certain $k$-regular circulant graphs.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sets in Triangle-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of vertices is $k$-sparse if it induces a graph with a maximum degree of at most $k$. In this missive, we consider the order of the largest $k$-sparse set in a triangle-free graph of fixed order. We show, for example, that every triangle-free graph of order 11 contains a 1-sparse 5-set; every triangle-free graph of order 13 contains a 2-sparse 7-set; and every triangle-free graph of order 8 contains a 3-sparse 6-set. Further, these are all best possible.
  For fixed $k$, we consider the growth rate of the largest $k$-sparse set of a triangle-free graph of order $n$. Also, we consider Ramsey numbers of the following type. Given $i$, what is the smallest $n$ having the property that all triangle-free graphs of order $n$ contain a 4-cycle or a $k$-sparse set of order $i$. We use both direct proof techniques and an efficient graph enumeration algorithm to obtain several values for defective Ramsey numbers and a parameter related to largest sparse sets in triangle-free graphs, along with their extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is an $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Future Directions in the Theory of Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</description>
