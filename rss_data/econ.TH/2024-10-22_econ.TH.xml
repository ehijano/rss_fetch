      <title>Analysis of short-run and long-run marginal costs of generation in the power market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In power markets, understanding the cost dynamics of electricity generation is crucial. The complexity of price formation in the power system arises from its diverse attributes, such as various generator types, each characterized by its specific fixed and variable costs as well as different lifetimes. In this paper, we adopt an approach that investigates both long-run marginal cost (LRMC) and short-run marginal cost (SRMC) in a perfect competition market. According to economic theory, marginal pricing serves as an effective method for determining the generation cost of electricity. This paper presents a capacity expansion model designed to evaluate the marginal cost of electricity generation, encompassing both long-term and short-term perspectives. Following a parametric analysis and the calculation of LRMCs, this study investigates the allocation of investment costs across various time periods and how these costs factor into the LRMC to ensure cost recovery. Additionally, an exploration of SRMCs reveals the conditions under which LRMCs and SRMCs converge or diverge. We observe that when there is a disparity between LRMC and SRMC, setting electricity generation prices equal to SRMCs does not ensure the complete recovery of investment and operational costs. This phenomenon holds implications for market reliability and challenges the pricing strategies that rely solely on SRMCs. Furthermore, our investigation highlighted the significance of addressing degeneracy in the power market modeling. Primal degeneracy in the SRMC model can result in multiple values for the dual variable representing SRMC. This multiplicity of values creates ambiguity regarding the precise SRMC value, making it challenging to ascertain the correct estimation. As a result, resolving degeneracy will ensure the reliability of the SRMC value, consequently enhancing the robustness and credibility of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Feedback strategies in the market with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how dynamic entry deterrence operates through feedback strategies in markets experiencing stochastic demand fluctuations. The incumbent firm, aware of its own cost structure, can deter a potential competitor by strategically adjusting prices. The potential entrant faces a one-time, irreversible decision to enter the market, incurring a fixed cost, with profits determined by market conditions and the incumbent's hidden type. Market demand follows a Chan-Karolyi-Longstaff-Sanders Brownian motion. If the demand is low, the threat of entry diminishes, making deterrence less advantageous. In equilibrium, a weak incumbent may be incentivized to reveal its type by raising prices. We derive an optimal equilibrium using path integral control, where the entrant enters once demand reaches a high enough level, and the weak incumbent mixes strategies between revealing itself when demand is sufficiently low.</description>

      <title>Switchback Price Experiments with Forward-Looking Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a retailer running a switchback experiment for the price of a single product, with infinite supply. In each period, the seller chooses a price $p$ from a set of predefined prices that consist of a reference price and a few discounted price levels. The goal is to estimate the demand gradient at the reference price point, with the goal of adjusting the reference price to improve revenue after the experiment. In our model, in each period, a unit mass of buyers arrives on the market, with values distributed based on a time-varying process. Crucially, buyers are forward looking with a discounted utility and will choose to not purchase now if they expect to face a discounted price in the near future. We show that forward-looking demand introduces bias in naive estimators of the demand gradient, due to intertemporal interference. Furthermore, we prove that there is no estimator that uses data from price experiments with only two price points that can recover the correct demand gradient, even in the limit of an infinitely long experiment with an infinitesimal price discount. Moreover, we characterize the form of the bias of naive estimators. Finally, we show that with a simple three price level experiment, the seller can remove the bias due to strategic forward-looking behavior and construct an estimator for the demand gradient that asymptotically recovers the truth.</description>

      <title>Comparative statics with adjustment costs and the Le Chatelier principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00347v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for models with adjustment costs. We show that comparative-statics conclusions may be drawn under the usual ordinal complementarity assumptions on the objective function, assuming very little about costs: only a mild monotonicity condition is required. We use this insight to prove a general Le Chatelier principle: under the ordinal complementarity assumptions, if short-run adjustment is subject to a monotone cost, then the long-run response to a shock is greater than the short-run response. We extend these results to a fully dynamic model of adjustment over time: the Le Chatelier principle remains valid, and under slightly stronger assumptions, optimal adjustment follows a monotone path. We apply our results to models of saving, production, pricing, labor supply and investment.</description>

      <title>Playing Divide-and-Choose Given Uncertain Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classic divide-and-choose method for equitably allocating divisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian agents. The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions on those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent values and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a common-value component).
  We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game and identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute equilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the distribution over the chooser's value for each good follows a normal distribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of uniform distributions over intervals.
  A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates several striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the divider has a compelling "diversification" incentive in creating the chooser's two options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider's optimal strategy when preferences are known.
  In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of the divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players' levels of knowledge about each other's values, the correlations between the players' values, and the number of goods being divided. Under fairly mild assumptions, we show that the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, while the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.</description>
