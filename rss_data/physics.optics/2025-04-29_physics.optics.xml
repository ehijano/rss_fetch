      <title>Fifth Harmonic and Five-Photon Excitation Fluorescence Multiphoton Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the application of fifth order nonlinear optical processes for multiphoton microscopy, including fifth harmonic and 5-photon excitation fluorescence. This novel imaging modality has been characterized with spectral and power dependence measurements. The advantages of fifth harmonic and 5-photon excitation fluorescence imaging are higher resolution and use of longer wavelength excitation sources, which may allow deeper penetration depth, while still exciting near-UV to blue fluorophores. This imaging modality may find interesting applications in biological research, materials characterization, geologic studies, and semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Photonic logic tensor computing beyond TOPS per core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soaring demand for computing resources has spurred great interest in photonic computing with higher speed and larger computing capacity. Photonic logic gates are of crucial importance due to the fundamental role of Boolean logic in modern digital computing systems. However, most photonic logic schemes struggle to exhibit the capability of massively parallel processing and flexible reconfiguration, owing to weak and fixed nonlinearity in optical elements. Here, we propose a photonic logic tensor computing architecture for the first time and fabricate the photonic universal logic tensor core (PULTC) with a parallel logic computing capacity beyond TOPS. Ten wavelength channels and four spatial channels are designed in PULTC, where the logic computing speed in each channel can reach 50 Gbit/s. After the nonlinear mapping of microring modulators, arbitrary logic operations can be achieved by configuring the Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh. Our work offers an innovative route for photonic universal logic computing with high-parallel capability and propels the practical applications of photonic logic computing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Computation with Linear Optics via Source-Position Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing systems provide an alternate hardware model which appears to be aligned with the demands of neural network workloads. However, the challenge of implementing energy efficient nonlinearities in optics -- a key requirement for realizing neural networks -- is a conspicuous missing link. In this work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully linear media. Our method can operate at low power and requires only the ability to drive the optical system at a data-dependent spatial position. Leveraging this positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated, topology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized optical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and machine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning classification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear methods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Large-scale artificial intelligence with 41 million nanophotonic neurons on a metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional integrated circuits (ICs) struggle to meet the escalating demands of artificial intelligence (AI). This has sparked a renewed interest in an unconventional computing paradigm: neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing. However, current neuromorphic systems face significant challenges in delivering a large number of parameters (i.e., weights) required for large-scale AI models. As a result, most neuromorphic hardware is limited to basic benchmark demonstrations, hindering its application to real-world AI challenges. Here, we present a large-scale optical neural network (ONN) for machine learning acceleration, featuring over 41 million photonic neurons. This system not only surpasses digital electronics in speed and energy efficiency but more importantly, closes the performance gap with large-scale AI models. Our ONN leverages an innovative optical metasurface device featuring numerous spatial modes. This device integrates over 41 million meta-atoms on a 10 mm$^2$ metasurface chip, enabling the processing of tens of millions of weights in a single operation. For the first time, we demonstrate that an ONN, utilizing a single-layer metasurface, can match the performance of deep and large-scale deep learning models, such as ResNet and Vision Transformer, across various benchmark tasks. Additionally, we show that our system can deliver high-performance solutions to real-world AI challenges through its unprecedented scale, such as accelerating the analysis of multi-gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) for cancer detection by processing the million-pixel sub-image in a single shot. Our system reduces computing time and energy consumption by over 1,000 times compared to state-of-the-art graphic processing units (GPUs). This work presents a large-scale, low-power, and high-performance neuromorphic computing system, paving the way for future disruptive AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Spatial-enhanced Reflective Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot hyperspectral imaging (CASSI) system which captures 2-D spatial information and 1-D spectral information in just one or two shots has become a promising technology to capture hyperspectral image (HSI). However, previous CASSI have shortcomings such as poor spatial resolution and low light efficiency that hinder their further applications. In this paper, we propose a spatial-enhanced reflective coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging system (SE-RCASSI). The system achieves superior spatial results and high light efficiency because of its specially designed structure. Then, we propose Spatial-enhanced Network (SEnet) which takes full use of the prior information of grayscale image to boost the reconstruction quality and can serve as an image fusion framework to deploy different algorithms. Furthermore, we propose hybrid prior strategy (HPS) to effectively exploit the broad-scope prior of training set and narrow-scope prior of measurements, resulting in improved generalization and performance of the network. Finally, we fabricate the prototype of SE-RCASSI and conduct experiments in different environments. Both experimental results and numerical simulations show the outstanding performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Quantitative X-ray Schlieren Nanotomography for Hyperspectral Phase and Absorption Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral X-rays imaging holds promise for three-dimensional (3D) chemical analysis but remains limited in simultaneously capturing phase and absorption information due to complex setups and data burdens. We introduce quantitative X-ray schlieren nanotomography (XSN), a simple, fast, and high-resolution X-ray phase imaging technique that overcomes these limitations. XSN employs a partially coherent illumination and a pupil-plane cutoff filter to encode directional phase contrast, enabling single-shot acquisition. A quasi-Newton iterative algorithm reconstructs quantitative phase and absorption images from intensity data, even under strong scattering conditions. Scanning across X-ray energies further allows four-dimensional imaging (3D spatial &amp; spectral). We validate the method's accuracy and resolution on reference samples and apply it to lithium battery cathodes, visualizing nanoscale microcracks and mapping chemical compositions. XSN provides a robust framework for hyperspectral phase nanotomography with broad applicability across materials science, biology, and energy research.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Shaping of Scattering Forces Enhances Optical Trapping of Levitated Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically-levitated nanoparticles in vacuum offer a pristine platform for high-quality mechanical oscillators, enabling a wide range of precision measurements and quantum technologies. A key performance metric in such systems is the stiffness of the optical trap, which is typically enhanced by increasing laser power-at the cost of unwanted heating, reduced coherence, and enhanced quantum backaction. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally new route to increasing trap stiffness: wavefront shaping of the optical field. By tailoring the spatial phase profile of the trapping beam, we significantly boost the mechanical confinement of subwavelength particles without raising the optical intensity. Remarkably, this enhancement arises from a selective reduction of non-conservative optical forces, while preserving the conservative restoring forces that define trap stiffness. As a result, mechanical nonlinearities are also reduced, improving stability at low pressures. Our findings challenge the long-standing assumption that diffraction-limited focusing is optimal for dipolar Rayleigh particles, and establish wavefront shaping as a powerful, readily applicable tool to control optomechanical forces in levitation experiments. This opens new avenues for minimizing backaction, reducing thermal decoherence, and expanding the range of materials that can be stably levitated.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Angular Scattering of Substrated Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properly modeling and predicting the scattering response of a metasurface is a particularly challenging task. This has been shown to be especially difficult if the metasurface supports both local and nonlocal interactions, in the form of lattice coupling effects, multipolar contributions or bianisotropic responses. So far, existing methods to approach this problem have been restricted to normal incidence in a homogeneous background medium. We overcome these limitations by providing a rigorous and comprehensive formalism that accommodates both oblique incidence and the presence of different superstrate and substrate. This is achieved by extending our existing metasurface modeling framework to account for nonlocal and multipolar contributions up to the octupolar order and properly accounting for the scattering effects due to an inhomogeneous background medium. Additionally, our method is based on exact spherical multipole decomposition, which intrinsically accounts for toroidal contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by modeling the response of several dielectric and plasmonic metasurfaces that exhibit sharp spectral features including bound states in the continuum. Overall, our formalism yields excellent agreement with full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>All-dielectric metasurface polarization scrambler for imaging applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization scramblers are essential for many imaging applications involving polarization sensitive instruments and partially polarized fluxes. In such cases, the light must be depolarized to allow properly calibrated measurements. Several types of depolarizers are already in use, but none is optimal due to the inevitable image degradation associated with the scrambling process. Here, we present a device based on an all-dielectric metasurface using anisotropic scatterers capable of generating multiple polarization states by varying their orientation angle. Our new scrambling solution allows a massive reduction in the integrated degree of polarization and thus the spatial depolarization of any incident linear polarization, while allowing easier integration into the instrument design and reducing the impact on its image quality.</description>

      <title>Superradiance in dense atomic samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Problem of No Return Photon Ranging Measurements with Entangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fascinating problem of light detection and ranging measurement without necessitating the return of the photon directed towards the target or object. We approach this challenging problem using quantum entanglement - an entangled pair of photons; one photon is sent toward the target or object, while the other is directed into a medium, which undergoes continuous measurements. We assume the light-matter interaction at the target such that the quantum state collapse is probabilistically biased. We present thought experiments and measurement schemes to conduct correlation measurements and examine the methodology of these measurements to estimate the target's range, using a maximally entangled Bell state ($|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|H_1V_2\rangle + |V_1H_2\rangle)$) as an example. When the photon interacts with the target, the Bell state undergoes biased decoherence or state collapse, leaving a signature in the spatial correlation G(x) quantity.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Evolution of Near-Field Photonic Qubits into High-Dimensional Qudits via State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nanophotonics offers essential tools and technologies for controlling quantum states, while maintaining a miniature form factor and high scalability. For example, nanophotonic platforms can transfer information from the traditional degrees of freedom (DoFs), such as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), to the DoFs of the nanophotonic platform - and back, opening new directions for quantum information processing. Recent experiments have utilized the total angular momentum (TAM) of a photon as a unique means to produce entangled qubits in nanophotonic platforms. Yet, the process of transferring the information between the free-space DoFs and the TAM was never investigated, and its implications are still unknown. Here, we reveal the evolution of quantum information in heralded single photons as they couple into and out of the near-field of a nanophotonic system. Through quantum state tomography, we discover that the TAM qubit in the near-field becomes a free-space qudit entangled in the photonic SAM and OAM. The extracted density matrix and Wigner function in free-space indicate state preparation fidelity above 97%. The concepts described here bring new concepts and methodologies in developing high-dimensional quantum circuitry on a chip.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of theoretical and experimental investigation of optical linear dichroism signals caused by alignment, and arising under the action of pumping with linearly polarized light in a magnetic field transverse to the pumping in an ensemble of hydrogen-like (including alkali) atoms. Several simple models implying mixing of Zeeman sublevels of the excited state are considered, and common patterns among them are identified. It is shown that in the general case the properties of the medium causing dichroism can be characterized by only two parameters, {\Delta}x and {\Delta}y, while in the case of complete mixing - by a single parameter {\Delta}. Expressions that relate these parameters to the transition probabilities are provided, as is an extension of the theory for the case of incomplete mixing of sublevels of the excited state. The single-beam scheme for recording linear dichroism signals, which is of greatest interest from a practical point of view, is investigated. It is shown that incomplete mixing can lead to inversion of dichroism signals in systems including more than one optical transition. A comparison with the results of an experimental study of dichroism in alkali metal (cesium) vapors is made.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength thermometry without a priori emissivity information: from promise to disillusionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) thermography provides 2D radiance maps of the IR radiation leaving the surfaces of a scene, based on preliminary calibration. Then, to convert radiance maps into temperature maps, we need to know the emissivity of each element of the scene conjugated to each of the detector elements in the camera's focal plane. Compared to the single-band approach, can multispectral thermography help solve the inverse temperature-emissivity separation problem? Multiwavelength thermometry (MWT) is known to be an underdetermined problem having a continuous infinity of solutions. For this reason, and right from the origin of MWT, it appeared necessary to introduce information on emissivity to assess temperature, for example, by means of an analytical model. Overlooking these recommendations, a number of papers appeared in the early 2000s exploring the idea that we could do without any a priori knowledge of emissivity. Growth became exponential from 2020 onward, with the allegedly successful application of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other novel optimization methods. The aim of the present work is to recall the consequences of MWT as an underdetermined inverse problem, to highlight the errors made by ignoring them, and to bring us back to harsh reality: we must introduce information on emissivity in order to evaluate temperature accurately. Furthermore, this information has to be fully consistent with the true spectral emissivity. To this end, we propose a new method for optimal selection of the emissivity model. A series of blind tests was set up to benchmark different inversion algorithms. The results confirm the failure of the temperature-emissivity separation when no emissivity information is available, despite the multiwavelength approach, which in any case comes as no surprise.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverse design of large-area metasurfaces for incoherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incoherent light is ubiquitous, yet designing optical devices that can handle its random nature is very challenging, since directly averaging over many incoherent incident beams can require a huge number of scattering calculations. We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of "annular" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Differential High-Frequency Lock-In Probe for Laser-Induced Vacuum Birefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of laser-induced vacuum birefringence through the use of pulsed lasers coupled to femtosecond optical enhancement cavities. This measurement technique features cavity-enhanced pump and probe pulses, as well as an independent control pulse. The control pulse allows for a differential measurement where the final signal is obtained using high-frequency lock-in detection, greatly mitigating time-dependent cavity birefringence as an important and possibly prohibitive systematic effect. In addition, the method features the economical use of laser power, and results in a relatively simple experimental setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of resonant optical torque that allows enhancing substantially a transfer of optical angular momentum (AM) of light to a subwavelength particle. We consider high-index cylindrical dielectric nanoparticles supporting Mie resonances, and explore a transfer of AM and how it is affected by absorption and particle shape. We analyse a simple trapping geometry of standing wave patterns created by opposite helical light waves. We uncover stable rotation of particles in both nodes and anti-nodes, and also study how specific particle properties influence the resonant optical torque. We demonstrate that adjusting particle losses can maximize spinning torque, and we predict "super-torque" originating from the superabsorption effect at resonances. Our study offers a deeper understanding of the physics of resonant optical torque and its importance in manipulating AM transfer in optical systems, with promising implications for various fields and inspiring further research in resonant light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Broadband Angular-selective Mid-infrared Photodetector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mid-infrared photodetectors are susceptible to background noise since every object in the surroundings emits thermal radiation from different directions. To reduce this background noise and enhance signal-to-noise ratio of mid-infrared sensing, different strategies to achieve angular-selective filtering have been proposed. However, these methods are either wavelength- and polarization-dependent, or require bulky lens or mirror systems. The former compromises the photodetector sensitivity, and the latter makes it difficult to integrate with wearable or on-chip devices. In this study, we present a novel angular-selective microstructure array that can seamlessly integrate onto a mid-infrared photodetector. Our compact device leverages the conservation of etendue to attain high angular selectivity over a broad range of mid-infrared wavelengths. Radiation from unwanted angles is substantially filtered, which leads to a markedly enhanced photodetection signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the device's photoresponse is shown to be polarization- and wavelength-insensitive, avoiding signal losses associated with narrow spectral ranges or polarization dependence, and therefore circumventing degradation in photodetector sensitivity. Our broadband angular-selective mid-infrared photodetector holds great promise for wearable devices, medical diagnostics and space applications.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Circuit Modeling of a Lumped-element Loaded Metasurface under Arbitrary Incidence and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we develop a simple equivalent circuit model (ECM) that predicts the spectral response of a lumped-element loaded single patterned layer reflective metasurface. The proposed ECM maintains accuracy across varying design parameters including dual-polarization, arbitrary obliquity and azimuthal rotation of incidence plane, as well as physical dimensions of the lumped elements. Our approach is built incrementally, starting from an elementary unit cell which is extended to a 2-by-2 arrangement that allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in both polarizations, independently. These capabilities facilitate the design of tunable holographic metasurfaces which can implement reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for advanced wireless communication systems. We evaluate the limitations and accuracy of the proposed ECM with full-wave simulations (FWS), which evidence robustness up to 45 degrees and thus highlight its aptitude as a rapid design tool or a guide for FWS-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation in Complex Wave Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomena involving multiple scattering, despite having attracted considerable attention in physics for decades, continue to generate unexpected and counterintuitive behaviours prompting further studies. For optical scattering, the memory effect well predicts fourth order statistics, i.e. the intensity correlation, as long as the scattering strength and depth are within certain bounds. The memory effect has found a wide range of applications, where its limitations also become apparent: for example, in imaging through turbid media, decorrelation due to multiscattering in thick samples has been shown to restrict the field of view. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive mechanism exists to date that can account for decorrelation precisely. In this paper, we quantify how the scatterer's own statistics determine such limitations. We show that the ensemble statistics of the backscattered field may be decomposed into two terms: one expresses surface scattering, where statistical distributions of multiscale structure features may be inferred from our previous works; while the second term originates from the underlying scattering volume and is diffusive. The new framework agrees well with experiments, including the prediction of a new quasipower law for fluctuations induced by the single realization.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we first provided a brief overview of cellulose structures, categorizing various types of nanocellulose based on their production methods, and discussed different photonic structures such as cholesteric phases, photonic crystals, distributed Bragg reflectors, and inverse photonic structures. We then reviewed some models that predict optical properties, including refractive index, scattering, reflection, and birefringence, highlighting factors that can influence these properties, such as electric field, surface roughness, temperature, and density, among others. Following this, we explored recent advancements in predicting optical properties, particularly the use of AI-driven algorithms to enhance the prediction of optical behaviors in nanomaterials. Finally, we provided an in-depth discussion of the latest developments in nonlinear optical phenomena and chiroptical responses in nanocellulose-based materials, focusing on circularly polarized luminescence, structural colors, structural correlations, the impact of enantiomers, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a procedure to identify and classify genuine tripartite entanglement in pure 3-qubit states via the Activated Bipartite Entanglement (ABE), which is defined here as the difference between the Entanglement of Assistance and the Entanglement of Formation. We show that for pure states belonging to one of the two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., GHZ or W states, the ABE is always greater than zero. For separable and biseparable states it is always null. In addition, our approach is capable to distinguish between genuine tripartite entangled states, those belonging to the GHZ-class from those belonging to the W-class. We also present an experimental proposal, by using linear optical circuits and internal degrees of freedom of a single photon, to measure the ABE and to verify the characterization via activated entanglement. The circuit simulation shows an excellent agreement with theoretical prediction for a wide class of GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>On Chip Quantum States Generation by Incoherent Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip quantum sources based on nonlinear processes are pivotal components in integrated photonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologies over recent decades. Usually, the pump coherence has been considered to be crucial for ensuring the quality of generated states, therefore incoherent light is rarely used in quantum information processing. In this work, we explore and reveal the constructive influence of pumped temporal incoherence on the quantum properties of photon sources. Taking silicon waveguides as nonlinear media, we theoretically show that temporal incoherence of light can improve pumping utilization efficiency, resulting in higher source brightness in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process, and the spectrally uncorrelated nature of incoherent light is transferred to the generated photon source, allowing high-purity state preparation. Experimentally, we obtain a higher photon pair generation rate and the lower heralded second-order autocorrelation with an Amplified Spontaneous Emission source. Additionally, we successfully generate a polarization-entangled state with Bell inequality violation of S = 2.64 and a fidelity of 95.7%. Our study reveals the mechanism behind incoherently pumped quantum states and presents a method for generating photon sources using an easily accessible incoherent light.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement and qubit error rate dependence on the exciton-phonon coupling in self-assembled quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. A near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is essential to minimize qubit error rates in key distribution. This study theoretically investigates the polarization entangled photon pairs produced by a quantum-dot radiative cascade located within a micropillar cavity. To incorporate the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling in a quantum dot-cavity system, we develop a polaron master equation theory and investigate how it affects the degree of entanglement and qubit error rate. We derive analytical expressions of various phonon-induced incoherent rates and demonstrate that one-photon incoherent rates predominate, substantially diminishing the degree of entanglement. It is shown that at elevated temperatures, the role of cavity-mediated effects such as cross-coupling between exciton states, ac-Stark shift, and multiphoton emission gets reduced owing to the phonon-mediated renormalization of the cavity coupling and Rabi frequency. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol and show the evolution of qubit error rate at elevated temperatures of the phonon bath.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random numbers are essential for security against quantum algorithms. Randomness as a beacon is a service being provided for companies and governments to upgrade their security standards from RSA to PQC-QKD or PQC-RSA protocols. Both security mechanisms assume trust in the service provider unless one aims for device-independent protocols. How does an entity ensure that the beacon service has a quantum signature other than relying on faith? Specifically, given a bit-stream, can a user verify a quantum signature in it? Researchers claim this is indecipherable and have stated a no-go theorem for post-processed bit-streams [Physical Review A \textbf{109}, 022243 (2024)]. In this article, we corroborate the results of the no-go theorem while discussing its nuances using two different random number generators and four test methods. These include the NIST statistical test suite and machine learning algorithms that strengthen the theorem. This work is relevant for companies and governments using QRNG, provided to enhance security against quantum threats.</description>
