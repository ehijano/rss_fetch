      <title>Periodically Poled Piezoelectric Lithium Niobate Resonator for Piezoelectric Power Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for compact and efficient power conversion systems increases, piezoelectric power converters have gained attention for their ability to replace bulky magnetic inductors with acoustic resonators, enabling higher power density and improved efficiency. Achieving optimal converter performance requires resonators with high quality factor ($Q$), strong electromechanical coupling ($k^2$), high power handling capability, and a spurious-free response. Lithium niobate (LN) has emerged as a promising material in this context due to its high figure of merit (FoM = $Q \cdot k^2$). While previous studies on single-layer LN resonators have demonstrated high FoM values, they typically operate at relatively low resonance frequencies ($f_s$). Recently, periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) structures, formed by stacking piezoelectric layers with alternating crystal orientations, have shown the potential to both scale up the operating frequency and enhance the FoM compared to single-layer counterparts in piezoelectric power conversion. This work presents the first P3F thickness-extensional (TE) LN resonator for power conversion, operating at 19.23 MHz, with a large \textit{$k^2$} of 29\% and a high \textit{Q} of 3187, achieving a state-of-the-art (\textit{ $f_s \cdot Q$}) product among piezoelectric power resonators. A high-power testing procedure is performed to systematically study the nonlinear behavior and power handling of P3F LN for power applications. With further optimization, P3F TE resonators have the potential to open up a new design space for high-power and high-frequency power conversion.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial critical behavior at the magnetic transitions: A case study of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the critical behavior of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$ in the vicinity of its second-order magnetoelastic transition at $T_ {\rm c} = 173$ K. The critical exponents (CEs) $\beta$ and $\gamma$, determined using both the standard convergence procedure and the average normalized slope (ANS) method, diverge at $T_{\rm c}$: a characteristic typically associated with first-order transitions. Notably, none of the established universality classes satisfactorily describe the critical behavior of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$, and we discuss the possible origins of this deviation in the context of the strong spin-lattice coupling intrinsic to the sample. We emphasize the importance of accurately selecting the critical temperature and magnetic field ranges to ensure robust critical behavior analysis and propose a quantitative approach to assess the reliability of the extracted CEs. Additionally, we demonstrate that in the ANS method, the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$ should be calculated separately using data for $T \leqslant T_{\rm c}$ and $T \geqslant T_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our findings underscore the need for a revised theoretical framework to accurately describe second-order magnetoelastic transitions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper formally defines optogeometric factor as a pixel level measure of geometric optical throughput.
  The quantity is formally defined as the surface solid angle integral of the local etendue between a pixel and its corresponding scene element. Under ideal geometric optical conditions, it can be approximated by the product of the projected pixel footprint area on the object plane and the solid angle covered by the entrance pupil. Provides a compact link between the radiance of the scene and the radiant flux collected by a single pixel, making explicit the spatial angular coupling that governs the radiometric measurements at the pixel level.
  Two mathematically equivalent expressions of optogeometric factor are derived: a scene based form, expressed via the footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed via the pixel pitch and optical f number. Their equivalence is demonstrated analytically and confirmed using representative parameters of real thermal imaging systems.
  The concept is extended to effective optogeometric factor, which incorporates the pixel fill factor to account for the active area of the sensor. This concept enables a clear separation of geometric optical coupling from detector design and other calibration terms, offering a physically transparent and transferable basis for quantitative thermography and other imaging modalities operating in the geometric optics regime.</description>

      <title>Energetically Favored One-Dimensional Moir\'e Superstructure in the Pseudo-Square Lattice GdTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e engineering in layered crystals has recently gained considerable attention due to the discovery of various structural and physical phenomena, including interfacial reconstruction, superconductivity, magnetism, and distinctive optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, most explored moir\'e systems have been limited to hexagonal lattices, thereby constraining a comprehensive understanding and technological application of moir\'e phenomena in general layered crystals. Here, we investigate GdTe3, a pseudo-tetragonal layered crystal, as a platform to explore unconventional moir\'e phenomena. GdTe3 exhibits a slight in-plane distortion correlated with the direction of charge density wave formation. Through vertical stacking of layers with different distortions-induced via a controlled strain/release process-we realize energetically favorable one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e superstructures. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution scanning TEM imaging, dark-field TEM imaging, and sample tilting experiments, we systematically examine stacking variations across the 1D moir\'e structure. Additionally, electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals modulations in electronic properties associated with the 1D moir\'e structure. Our findings expand the scope of moir\'e systems beyond conventional hexagonal twistronics, enabling exploration of moir\'e phenomena in low-symmetry van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Switchable Polarization Lasing between q-BIC and Bragg Resonance Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) enable low-threshold lasing through high-Q cavity modes, yet their polarization tunability remains constrained by nanostructure-imposed cavity symmetries. By engineering a microcavity with an optimized duty cycle (0.34), we demonstrate a polarization-switchable distributed feedback (DFB) laser with controlled emission transitions between dual off-{\Gamma} q-BIC lasing and single {\Gamma}-point Bragg resonance (BR) lasing through switching pump polarization. The switching mechanism shows unprecedented robustness in varying waveguide thickness and photonic crystal period of DFB structures. Our findings extend the capabilities of DFB lasers beyond their conventional limits, opening opportunities for nanophotonics, classical and quantum optics applications.</description>

      <title>Zeolitic imidazolate framework glasses emit white light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) glasses represent a newly emerged class of melt-quenched glasses, characterized by their intrinsic nanoporous structure, good processability, and multifunctionalities such as gas separation and energy storage. However, creating photonic functionalities in Zn-based ZIF glasses remains elusive. Here we show a remarkable broadband white light-emitting behavior in a Zn-based ZIF glass, which can be enhanced by annealing. Furthermore, we discovered a sharp red shift upon increasing annealing temperature above the critical temperature of 1.07Tg, where Tg is the glass transition temperature, for a short duration of 30 min. Finally, we achieved a high absolute internal photoluminescence quantum yield of 12.2% upon annealing of ZIF glass at 1.13Tg. Based on the optimally annealed ZIF glass, we fabricated a white light-emitting diode (LED) with the luminous efficacy of 4.2 lm/W and high operational stability, retaining 74.1% of its initial luminous efficacy after 180 min of continuous operation. These results not only demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing ZIF glasses in LED applications but also mark a significant advancement in the development of durable, efficient, and multifunctional photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Quasi-1D Electronic Metadevices with Enhanced Electrical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic metadevices leveraging sub-wavelength metallic features have shown great potential for high-frequency switching. Theoretical analysis based on a one-dimensional (1D) model indicates that reducing the size of subwavelength features can enhance electrical properties, such as contact resistance and switching cutoff frequency. Here, we report higher-than-expected contact resistance in electronic metadevices when the subwavelength feature size is aggressively downscaled. We attribute this effect to transverse currents in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) running parallel to the stripe width. We present the first experimental demonstration of a metadevice governed by a one-dimensional model, which we refer to as a quasi-1D electronic metadevice and show that it enables enhanced electrical performance. Our findings pave the way to design next generation electronic metadevice switches with applications in future telecommunication circuits.</description>

      <title>Surface Plasmon Polaritons: Creation Dynamics and Interference of Slow and Fast Propagating SPPs at a Temporal Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation of quantum emitters as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) cavities offer a scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). Unlike traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach uses lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, CMOS-compatible modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance regime with linear, high sensitivity to small perturbations. Using silicon PICs as an example, we show detection limits down to 10^{-9} RIU for Q = 10^5-10^7 cavities, matching or exceeding plasmonic and microresonator sensors with simpler instrumentation. Long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon allow sub-nanosecond shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of silicon-based quantum emitters remains unproven, the concept is generic and applicable to other PIC platforms, including diamond-, silicon nitride-, and silicon carbide-based systems where such operation is established.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Voltage-Controlled Cryogenic Boolean Logic Paradigm with Quantum-Enhanced Josephson Junction FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for ultra low power computing and the emergence of quantum technologies have intensified interest in cryogenic electronics, particularly superconducting devices. Despite their promise, current controlled superconducting components face fundamental challenges in cascadability, limiting their effectiveness in complex logic architectures. To overcome this, recent efforts have focused on developing gate tunable superconducting devices, such as Josephson junction field effect transistors (JJFETs). However, achieving robust control and sufficient supercurrent gain, both critical for transistor-like performance in logic circuits remains a key challenge. A recent advancement in JJFET design, based on InAs and GaSb heterostructures, demonstrates enhanced gain and favorable device characteristics suitable for circuit integration. Building on this innovation, we propose and analyze fundamental voltage controlled logic topologies using the quantum enhanced JJFET. We develop a Verilog A based circuit compatible compact model of the quantum enhanced JJFET which accurately captures the experimentally observed device characteristics. To ensure cascadability, our logic circuits incorporate the multilayered Heater Nanocryotron (nTron), a superconducting nanowire-based thermal switch. Through simulation based analysis, we demonstrate the successful implementation of fundamental logic gates, including NOT, NAND, and NOR. Furthermore, we design a 3 input majority gate, which plays a pivotal role in quantum and reversible computing due to its universality. Finally, to demonstrate the cascadability of our proposed logic topology, we demonstrate the operation of a 2 input XOR gate based on our designed JJFET based NOT, NAND, and NOR gate.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Arctic dual-channel sound speed profile based on random airgun signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the unique dual-channel sound speed profiles of the Canadian Basin and the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic, based on the propagation characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles, an inversion method using refracted normal modes for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. This method proposes a dual-parameter representation method for dual-channel sound speed profiles, tailored to the characteristics of dual-channel sound speed profiles. A dispersion structure extraction method is proposed for the dispersion structure characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles. Combining the parameter representation method of sound speed profiles and the dispersion structure extraction method, an inversion method for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. For the common horizontal variation of sound speed profiles in long-distance acoustic propagation, a method for inverting horizontally varying dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. Finally, this article verifies the effectiveness of the dual-channel sound speed profile inversion method using the Arctic low-frequency long-range acoustic propagation experiment. Compared with previous sound speed profile inversion methods, the method proposed in this article has the advantages of fewer inversion parameters and faster inversion speed. It can be implemented using only a single hydrophone passively receiving random air gun signals, and it also solves the inversion problem of horizontal variation of sound speed profiles. It has significant advantages such as low cost, easy deployment, and fast computation speed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic source depth estimation method based on a single hydrophone in Arctic underwater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the normal mode and ray theory, this article discusses the characteristics of surface sound source and reception at the surface layer, and explores depth estimation methods based on normal modes and rays, and proposes a depth estimation method based on the upper limit of modal frequency. Data verification is conducted to discuss the applicability and limitations of different methods. For the surface refracted normal mode waveguide, modes can be separated through warping transformation. Based on the characteristics of normal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source depth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the receiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray trajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time difference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field patterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method.</description>
