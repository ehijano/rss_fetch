      <title>Multidecadal forcing of European windstorm losses in CMIP6-DAMIP models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large variations of European storm activity at decadal and longer timescales have been found to be driven by major tropical volcanic eruptions, internal climate variability and anthropogenic aerosols (AA). The insurance industry have the ability to align with these slow fluctuations in windstorm risk, yet have not done so, due to uncertainty in how the climate diagnostics used by researchers relate to insured losses. A key aim of this study was to link past research findings to insurance applications by measuring the impacts of AA on European property damage. This was done by extracting the winds from a set of climate model experiments on AA forcing and converting them into European storm losses using an established technique. The multimodel mean result indicates AA boosted insured windstorm losses by 45% in the late 20th century relative to preindustrial times, though model changes range from zero to a doubling of losses and suggest large uncertainty in the size of the strengthening. Further analysis of individual model simulations suggested both AA and internal climate variability explain about half of the amplitude of the last peak, implying a significant role for volcanic eruptions. Looking ahead, we cannot be sure of the timing of the next peak since it may require at least one major volcanic eruption, but climate models provide encouraging signs that recent cuts in AA emissions from North America and Europe will act to reduce its severity.</description>

      <title>Stop using root-mean-square error as a precipitation target!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root-mean-square error (RMSE) remains the default training loss for data-driven precipitation models, despite precipitation being semi-continuous, zero-inflated, strictly non-negative, and heavy-tailed. This Gaussian-implied objective misspecifies the data-generating process because it tolerates negative predictions, underpenalises rare heavy events, and ignores the mass at zero. We propose replacing RMSE with the Tweedie deviance, a likelihood-based and differentiable loss from the exponential--dispersion family with variance function $V(\mu)=\mu^p$. For $1&lt;p&lt;2$ it yields a compound Poisson--Gamma distribution with a point mass at zero and a continuous density for $y&gt;0$, matching observed precipitation characteristics. We (i) estimate $p$ from the variance--mean power law and show that precipitation across temporal aggregations is far from Gaussian, with the Tweedie power $p$ increasing with accumulation length towards a Gamma limit; and (ii) demonstrate consistent skill gains when training deep data-driven models with Tweedie deviance in place of RMSE. In diffusion-model downscaling over Beijing, Tweedie loss improves wet-pixel MAE and extreme recall ($\sim0.60$ vs $0.50$ at the 99th percentile). In ConvLSTM nowcasting over Kolkata, Tweedie loss yields improved wet-pixel MAE and dry-pixel hit rates, with improvements that compound autoregressively with lead time (for MAE, $\sim2%$ at $t{+}1$ growing to $\sim16%$ at $t{+}4$). Because the Tweedie deviance is continuous in $p$, it adapts smoothly across scales, offering a statistically justified, practical replacement for RMSE in precipitation-based learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to downscale coarse-resolution environmental variables for understanding the spatial frequency of convective storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global climate models (GCMs), typically run at ~100-km resolution, capture large-scale environmental conditions but cannot resolve convection and cloud processes at kilometer scales. Convection-permitting models offer higher-resolution simulations that explicitly simulate convection but are computationally expensive and impractical for large ensemble runs. This study explores machine learning (ML) as a bridge between these approaches. We train simple, pixel-based neural networks to predict convective storm frequency from environmental variables produced by a regional convection-permitting model. The ML models achieve promising results, with structural similarity index measure (SSIM) values exceeding 0.8, capturing the diurnal cycle and orographic convection without explicit temporal or spatial coordinates as input. Model performance declines when fewer input features are used or specific regions are excluded, underscoring the role of diverse physical mechanisms in convective activity. These findings highlight ML potential as a computationally efficient tool for representing convection and as a means of scientific discovery, offering insights into convective processes. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which depend on spatial structure and grid size, the pixel-based model treats each grid point independently, enabling value-to-value prediction without spatial context. This design enhances adaptability to resolution changes and supports generalization to unseen environmental regimes, making it particularly suited for linking environmental conditions to convective features and for application across diverse model grids or climate scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark Dataset for Satellite-Based Estimation and Detection of Rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately tracking the global distribution and evolution of precipitation is essential for both research and operational meteorology. Satellite observations remain the only means of achieving consistent, global-scale precipitation monitoring. While machine learning has long been applied to satellite-based precipitation retrieval, the absence of a standardized benchmark dataset has hindered fair comparisons between methods and limited progress in algorithm development.
  To address this gap, the International Precipitation Working Group has developed SatRain, the first AI-ready benchmark dataset for satellite-based detection and estimation of rain, snow, graupel, and hail. SatRain includes multi-sensor satellite observations representative of the major platforms currently used in precipitation remote sensing, paired with high-quality reference estimates from ground-based radars corrected using rain gauge measurements. It offers a standardized evaluation protocol to enable robust and reproducible comparisons across machine learning approaches.
  In addition to supporting algorithm evaluation, the diversity of sensors and inclusion of time-resolved geostationary observations make SatRain a valuable foundation for developing next-generation AI models to deliver more accurate, detailed, and globally consistent precipitation estimates.</description>

      <title>A Planetary Cooling Hose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geoengineering may offer a way to pause global warming, providing the time for more permanent solutions to become effective. Erection of a high-altitude hose offers an affordable and near-term approach to deliver sulfur-bearing fluids to the stratosphere in order to perform geoengineering via solar radiation management. We discuss the design of a hose extending to an altitude of 20 km and sized to deliver 100 ktons of sulfur per year. The sulfur, in the form of H$_2$S, is pushed up the hose by a pump on the ground and then sprayed out at the top, forming H$_2$SO$_4$ aerosols which scatter enough sunlight to perform geoengineering. Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to deliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from a single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough to test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites across the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$.
  Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid and the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose requires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose walls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose. The hose is held up by a suite of balloons, either all at its top, or with some placed along its length as well. The greatest challenge in suspending such a hose is wind, which if not dealt with properly (by streamlining both the balloons and the hose) will collapse the hose. The wide hoses needed to deliver gaseous H$_2$S are particularly susceptible to wind, so must be enclosed within lightweight aero-shrouds to reduce wind forces.
  After treating the design of these two hoses, we lay out the steps needed to develop and fabricate them, and conclude with some thoughts on how the hoses might be fielded.</description>

      <title>A CFD model for heat and mass transfer leading to plume formation within Wet Cooling Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crucial role played by Wet Cooling Towers (WCT) in many electricity production plants (e.g. nuclear power plants) make them a key parameter in the industrial design of such facilities. Their impact over the cooling water consumption and surrounding atmosphere through the formation and dispersion of a humid air plume has pushed the need to obtain proper models and simulations in order to anticipate those effects. In this work, we tackle this issue through a dedicated modelling in the CFD solver code_saturne. Specific modeling includes heat and mass transfer (convection and evaporation) between the injected water and the air flow that are validated against experimental results obtained in a reduced scale WCT experimental loop. Satisfying agreement is obtained for several parameters such as air and water exit temperatures, evaporation mass flow rate and total exchanged thermal power. This constitutes an important first step for detailed CFD predictions of WCT water consumption and humid air plume atmospheric dispersion.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</description>
