      <title>Transposing cartesian and other structure in double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cartesian structure possessed by morphisms like relations, spans, and profunctors is elegantly expressed by universal properties in double categories. Though cartesian double categories were inspired in part by the older program of cartesian bicategories, the precise relationship between the double-categorical and bicategorical approaches has so far remained mysterious, except in special cases. We provide a formal connection by showing that every double category with iso-strong finite products, and in particular every cartesian equipment, has an underlying cartesian bicategory. To do so, we develop broadly applicable techniques for transposing natural transformations and adjunctions between double categories, extending a line of previous work rooted in the concepts of companions and conjoints.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics in infinite monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss formulas for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of summands in tensor powers in certain (finite or infinite) monoidal categories. Our focus is on monoidal categories with infinitely many indecomposable objects, with our main tools being generalized Perron-Frobenius theory alongside techniques from random walks.</description>

      <title>Gluing algebraic quantum field theories on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that, given an algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) on a manifold $M$ and an open cover $\{M_\alpha\}$ of $M$, it is typically not possible to recover the global algebra of observables on $M$ by simply gluing the underlying local algebras subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$. Instead of gluing local algebras, we introduce a gluing construction of AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ and we show that for simple examples of AQFTs, constructed out for geometric data, gluing the local AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ recovers the global AQFT on $M$. This result implies that the local AQFTs contain more information than the local algebras.</description>

      <title>Center construction for group-crossed tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of the $(G,\Gamma)$-crossed center of a $(G,\Gamma)$-crossed tensor category in the sense of Natale. We show that the $(G, \Gamma)$-crossed center is a $(G \bowtie \Gamma, G \times \Gamma)$-braided tensor category. This construction generalizes the graded center construction for graded tensor categories and the equivariant center construction for tensor categories with group actions.</description>

      <title>Properties and Characterisations of Cofree Cartesian Differential Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartesian differential categories come equipped with a differential operator which formalises the total derivative from multivariable calculus. Cofree Cartesian differential categories always exist over a specified base category, where the general construction is based on Faa di Bruno's formula. A natural question to ask is, when given an arbitrary Cartesian differential category, how can one check if it is cofree without knowing the base category? In this paper, we provide characterisations of cofree Cartesian differential categories without specifying a base category. The key to these characterisations is, surprisingly, maps whose derivatives are zero, which we call differential constants. One characterisation is in terms of the homsets being complete ultrametric spaces, where the ultrametric is induced by differential constants, which is similar to the metric for power series. Another characterisation is as algebras of a monad. In either characterisation, the base category is the category of differential constants. We also discuss other basic properties of cofree Cartesian differential categories, such as the linear maps, and explain how many well-known Cartesian differential categories (such as polynomial or smooth functions) are not cofree.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Entropy as a Universal Monoidal Natural Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the essential properties of entropy (monotonicity, additivity and subadditivity) are consequences of entropy being a monoidal natural transformation from the under category functor $-/\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ (where $\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ is category of $\rho$-th-power-summable probability distributions, $0&lt;\rho&lt;1$) to $\Delta_{\mathbb{R}}$. Moreover, the Shannon entropy can be characterized as the universal monoidal natural transformation from $-/\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ to the category of integrally closed partially ordered abelian groups (a reflective subcategory of the lax-slice 2-category over $\mathsf{MonCat}_{\ell}$ in the 2-category of monoidal categories), providing a succinct characterization of Shannon entropy as a reflection arrow. We can likewise define entropy for every monoidal category with a monoidal structure on its under categories (e.g. the category of finite abelian groups, the category of finite inhabited sets, the category of finite dimensional vector spaces, and the augmented simplex category) via the reflection arrow. This implies that all these entropies over different categories are components of a single natural transformation (the unit of the idempotent monad), allowing us to connect these entropies in a natural manner. We also provide a universal characterization of the conditional Shannon entropy based on the chain rule which, unlike the characterization of information loss by Baez, Fritz and Leinster, does not require any continuity assumption.</description>

      <title>Costability of Comodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the {\em stabilization} of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>
