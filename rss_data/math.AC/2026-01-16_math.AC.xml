      <title>Complexity and curvature of (pairs of) Cohen-Macaulay modules, and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity and curvature of a module, introduced by Avramov, measure the growth of Betti and Bass numbers of a module, and distinguish the modules of infinite homological dimension. The notion of complexity was extended by Avramov-Buchweitz to pairs of modules that measure the growth of Ext modules. The related notion of Tor complexity was first studied by Dao. Inspired by these notions, we define Ext and Tor curvature of pairs of modules. The aim of this article is to study (Ext and Tor) complexity and curvature of pairs of certain CM (Cohen-Macaulay) modules, and establish lower bounds of complexity and curvature of pairs of modules in terms of that of a single module. It is known that among all modules, the residue field has maximal complexity and curvature, moreover they characterize complete intersection local rings. As applications of our results, we provide some upper bounds of the curvature of the residue field in terms of curvature and multiplicity of any nonzero CM module. As a final upshot, these allow us to characterize complete intersection local rings (including hypersurfaces and regular rings) in terms of complexity and curvature of pairs of certain CM modules. In particular, under some additional hypotheses, we characterize complete intersection and regular local rings via injective curvature of the ring and that of the module of K\"{a}hler differentials respectively. Thus, we make partial progress towards a question of Christensen-Striuli-Veliche, as well as another by Vasconcelos.</description>

      <title>Test properties of some Cohen-Macaulay modules and criteria for local rings via finite vanishing of Ext or Tor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show test properties, in the sense of finitely many vanishing of Ext or Tor, of CM (Cohen-Macaulay) modules whose multiplicity and number of generators (resp., type) are related by certain inequalities. We apply these test behaviour, along with other results, to characterize various kinds of local rings, including hypersurface rings of multiplicity at most two, surprisingly requiring only finitely many vanishing of Ext or Tor involving such CM modules. As further applications, we verify the long-standing (Generalized) Auslander-Reiten Conjecture for every CM module of minimal multiplicity over a Noetherian local ring, thus vastly extending a result of Huneke-\c{S}ega-Vraciu.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay approximations and the $\text{SC}_r$-condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relation between MCM approximations and FID hulls of modules over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring $R$ with canonical module, specifically when $R$ is generically Gorenstein. We then generalize a result of Kato, who proved that a Gorenstein complete local ring $R$ satisfies the $\text{SC}_{2}$-condition if and only if $R$ is a UFD. For $r \geq 3$, we prove a criterion for when an MCM $R$-module $M$ satisfies the $\text{SC}_{r}$-condition, assuming that its first syzygy $\Omega_{R}^{1}(M)$ satisfies the $\text{SC}_{r-1}$-condition.</description>

      <title>Complexity and curvature of pairs of Burch modules and ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity and curvature of a module were first introduced by Avramov to distinguish modules of infinite homological dimension. Later, Avramov-Buchweitz extended the notion of complexity from a single module to that of pairs of modules, which measures the polynomial growth rate of the minimal number of generators of their Ext modules. Dao studied a similar notion of Tor-complexity. Recently, Dey-Ghosh-Saha initiated the study of Ext and Tor curvature of a pair of modules, which measure the exponential growth rates of the corresponding Ext and Tor, respectively. On the other hand, the concept of Burch ideals was introduced by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi, motivated by the classical work of Burch, and subsequently extended to modules by Dey-Kobayashi. This class includes several large and well-studied families of modules and ideals over a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m},k)$. For example, these include the residue field $k$ as an $R$-module, every nonzero module of the form $\mathfrak{m} M$ (e.g., $\mathfrak{m}^n$ for $n\ge 1$), and under mild conditions every integrally closed ideal $I$ with $\rm{depth}(R/I)=0$. Suppose $I$ and $J$ are Burch ideals such that $I$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-primary. Motivated by Avramov's result that Burch modules exhibit extremal complexity and curvature, we establish in this article that $\rm{cx}_R(I,J)=\rm{tcx}_R(I,J)=\rm{cx}_R(k)$. Moreover, we show that $R$ is complete intersection if and only if $\rm{cx}_R(I,J)$ or $\rm{tcx}_R(I,J)$ is finite if and only if $\rm{curv}_R(I,J)$ or $\mathrm{tcurv}_R(I,J)$ is at most $1$. We deduce these results from the corresponding more general results on Burch modules.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Teter rings via the canonical trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Puthenpurakal's higher-dimensional Teter rings via the canonical trace ideal. We give a sufficient criterion for Teterness and show that, in the standard graded case, it is also necessary, yielding a characterization. Consequently, several nearly Gorenstein families are Teter; moreover, under certain hypotheses, the Cohen--Macaulay type of nearly Gorenstein rings is bounded by the codimension. We also analyze Teterness for fiber products, Veronese subrings, and numerical semigroup rings.</description>

      <title>A non-Archimedean Arens--Eells isometric embedding theorem on valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Arens and Eells proved that every metric space can be isometrically embedded into a normed linear space as a closed subset. In later years, in the paper on a short proof of the Arens--Eells theorem, Michael implicitly pointed out that the Arens--Eells theorem follows from the statement that every metric space can be isometrically embedded into a normed linear space as a linearly independent subset. In this paper, we prove a non-Archimedean analogue of the Arens--Eells isometric embedding theorem, which states that for every non-Archimedean valued field $K$, every ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into a non-Archimedean valued field that is a valued field extension of $K$ such that the image of the embedding is algebraically independent over $K$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of punctual Hilbert schemes on singular curves and their motivic zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06761v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Soma and Watari, we define a tree structure on certain subsemimodules of the semigroup $\Gamma$ associated with an irreducible plane curve singularity $(C,O)$. Building on results of Oblomkov, Rasmussen, and Shende, we show that for specific classes of singularities, this tree encodes key aspects of the geometry of the punctual Hilbert schemes of $(C,O)$. As an application, we compute the motivic Hilbert zeta function for a family of singular curves. \vskip 0.1cm A point in the Hilbert scheme corresponds to an ideal in the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{C,O}$ of the singularity. We study the stratification of these Hilbert schemes induced by constraints on the minimal number of generators of the defining ideals, and we describe geometric properties of these strata, including their dimension and closure relations.\vskip 0.1cm More importantly, we study their motivic zeta functions, particularly the motivic Hilbert zeta function, which encodes the classes of all punctual Hilbert schemes in the Grothendieck ring of varieties.</description>
