      <title>Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project I: Overview and Implementation of the Prototype Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field rapid sky surveys serve as critical observational methods for time-domain astronomical research. The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations. The experimental observation results of AT-Proto provide a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a time-domain astronomy observation array in Antarctica.</description>

      <title>Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project II: Data reduction and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Program is a time-domain optical sky survey project carried out in Antarctica, capable of large sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, and long-period staring. It utilizes the exceptional observing conditions in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence time-domain sky surveys. At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$\sigma$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>Connecting disc-corona physics and ionised outflows in AGN in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys aimed at connecting the physics of the accretion disc and X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the properties of their nebular regions and circumgalactic medium (CGM). We focus on the non-linear Lx-Luv relation and on deviations from this canonical coupling encoded in $\Delta \alpha_{OX}$, the offset of the optical-to-X-ray index from the mean relation, and propose to use broad and narrow line emission and CGM nebulae as calorimeters of the ionising SED to trace different accretion "states". We propose an observational strategy based on rest-frame UV/optical spectroscopy of $\sim 10^{4}-10^{5}$ AGN, a time-domain reverberation-mapping tier for a well-defined subsample, coordinated X-ray coverage, and wide-field IFU mapping of CGM emission (including H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$). From these goals we derive requirements for a future ESO facility in the 2040s: a dedicated, wide-field, high-multiplex optical-NIR spectroscopic telescope with time-domain flexibility and arcmin-scale IFU capability.</description>

      <title>From Nbody1 to Nbody7: the Growth of Sverres Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP). I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive.</description>

      <title>Picture an Astronomer: Best Practices for Retaining Talent in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Women are consistently underrepresented in astrophysics yet are simultaneously subject to disproportionate attrition at every career stage. This disparity between demonstrated efficacy in job performance and ultimate career outcome was the primary motivation for the Picture an Astronomer series, which included both targeted public outreach to increase representation of women in astrophysics and high-level, solution-oriented discussions among professional astronomers. In March 2025, more than 200 astronomers came together in a hybrid-format symposium focused on the state of the field for female scientists, combining scientific exchange with discussions of policies and practices to strengthen retention of talent in the field. This white paper is the result of those discussions, offering a wide range of recommendations developed in the context of gendered attrition in astrophysics but which ultimately support a healthier climate for all scientists alike.</description>

      <title>Nine years of UVIT: assessing sensitivity variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the five payloads onboard the first Indian multiwavelength astronomical observatory, AstroSat, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation on 28 September 2015. UVIT, designed for simultaneous imaging in the far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1300-1800 {\AA}) and near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2000-3000 {\AA}) channels, has completed nine years in orbit in 2024 despite the failure of the NUV channel in 2018. As the FUV optics is subject to possible reduction in sensitivity due to microscopic amounts of contaminants, we used the FUV data acquired by UVIT over the past nine years on the open cluster NGC 188 and the white dwarf HZ 4 to study sensitivity variations in the UVIT FUV channel. Our findings indicate no significant reduction in the sensitivity of the FUV channel over the last nine years, with no significant episodic variations due to unknown causes.</description>

      <title>Understanding Solar Flares and Energetic Events: Open questions, observational requirements, and instrumental needs over the coming decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are the largest energy-release events in the Solar System, allowing us to study fundamental physical phenomena under extreme conditions. Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to satellites, disruption to GPS, communications and power systems, and impacts on passenger air travel. A comprehensive understanding of solar flares is therefore not just a compelling science problem, but also important for national security and infrastructure. This white paper (WP) addresses critical open science questions related to solar flares. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK has a robust and vibrant solar flare community. We are key partners in international collaborations, and also provide instrumentation for existing and upcoming ESA/NASA/JAXA space missions. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field, achieve Solar System Advisory Panel roadmap goals, and to work under the UK Space Agency's National Space Strategy Pillars. Several complementary WPs have been submitted that discuss instruments or concepts that would directly address the observational requirements we describe (including: SPARK, solar optimised IFUs, Solar-C/EUVST, and OSIRIS), as well as required numerical modelling efforts and infrastructure.</description>

      <title>AstroReview: An LLM-driven Multi-Agent Framework for Telescope Proposal Peer Review and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.</description>

      <title>LUNCH: A Lightweight Unified Deep-Learning Framework for General Transients Classification in High-Energy Time-Domain Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing data volume of high-energy space monitors necessitates real-time, automated transient classification for multi-messenger follow-up. Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from raw multi-band light curves, eliminating the need for background subtraction or source localization. Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability. LUNCH combines high accuracy, low computational cost, and instrument-agnostic inputs, offering a practical solution for real-time in-flight processing that enables timely triggers for immediate multi-wavelength and multi-messenger follow-up observations in future time-domain missions.</description>

      <title>TTC: Transformer-based TDE Classifier for the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Transformer-based Tidal disruption events (TDE) Classifier (\texttt{TTC}), specifically designed to operate effectively with both real-time alert streams and archival data of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). It aims to minimize the reliance on external catalogs and find TDE candidates from pure light curves, which is more suitable for finding TDEs in faint and distant galaxies. \texttt{TTC} consists of two key modules that can work independently: (1) A light curve parametric fitting module and (2) a Transformer (\texttt{Mgformer})-based classification network. The training of the latter module and evaluation for each module utilize a light curve dataset of 7413 spectroscopically classified transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The \texttt{Mgformer}-based module is superior in performance and flexibility. Its representative recall and precision values are 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, and can be modified by adjusting the threshold. It can also efficiently find TDE candidates within 30 days from the first detection. For comparison, the parametric fitting module yields values of 0.72 and 0.40, respectively, while it is $&gt;$10 times faster in average speed. Hence, the setup of modules allows a trade-off between performance and time, as well as precision and recall. \texttt{TTC} has successfully picked out all spectroscopically identified TDEs among ZTF transients in a real-time classification test, and selected $\sim$20 TDE candidates in the deep field survey data of WFST. The discovery rate will greatly increase once the differential database for the wide field survey is ready.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Origins and Pathways of Ionizing Radiation Escape with UV Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Classification of Neutron-Star Matter Composition from Macroscopic and Oscillation Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic composition of neutron star interiors remains uncertain, with possible scenarios including nucleonic matter, hyperonic matter, dark matter admixed cores, and strange self-bound matter. Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Control and read-out of the HEPD-02 tracking system onboard CSES-02 satellite</title>

Abstract: The High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-02) is a payload of the second China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-02), designed and built by the Italian Limadou collaboration. Its purpose is to detect cosmic rays and trapped particles of radiation belts, in the kinetic energy range 3-100 MeV for electrons, 30-200 MeV for protons. HEPD-02 is the first space detector to use a tracking detector based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). The MAPS provides high spatial resolution, low noise, increased robustness, and low production costs. Operating MAPS in space presents a significant challenge due to strict power consumption requirements. To meet such constraints, a custom Tracker Data Acquisition (TDAQ) board and firmware have been designed and implemented, by using a commercial low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This paper addresses the design features of the TDAQ unit, enabling the tracking detector to be operated efficiently, with particular focus on the power consumption performance.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Anisotropies in PTA Observations: Analytical Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models build an effective representations of data that can be deployed on diverse downstream tasks. Previous research developed the OmniLearned foundation model for collider physics and showed that it could significantly advance discovery potential across collider experiments. In this paper we go beyond collider physics and show that Foundation Models trained on collider data can help improve the prediction of cosmological parameters and to predict halo and galaxy velocities in different datasets from CosmoBench. This is the first time a collider physics model is shown to generalize across scientific fields.</description>

      <title>The Redshifts from 122 Bands: Comparative Redshift Forecast for Low-Resolution Spectra from SPHEREx and 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently initiated SPHEREx and 7DS surveys will deliver low-resolution spectra ($R\approx 30-130$) for hundreds of millions of galaxies over the optical to near-infrared range ($0.4-5.0\mu m$), covering a wide sky area without sample selection. These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 &lt; i &lt; 18) galaxies, with $\sigma_{NMAD}\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets.</description>

      <title>RHINO: A large horn antenna for detecting the 21cm global signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sky-averaged brightness temperature of the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen provides a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, particularly before and during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation. This `global signal' is faint, on the order of tens to hundreds of millikelvin, and spectrally relatively smooth, making it exceedingly difficult to disentangle from foreground radio emission and instrumental artefacts. In this paper, we introduce RHINO, an experiment based around a large horn antenna operating from 60-85 MHz. Horn antennas are highly characterisable and provide excellent shielding from their immediate environment, which are potentially decisive advantages when it comes to the beam measurement and modelling problems that are particularly challenging for this kind of experiment. The system also includes a novel continuous wave calibration source to control correlated gain fluctuations, allowing continuous monitoring of the overall gain level without needing to rapidly switch between the sky and a calibration source. Here, we describe the basic RHINO concept, including the antenna design, EM simulations, and receiver electronics. We use a basic simulation and analysis pipeline to study the impact of the limited bandwidth on recovery of physical 21cm global signal model parameters, and discuss a basic calibration scheme that incorporates the continuous wave signal. Finally, we report on the current state of a scaled-down prototype system under construction at Jodrell Bank Observatory.</description>

      <title>XSPECT on-board XPoSat: Calibration and First Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: XPoSat is India's first X-ray spectro-polarimetry mission, consisting of two co-aligned instruments, a polarimeter (POLIX) and a spectrometer (XSPECT), to study the X-ray emission from celestial sources. Since polarimetry is a photon-hungry technique, the mission is designed to observe sources for long integration times (~ few days to weeks). This provides an unique opportunity, enabling XSPECT to carry out long-term monitoring of sources, and study their spectro-temporal evolution. To ensure that the instrument is able to fulfill its scientific objectives, it was extensively calibrated on-ground. Post launch, these calibrations were validated using on-board observations. Additionally, some aspects of the instrument such as alignment and effective area were also derived and fine-tuned from in-flight data. In this paper, we describe the calibration of XSPECT instrument in detail, including some initial results derived from its data to establish its capabilities.</description>

      <title>FITrig: A High-Performance Detection Technique for Efficient Ultra-Long-Period Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-long-period (ULP) pulsars, a newly identified class of celestial transients, offer unique insights into astrophysics, though very few have been detected to date. In radio astronomy, most time-domain detection methods cannot find these pulsars, and current image-based detection approaches still face challenges, including low sensitivity, high false positive rate, and low computational efficiency. In this article, we develop Fast Imaging Trigger (FITrig), a GPU-accelerated, statistics-based method for ULP pulsar detection and localisation. FITrig includes two complementary approaches -- an image domain and an image-frequency domain strategy. FITrig offers advantages by increasing sensitivity to faint pulsars, suppressing false positives (from noise, processing artefacts, or steady sources), and improving search efficiency in large-scale wide-field images. Compared to the state-of-the-art source finder SOFIA 2, FITrig increases the detection speed by 4.3 times for large images ($50\mathrm{K} \times 50\mathrm{K}$ pixels) and reduces false positives by up to 858.8 times (at 6$\sigma$ significance) for the image domain branch, while the image-frequency domain branch suppresses false positives even further. FITrig maintains the capability to detect pulsars that are 20 times fainter than surrounding steady features, even under critical Nyquist sampling conditions. In this article, the performance of FITrig is demonstrated using both real-world data (MeerKAT observations of PSR J0901-4046) and simulated datasets based on MeerKAT and SKA Array Assembly (AA) 2 telescope configurations. With its real-time processing capabilities and scalability, FITrig is a promising tool for next-generation telescopes, such as the SKA, with the potential to uncover hidden ULP pulsars.</description>

      <title>Closing the Evidence Gap: reddemcee, a Fast Adaptive Parallel Tempering Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) excels at sampling complex posteriors but traditionally lags behind nested sampling in accurate evidence estimation, which is crucial for model comparison in astrophysical problems. We introduce reddemcee, an Adaptive Parallel Tempering Ensemble Sampler, aiming to close this gap by simultaneously presenting next-generation automated temperature-ladder adaptation techniques and robust, low-bias evidence estimators. reddemcee couples an affine-invariant stretch move with five interchangeable ladder-adaptation objectives, Uniform Swap Acceptance Rate, Swap Mean Distance, Gaussian-Area Overlap, Small Gaussian Gap, and Equalised Thermodynamic Length, implemented through a common differential update rule. Three evidence estimators are provided: Curvature-aware Thermodynamic Integration (TI+), Geometric-Bridge Stepping Stones (SS+), and a novel Hybrid algorithm that blends both approaches (H+). Performance and accuracy are benchmarked on n-dimensional Gaussian Shells, Gaussian Egg-box, Rosenbrock Functions, and exoplanet radial-velocity time-series of HD 20794. Across Shells up to 15 dimensions, reddemcee presents roughly 7 times the effective sampling speed of the best dynamic nested sampling configuration. The TI+, SS+ and H+ estimators recover estimates under 3 percent error and supply realistic uncertainties with as few as six temperatures. In the HD 20794 case study, reddemcee reproduces literature model rankings and yields tighter yet consistent planetary parameters compared with dynesty, with evidence errors that track run-to-run dispersion. By unifying fast ladder adaptation with reliable evidence estimators, reddemcee delivers strong throughput and accurate evidence estimates, often matching, and occasionally surpassing, dynamic nested sampling, while preserving the rich posterior information which makes MCMC indispensable for modern Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>KDP as a thermal blocking filter -- Deep near IR observations with a warm narrow band filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based astronomy suffers from strong atmospheric line- and thermal continuum emission, at the near infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.1$\mu$m), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.1-2.5$\mu$m) wavelengths. The thermal continuum emission increases exponentially towards the red sensitivity cutoff of the state-of-the-art 2.5$\mu$m cutoff SWIR detectors. Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths &gt;2$\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1.191$\mu$m, and interpret it as the airglow continuum. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.</description>

      <title>Ricci-Notation Tensor Framework for Model-based Approaches to Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based approaches to imaging, like specialized image enhancements in astronomy, facilitate explanations of relationships between observed inputs and computed outputs. These models may be expressed with extended matrix-vector (EMV) algebra, especially when they involve only scalars, vectors, and matrices, and with n-mode or index notations, when they involve multidimensional arrays, also called numeric tensors or, simply, tensors. While this paper features an example, inspired by exoplanet imaging, that employs tensors to reveal (inverse) 2D fast Fourier transforms in an image enhancement model, the work is actually about the tensor algebra and software, or tensor frameworks, available for model-based imaging. The paper proposes a Ricci-notation tensor (RT) framework, comprising a dual-variant index notation, with Einstein summation convention, and codesigned object-oriented software, called the RTToolbox for MATLAB. Extensions to Ricci notation offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in EMV frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency via careful design of numeric tensor and dual-variant index classes. Compared to its closest competitor, also a numeric tensor framework that uses index notation, the RT framework enables superior ways to model imaging problems and, thereby, to develop solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) by re-analyzing the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C \rthis{from Fermi-GBM} using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $1\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.50}_{-0.37}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.85^{+0.84}_{-0.60}\times 10^{5}$ GeV for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively, and agree with the Bayesian estimates obtained so far in a previous work. Therefore, the results from the frequentist analysis of GRB 190114C agree with Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>EMPEROR I. Exoplanet MCMC parallel tempering for RV orbit retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present EMPEROR, an open-source Python framework designed for efficient exoplanet detection and characterisation with radial velocities (RV). EMPEROR integrates Dynamic Nested Sampling (DNS) and Adaptive Parallel Tempering (APT) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), supporting multiple noise models such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Moving Averages (MA). The framework enables systematic model comparison using statistical metrics, including Bayesian evidence ($\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while providing automated, publish-ready visualisations. EMPEROR is evaluated across three distinct systems to assess its capabilities in different detection scenarios. Sampling performance, model selection, and the search for Earth-mass planets are evaluated in data for 51 Pegasi, HD 55693 and Barnard's Star (GJ 699). For 51 Pegasi, APT achieves an effective sampling increase over DNS by a factor 3.76, while retrieving tighter parameter estimates. For HD 55693 the stellar rotation $P_{\text{rot}}=29.72^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and magnetic cycle $P_{\text{mag}}=2557.0^{+70.1}_{-36.7}$ are recovered, while demonstrating the sensitivity of $\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$ to prior selection. For Barnard's star, several noise models are compared, and the confirmed planet parameters are successfully retrieved with all of them. The best model shows a period of 3.1536$\pm$0.0003~d, minimum mass of 0.38$\pm$0.03 M$_{\rm{\oplus}}$, and semi-major axis of 0.02315$\pm$0.00039~AU. Purely statistical inference might be insufficient on its own for robust exoplanet detection. Effective methodologies must integrate domain knowledge, heuristic criteria, and multi-faceted model comparisons. The versatility of EMPEROR in handling diverse noise structures, its systematic model selection, and its improved performance make it a valuable tool for RV exoplanetary studies.</description>

Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</description>
