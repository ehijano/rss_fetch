      <title>Enhanced power enhancements for testing many moment equalities: Beyond the $2$- and $\infty$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests based on the $2$- and $\infty$-norm have received considerable attention in high-dimensional testing problems, as they are powerful against dense and sparse alternatives, respectively. The power enhancement principle of Fan et al. (2015) combines these two norms to construct tests that are powerful against both types of alternatives. Nevertheless, the $2$- and $\infty$-norm are just two out of the whole spectrum of $p$-norms that one can base a test on. In the context of testing whether a candidate parameter satisfies a large number of moment equalities, we construct a test that harnesses the strength of all $p$-norms with $p\in[2, \infty]$. As a result, this test consistent against strictly more alternatives than any test based on a single $p$-norm. In particular, our test is consistent against more alternatives than tests based on the $2$- and $\infty$-norm, which is what most implementations of the power enhancement principle target.
  We illustrate the scope of our general results by using them to construct a test that simultaneously dominates the Anderson-Rubin test (based on $p=2$) and tests based on the $\infty$-norm in terms of consistency in the linear instrumental variable model with many (weak) instruments.</description>

      <title>Starting Small: Prioritizing Safety over Efficacy in Randomized Experiments Using the Exact Finite Sample Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the exact finite sample likelihood and statistical decision theory to answer questions of ``why?'' and ``what should you have done?'' using data from randomized experiments and a utility function that prioritizes safety over efficacy. We propose a finite sample Bayesian decision rule and a finite sample maximum likelihood decision rule. We show that in finite samples from 2 to 50, it is possible for these rules to achieve better performance according to established maximin and maximum regret criteria than a rule based on the Boole-Frechet-Hoeffding bounds. We also propose a finite sample maximum likelihood criterion. We apply our rules and criterion to an actual clinical trial that yielded a promising estimate of efficacy, and our results point to safety as a reason for why results were mixed in subsequent trials.</description>

      <title>Simple subvector inference on sharp identified set in affine models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.00111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a regularized support function estimator for bounds on components of the parameter vector in the case in which the identified set is a polygon. The proposed regularized estimator has three important properties: (i) it has a uniform asymptotic Gaussian limit in the presence of flat faces in the absence of redundant (or overidentifying) constraints (or vice versa); (ii) the bias from regularization does not enter the first-order limiting distribution; (iii) the estimator remains consistent for sharp (non-enlarged) identified set for the individual components even in the non-regualar case. These properties are used to construct \emph{uniformly valid} confidence sets for an element $\theta_{1}$ of a parameter vector $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that is partially identified by affine moment equality and inequality conditions. The proposed confidence sets can be computed as a solution to a small number of linear and convex quadratic programs, leading to a substantial decrease in computation time and guarantees a global optimum. As a result, the method provides a uniformly valid inference in applications in which the dimension of the parameter space, $d$, and the number of inequalities, $k$, were previously computationally unfeasible ($d,k=100$). The proposed approach can be extended to construct confidence sets for intersection bounds, to construct joint polygon-shaped confidence sets for multiple components of $\theta$, and to find the set of solutions to a linear program. Inference for coefficients in the linear IV regression model with an interval outcome is used as an illustrative example.</description>
