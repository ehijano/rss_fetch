      <title>Generation of large-scale magnetic fields upstream of gamma-ray burst afterglow shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of the magnetic fields that power gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow emission are not fully understood. One possible channel for generating these fields involves the pre-conditioning of the circumburst medium: in the early afterglow phase, prompt photons streaming ahead of the GRB external shock can pair produce, seeding the upstream with drifting electron-positron pairs and triggering electromagnetic microinstabilities. To study this process, we employ 2D periodic particle-in-cell simulations in which a cold electron-proton plasma is gradually enriched with warm electron-positron pairs injected at mildly relativistic speeds. We find that continuous pair injection drives the growth of large-scale magnetic fields via filamentation-like instabilities; the temporal evolution of the field is self-similar and depends on a single parameter, $\left[\alpha/(t_f \omega_{pi})\right]^{1/2} t\omega_{pi}$, where $\alpha$ is the ratio of final pair beam density to background plasma density, $t_f$ is the duration of pair injection, and $\omega_{pi}$ is the plasma frequency of background protons. Extrapolating our results to parameter regimes realistic for long GRBs, we find that upstream pair enrichment generates weak magnetic fields on scales much larger than the proton skin depth; for bright bursts, the extrapolated coherence scale at a shock radius of $R \sim 10^{17}$ cm is $\left&lt;\lambda_y\right&gt; \sim 100 c/\omega_{pi}$ and the corresponding magnetization is $\sigma \sim 10^{-8}$ for typical circumburst parameters. These results may help explain the persistence of magnetic fields at large distances behind GRB shocks.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer in eccentric black hole - neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole - neutron star $(BH/NS)$ binaries are of interest in many ways: they are intrinsically multi-messenger systems, highly transient, radiate gravitational waves detectable by LIGO, and may produce $\gamma$-ray bursts. Although it has long been assumed that their late-stage orbital evolution is driven entirely by gravitational wave emission, we show here that in certain circumstances, mass transfer from the neutron star onto the black hole can both alter the binary's orbital evolution and significantly reduce the neutron star's mass when the fraction of its mass transferred per orbit is $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$, the neutron star's mass diminishes by order-unity, leading to mergers in which the neutron star mass is exceptionally small. The mass transfer creates a gas disk around the black hole ${\it before}$ merger that can be comparable in mass to the debris remaining after merger, i.e. $\sim 0.1 M_\odot$. These processes are most important when the initial neutron star/black hole mass ratio $q$ is in the range $\approx 0.2 - 0.8$, the orbital semimajor axis is $40 \lesssim a_0/r_g \lesssim 300 $ ($r_g \equiv GM_{\rm B}/c^2$), and the eccentricity is large, $e_0 \gtrsim 0.8$. Systems of this sort may be generated through the dynamical evolution of a triple system, as well as by other means.</description>

      <title>The Green Monster hiding in front of Cas A: JWST reveals a dense and dusty circumstellar structure pockmarked by ejecta interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations of the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A revealed an unexpected structure seen as a green emission feature in colored composite MIRI F1130W and F1280W images - hence dubbed the Green Monster - that stretches across the central parts of the remnant in projection. Combining the kinematic information from NIRSpec and MIRI MRS with the multi-wavelength imaging from NIRCam and MIRI, we associate the Green Monster with circumstellar material that was lost during an asymmetric mass-loss phase. MIRI images are dominated by dust emission but its spectra show emission lines from Ne, H and Fe with low radial velocities indicative of a CSM nature. An X-ray analysis of this feature in a companion paper (Vink et al. 2024) supports its CSM nature and detects significant blue shifting, thereby placing the Green Monster on the near side, in front of the Cas A SN remnant. The most striking features of the Green Monster are dozens of almost perfectly circular 1" - 3" sized holes, most likely created by interaction between high-velocity SN ejecta material and the CSM. Further investigation is needed to understand whether these holes were formed by small 8000-10500 km/s N-rich ejecta knots that penetrated and advanced out ahead of the remnant's 5000 - 6000 km/s outer blastwave, or by narrow ejecta fingers that protrude into the forward-shocked CSM. The detection of the Green Monster provides further evidence of the highly asymmetric mass-loss that Cas A's progenitor star underwent prior to explosion.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Accelerated by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), particles characterized by energies exceeding $10^{18}$ eV, are generally believed to be accelerated electromagnetically in high-energy astrophysical sources. One promising mechanism of UHECR acceleration is magnetized turbulence. We demonstrate from first principles, using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, that magnetically dominated turbulence accelerates particles on a short timescale, producing a power-law energy distribution with a rigidity-dependent, sharply defined cutoff well approximated by the form $f_{\rm cut}\left({E, E_{\rm cut}}\right) = {\text{sech}}\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\rm cut}}} )^2 \right]$. Particle escape from the turbulent accelerating region is energy-dependent, with $t_{\rm esc} \propto E^{-\delta}$ and $\delta \sim 1/3$. The resulting particle flux from the accelerator follows $dN/dEdt \propto E^{-s} {\text{sech}}\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\rm cut}}} )^2 \right]$, with $s \sim 2.1$. We fit the Pierre Auger Observatory's spectrum and composition measurements, taking into account particle interactions between acceleration and detection, and show that the turbulence-associated energy cutoff is well supported by the data, with the best-fitting spectral index being $s = 2.1^{+0.06}_{-0.13}$. Our first-principles results indicate that particle acceleration by magnetically dominated turbulence may constitute the physical mechanism responsible for UHECR acceleration.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos as a probe of espresso-shear acceleration in jets of Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Centaurus A (Cen A) could make a contribution to the observed ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) flux. We calculate the flux of astrophysical neutrinos produced by UHECRs accelerated in the jet of Cen A, a close-by jetted active galactic nucleus. We use a bottom-up approach, in which we follow the energization of protons and heavier elements in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a relativistic jet with proper parameters of Cen A, also accounting for attenuation losses based on the observed photon fields. We compare the expected neutrino flux with the sensitivity of current and planned neutrino detectors. We find that the detection of $\sim 10^{17}$-$10^{18}$ eV neutrinos from Cen A would require ultimate neutrino detectors that reach a point source sensitivity of $\sim {\rm a~few}\times10^{-13}~{\rm erg}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$. Successful detection, though challenging, would be useful in constraining the Cen A contribution to the UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Swiftly chasing gravitational waves across the sky in real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, dubbed `continuous commanding,' achieving 10 seconds latency response time on-orbit to unscheduled Target of Opportunity requests. This allows Swift to respond to early warning gravitational-wave detections, rapidly slewing the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) across the sky to place the GW origin in the BAT field of view at merger time. This will dramatically increase the GW/GRB co-detection rate, and enable prompt arcminute localization of a neutron star merger. We simulate the full Swift response to a GW early warning alert, including input sky maps produced at different warning times, a complete model of Swift's attitude control system, and a full accounting of the latency between the GW detectors and the spacecraft. 60 s of early warning doubles the rate of prompt GRB detections with arcminute position, and 140 s guarantees observation anywhere on the unocculted sky, even with localization areas &gt;&gt; 1000 deg$^2$. While 140 s is beyond current gravitational wave detector sensitivities, 30-70 s is achievable today. We show that the detection yield is now limited by the latency of LIGO/Virgo cyber-infrastructure, and motivate focus on its reduction. Continuous commanding is now a general capability of Swift, significantly increasing its versatility in response to the growing demands of time-domain astrophysics. We demonstrate this potential on an externally triggered Fast Radio Burst, slewing 81 degrees across the sky, and collecting X-ray and UV photons from the source position &lt; 150 s after the trigger was received from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), thereby setting the earliest and deepest such constraints on high energy activity from non-repeating FRBs. The Swift Team invites proposals for novel scientific applications of ultra-low latency UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optical to X-ray Spectra of OJ 287: Insights into X-ray spectral changes and particle spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OJ 287 is one of the most dynamic BL Lacertae objects that has exhibited behaviour representative of the entire blazar class and is also one of the best sources with simultaneous multi-wavelength coordinated data. Motivated by strong X-ray variability exhibited by the source, we systematically investigated the simultaneous optical to X-ray emission of the source with a focus on the spectral state of the lowest recorded X-ray flux state to understand the X-ray spectral changes. The optical-UV emission being synchrotron, the associated spectral variation is a direct reflection of the high-energy end of the underlying particle spectrum and its power-law continuation to X-rays can drastically affect the X-ray spectrum without much change in optical flux. Thus the combined optical to X-ray provides a potential tool to investigate and explore particle spectrum as well as highest particle energies. We report the finding of a power-law optical-UV spectrum with a photon spectral index of 2.71 $\pm$ 0.03 continuing to X-ray energies and accounting for this contribution at X-ray results in a photon spectral index of 1.15-1.3. We discuss the possible implications of this on X-ray spectral variations and the particle spectrum.</description>

      <title>Instability in supernova fallback disks and its effect on the formation of ultra long period pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several pulsars with unusually long periods were discovered recently, comprising a potential population of ultra long period pulsars (ULPPs). The origin of their long periodicity is not well understood, but may be related to magnatars spun down by surrounding fallback disks. While there are few systematic investigations on the fallback disk-assisted evolution of magnetars, the instability in the disk has received little attention, which determines the lifetime of the disk. In this work we simulate the evolution of the magnetic field, spin period, and magnetic inclination angle of magnetars with a supernova fallback disk. We find that thermal viscous instability in the disk could significantly affect the formation of ULPPs. Our simulation results also reveal that a large fraction of ULPPs seem to be nearly aligned and orthogonal rotators. This might help place ULPPs above the death line in the pulse period - period derivative plane. However, some extra mechanisms seem to be required to account for radio emission of ULPPs.</description>

      <title>On the diversity of strongly-interacting Type IIn supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars experience strong mass-loss, producing a dense, H-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). After the explosion, the collision and continued interaction of the supernova (SN) ejecta with the CSM power the light curve through the conversion of kinetic energy into radiation. When the interaction is strong, the light curve shows a broad peak and high luminosity lasting for a relatively long time. Also the spectral evolution is slower, compared to non-interacting SNe. Energetic shocks between the ejecta and the CSM create the ideal conditions for particle acceleration and production of high-energy (HE) neutrinos above 1 TeV. In this paper, we study four strongly-interacting Type IIn SNe: 2021acya, 2021adxl, 2022qml, and 2022wed to highlight their peculiar characteristics, derive the kinetic energy of the explosion and the characteristics of the CSM, infer clues on the possible progenitors and their environment and relate them to the production of HE neutrinos. The SNe analysed in this sample exploded in dwarf, star-forming galaxies and they are consistent with energetic explosions and strong interaction with the surrounding CSM. For SNe 2021acya and 2022wed, we find high CSM masses and mass-loss rates, linking them to very massive progenitors. For SN 2021adxl, the spectral analysis and less extreme CSM mass suggest a stripped-envelope massive star as possible progenitor. SN 2022qml is marginally consistent with being a Type Ia thermonuclear explosion embedded in a dense CSM. The mass-loss rates for all SNe are consistent with the expulsion of several solar masses of material during eruptive episodes in the last few decades before the explosion. Finally, we find that the SNe in our sample are marginally consistent with HE neutrino production.</description>

      <title>On the External Inverse Compton Scattering off the Prompt Emission in GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light curve of the TeV emission in GRB 221009A displays a smooth transition from an initial rapid rise to a slower rise and eventually a decay phase. The smooth temporal profile of the TeV emission suggests that it mainly results from an external shock. The temporal overlap between the prompt KeV-MeV emission and the early TeV afterglow indicates that external inverse Compton scattering (EIC) between the prompt KeV-MeV photons and the afterglow electrons is inevitable. Since the energy density of the prompt emission is much higher than that of the afterglow during the early phase, the EIC process dominates the cooling of afterglow electrons. The EIC scattering rate is influenced by the anisotropy of the seed photon field, which depends on the radii of the internal dissipation ($R_{\rm dis}$), where the prompt emission is produced, and that of the external shock ($R_{\rm ext}$), where the afterglow emission is produced. We investigate the EIC process for different values of $R_{\rm dis}/R_{\rm ext}$. We find that, for varying \( R_{\rm dis}/R_{\rm ext} \), the EIC scattering rate can differ by a factor of $\sim 2$. For GRB 221009A, the EIC emission is dominated during the early rising phase of the TeV afterglow. It then transitions to a phase dominated by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission as the intensity of the prompt emission decreases. Additionally, we investigate the effect of $\gamma \gamma$ absorption in the TeV afterglow caused by prompt MeV photons and find that it is insufficient to explain the early rapid rise in the TeV afterglow, even in the case of $R_{\rm dis}/R_{\rm ext} \sim 1$.</description>

      <title>The stress at the ISCO of black-hole accretion discs is not a free parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation from the "plunging region" (the space between the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the black-hole (BH) surface) of an accretion flow onto a BH is supposed to add a small but significant contribution to the X-ray spectra of X-ray binary systems. The plunging region and its electromagnetic emission has been recently described by numerical and analytic calculations which lead to the conclusion that in the plunging region radiation is generated by the energy release through the action of a "leftover" stress in the vicinity of the ISCO and that the amount of this leftover can be chosen as a free parameter of the accretion-flow description. The present article aims to demonstrate that this is not true because the stress in the whole accretion flow onto a black hole is determined by its global transonic character enforced by the space-time structure of the accreting black hole. We use the slim-disc approximation (SDA) to illustrate this point. In our article we compare models obtained with the SDA with results of numerical simulations and of analytical models based on the assumption that accreting matter flows along geodesics. We show that the latter cannot describe adequately the physics of astrophysical accretion onto a BH because 1. particles on geodesics cannot emit electromagnetic radiation, 2. they ignore the global transonic character of the accretion flow imposed by the presence of a stationary horizon in the BH spacetime; a presence that fixes a unique value of the angular momentum at the BH surface for a solution to exist. Therefore the fact that geodesics-based models reproduce the trans-ISCO behaviour of GRRMHD simulations proves the physical reality of neither. We show also that the claimed detection of plunging-region emission in the spectrum of an X-ray binary is unsubstantiated.</description>

      <title>Spectral Insights and Timing Analysis of X-ray Bursts in EXO 0748-676: A NuSTAR Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray bursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's FPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray bursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface, notably a significant burst at \(X = 18,479.97\), indicating rapid energy release, followed by a recoil burst at \(X = 19,463.97\), reflecting stabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's optical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion dynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \( \Gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.014 \) and a cutoff energy of \( E_C = 36.20 \pm 1.04 \; \text{keV} \), indicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of approximately \( (381.17 \pm 0.014) \times 10^{-12} \; \text{erg cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1} \) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems. Calculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \( (3.86 \pm 0.239) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \) to \( (2.3 \pm 0.177) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission characteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in 2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.) reveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our understanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate models describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future investigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution processes in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Searching for Radio Transients with Inverted Spectra in Epoch 1 of VLASS and VCSS, and Identification of a Sample of Candidate Relativistic Nuclear Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For radio transients, an inverted spectrum (defined as $\alpha &gt; 0$ for a power law spectrum $S_{\nu}\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) constrains physical properties, which in principle can be a useful criterion for selecting specific targets of interest in a transient search. To test and develop this concept, we have searched epoch 1 of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS; 3.0 GHz) and the VLITE Commensal Sky Survey (VCSS; 340 MHz) for radio transients with inverted spectra. We discover a sample of 22 inverted-spectra transient candidates that are not associated with cataloged active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To the best of our knowledge, none of our candidates have transient counterparts at other wavelengths, and only one has previously been reported as a radio transient. We find that our candidates evolve slowly over years and show either highly inverted spectra or peaked spectra over $\sim$1--3 GHz. Within our sample, nine candidates are matched to optical centers of galaxies and have estimated radio spectral luminosities of $L_{3.0\mathrm{GHz}}\sim10^{30}-10^{33}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$. Based on the observed properties, we find the most plausible transient classification for our candidates to be relativistic tidal disruption events. However, we are unable to fully rule out variable or transient AGNs with highly inverted spectra. Upon examining physical constraints, we confirm that mainly relativistic transients (on-axis or off-axis) with equipartition energy $E_{\mathrm{eq}}\gtrsim10^{49}-10^{53}\,\mathrm{erg}$ are expected from searching VLASS and VCSS based on inverted spectra. The obtainable physical constraints, however, can be weak due to degeneracy introduced by viewing angle.</description>

      <title>On the impact of neutrinos on the launching of relativistic jets from "magnetars" produced in neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant interest has emerged recently in assessing whether collimated and ultra-relativistic outflows can be produced by a long-lived remnant from a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger, with different approaches leading to different outcomes. To clarify some of the aspect of this process, we report the results of long-term (\ie $\sim~110\,{\rm ms}$) state-of-the-art general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the inspiral and merger of a BNS system of magnetized stars. We find that after $\sim~50\,{\rm ms}$ from the merger, an $\alpha$-$\Omega$~dynamo driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) sets-in in the densest regions of the disk and leads to the breakout of the magnetic-field lines from the accretion disk around the remnant. The breakout, which can be associated with the violation of the Parker-stability criterion, is responsible for the generation of a collimated, magnetically-driven outflow with only mildly relativistic velocities that is responsible for a violent eruption of electromagnetic energy. We provide evidence that this outflow is partly collimated via a Blandford-Payne mechanism driven by the open field lines anchored in the inner disk regions. Finally, by including or not the radiative transport via neutrinos, we determine the role they play in the launching of the collimated wind. In this way, we conclude that the mechanism of magnetic-field breakout we observe is robust and takes place even without neutrinos. Contrary to previous expectations, the inclusion of neutrinos absorption and emission leads to a smaller baryon pollution in polar regions, and hence accelerates the occurrence of the breakout, yielding a larger electromagnetic luminosity. Given the mildly relativistic nature of these disk-driven breakout outflows, it is difficult to consider them responsible for the jet phenomenology observed in short gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>An X-ray Shell Reveals the Supernova Explosion for Galactic Microquasar SS 433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How black holes are formed remains an open and fundamental question in Astrophysics. Despite theoretical predictions, it lacks observations to understand whether the black hole formation experiences a supernova explosion. Here we report the discovery of an X-ray shell north of the Galactic micro-quasar SS 433 harboring a stellar-mass black hole spatially associated with radio continuum and polarization emissions, and an HI cloud. Its spectrum can be reproduced by a 1-keV under-ionized plasma, from which the shell is inferred to have been created by a supernova explosion 20-30 kyr ago and its properties constitute evidence for canonical SN explosions to create some black holes. Our analysis precludes other possible origins including heated by jets or blown by disk winds. According to the lower mass limit of the compact object in SS 433, we roughly deduced that the progenitor should be more massive than 25 M$_{\odot}$. The existence of such a young remnant in SS 433 can also lead to new insights into the supercritical accretion in young microquasars and the ${\gamma}$-ray emission of this system. The fallback ejecta may provide accretion materials within tens of thousands of years while the shock of the supernova remnant may play a crucial role in the cosmic ray (re)acceleration.</description>

      <title>Tracking the jet-like corona of black hole Swift J1727.8-1613 during a flare state through Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in black hole X-ray transients typically manifest in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states. This study presents a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of the black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 using NICER observations from August and September 2023, with a focus on the first flare period. The time-averaged spectra, along with the rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPOs, were jointly fitted using the time-dependent Comptonization model \text{vkompthdk} to examine the geometry of the corona during this flare. The results provide a comprehensive view of the QPO, where we detected type-C QPOs with a centroid frequency increasing from 0.32 Hz to 2.63 Hz, while it elevated when it entered the flare state, and its energy spectral properties as they evolved during the first flare period. Correlations between spectral and temporal properties suggest that type-C QPOs are primarily modulated by Lense-Thirring precession. Based on simultaneous radio observations indicating discrete jet ejections, we propose, for the first time, a scenario where the temporarily extended corona contracts vertically from approximately 2714 km to less than 900 km, overlying the inner accretion disc, with a transient jet seemingly being launched. The corona then recovers to nearly 2000 km by the end of the first flare period of Swift J1727.8-1613, rather than undergoing horizontal changes. A phenomenological analysis of the corona scenario during this flare period was also conducted.</description>

      <title>Microquasars to AGNs: An uniform Jet variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term variability study over a range of black hole (BH) mass systems from the microquasars of stellar-mass black holes to the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) of supermassive black holes, in $\gamma$-rays offers new insights into the physics of relativistic jets. In this work, we investigate the $\gamma$-ray variability of 11 AGNs--including 7 blazars, 2 unclassified blazar candidates (BCUs), 1 radio galaxy (RG), and 1 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) as well as 2 microquasars. We apply a stochastic process known as the Damped Random Walk (DRW) to model the $\sim$15 years of Fermi-LAT light curves. The characteristic timescales observed for AGNs are comparable to those in the accretion disc. Interestingly, the timescales observed in the jet emission of microquasars are similar to those of AGNs, suggesting uniform jet properties across the black hole masses. The observed rest-frame timescales of AGNs overlap with both thermal and non-thermal timescales associated with the jet and accretion disk, respectively, suggesting a scaled relationship between $\tau_{DRW}^{rest}$ and black hole mass ($\rm{M_{BH}}$). While the timescales observed for microquasars deviate significantly from this relationship, nonetheless exhibit a scaled $\tau_{DRW}^{rest}-\rm{M_{BH}}$ relationship using $\gamma$-rays specifically. These findings offer new insights into the origin of jets and the processes driving the emission within them. Additionally, this study hints at a new perspective that the relativistic jets' properties or their production mechanisms may be independent of the black hole mass.</description>

      <title>Systematic collapse of the accretion disc in AGN confirmed by UV photometry and broad line spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN combined unobscured X-ray sources from the eROSITA eFEDS Survey with high quality optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The HSC data enabled accurate host galaxy subtraction as well as giving a uniform black hole mass estimator from the stellar mass. The resulting stacked optical/X-ray SEDs for black holes at fixed mass show a dramatic transition, where the dominating disc component in bright AGN evaporates into an X-ray hot plasma below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. The models fit to these datasets predicted the largest change in SED in the rest frame UV ($&lt; 3000\,\r{A}$), but this waveband was not included in the original study. Here we use archival $u$-band and UV photometry to extend the SEDs into this range, and confirm the UV is indeed intrinsically faint in AGN below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ as predicted. This dramatic drop in UV photo-ionising flux is also seen from its effect on the broad emission lines. We stack the recently released SDSS DR18 optical spectra for this sample, and show that the broad H$\beta$ line disappears along with the UV bright component at $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. This shows that there is a population of unobscured, X-ray bright, UV faint AGN which lack broad emission lines (true type 2 Seyferts).</description>

      <title>Hidden by a star: the redshift and the offset broad line of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 0903-57</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: PKS 0903-57 is a little-studied gamma-ray blazar which has recently attracted considerable interest due to the strong flaring episodes observed since 2020 in HE (100 MeV &lt; E &lt; 100 GeV) and VHE (100 GeV &lt; E &lt; 10 TeV) gamma-rays. Its nature and properties are still not well determined. In particular, it is unclear whether PKS 0903-57 is a BL Lac or a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), while its redshift estimation relies on a possibly misassociated low signal-to-noise spectrum. Aim: We aim to reliably measure the redshift of the blazar and to determine its spectral type and luminosity in the optical range. Methods: We performed spectroscopy of the optical counterpart of the blazar using the South African Large Telescope (SALT) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and monitored it photometrically with the Rapid Eye Mount (REM) telescope. Results: We firmly measured the redshift of the blazar as z= 0.2621 +/- 0.0006 thanks to the detection of five narrow optical lines. The detection of a symmetric broad Halpha line with Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 4020 +/- 30 km/s together with a jet-dominated continuum leads us to classify it as a FSRQ. Finally, we detected with high significance a redshift offset (about 1500 km/s) between the broad line and the host. This is the first time that such an offset is unequivocally detected in a VHE blazar, possibly pointing to a very peculiar accretion configuration, a merging system, or a recoiling Black Hole.</description>

      <title>Magnetic coupling through flux branching of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner and outer cores of neutron stars are believed to contain type-I and -II proton superconductors, respectively. The type-I superconductor exists in an intermediate state, comprising macroscopic flux-free and flux-containing regions, while the type-II superconductor is flux-free, except for microscopic, quantized flux tubes. Here, we show that the inner and outer cores are coupled magnetically, when the macroscopic flux tubes subdivide dendritically into quantized flux tubes, a phenomenon called flux branching. An important implication is that up to $\sim 10^{12} (r_1/10^6 \, {\rm cm}) \, {\rm erg}$ of energy are required to separate a quantized flux tube from its progenitor macroscopic flux tube, where $r_1$ is the length of the macroscopic flux tube. Approximating the normal-superconducting boundary as sharp, we calculate the magnetic coupling energy between a quantized and macroscopic flux tube due to flux branching as a function of, $f_1$, the radius of the type-I inner core divided by the radius of the type-II outer core. Strong coupling delays magnetic field decay in the type-II superconductor. For an idealised inner core containing only a type-I proton superconductor and poloidal flux, and in the absence of ambipolar diffusion and diamagnetic screening, the low magnetic moments ($\lesssim 10^{27} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$) of recycled pulsars imply $f_1 \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the Gamma Ray Burst photospheric emission: Monte Carlo simulation of the GRB prompt emission, numerical results and discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a detailed study of the GRB photospheric emission model predicting a quasi-blackbody spectrum slightly broader than a Planck function. This model was suggested within the relativistic fireball dynamics for interpreting a still not well understood thermal component in the GRB prompt emission, recently observed by the GBM on board the Fermi space telescope. We propose a Monte Carlo (M C) code for elucidating the observed spectrum, the outflow dynamics and its geometry for a basic and a structured plasma jets whose parameters are implemented. The code involves a simulation part describing the photon propagation assuming an unpolarized, non-dissipative relativistic outflow and a data analysis part for exploring main photospheric emission properties such as the energy, arrival time and observed flux of the simulated seed photons and the photospheric radius. Computing the latter two observables by numerical integration, we obtained values very concordant with the M C simulated results. Fitting Band functions to the photon spectra generated by this method, we derived best-fit values of the photon indices matching well those featuring the observed spectra for most typical GRBs, but corresponding to fit functions inconciliable with blackbody spectral shapes. Various derived results are reported, compared to previous ones and discussed. They show to be very sensitive to the structure of the Lorentz factor that plays a crucial role in determining the presence and strength of geometrical effects. The latter manifest themselves by large broadenings of the simulated spectra featured by multiple peak energies consistently with GRB observations. They are assumed, with multiple Compton scattering, to produce bumps pointed out at very low photon energies. Finally, developments of this work are put into perspective.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Optical Convergence: Extragalactic Background Light from TeV Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensity of the extragalactic background (EBL), the accumulated optical and infrared emissions since the first stars, is the subject of a decades-long tension in the optical band. These photons form a target field that attenuates the $\gamma$-ray flux from extragalactic sources. This paper reports the first $\gamma$-ray measurement of the EBL spectrum at $z=0$ that is purely parametric and independent of EBL evolution with redshift, over a wavelength range from $0.18$ to $120\,\mu$m. Our method extracts the EBL absorption imprint on more than 260 archival TeV spectra from the STeVECat catalog, by marginalizing nuisance parameters describing the intrinsic emission and instrumental uncertainties. We report an intensity at 600 nm of $6.9 \pm 1.9$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}\,\times\, h_{70}$, which is indistinguishable from the intensity derived from integrated galaxy light (IGL) and compatible with direct measurements taken beyond Pluto's orbit. We exclude with $95\,\%$ confidence diffuse contributions to the EBL with an intensity relative to the IGL, $f_\mathrm{diff}$, greater than $20\,\%$ and provide a measurement of the expansion rate of the universe at $z=0$, $H_0 = 67^{+7}_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}\,\times\, (1+f_\mathrm{diff})$, which is EBL-model independent. IGL, direct and $\gamma$-ray measurements agree on the EBL intensity in the optical band, finally reaching a cosmological optical convergence.</description>

      <title>Probing blackbody components in gamma-ray bursts from black hole neutrino-dominated accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is generally considered to be the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Neutrinos escaping from the disk will annihilate out of the disk to produce the fireball that could power GRBs with blackbody (BB) components. The initial GRB jet power and fireball launch radius are related to the annihilation luminosity and annihilation height of the NDAFs, respectively. In this paper, we collect 7 GRBs with known redshifts and identified BB components to test whether the NDAF model works. We find that, in most cases, the values of the accretion rates and the central BH properties are all in the reasonable range, suggesting that these BB components indeed originate from the neutrino annihilation process.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sharing Timescale in an Analytic Framework for Common Envelope Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new predictive theory for the analysis of common envelope (CE) events which incorporates the effects of relevant hydrodynamical processes into a simple analytical framework. We introduce the ejection and dynamical parameters $\xi$ and $\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is energetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral. When combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral begins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to 3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts predictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess, and offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary population synthesis.</description>

      <title>Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes as Astrophysical Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, stating that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly significant in systems with a high capacity for information storage such as black holes. In these systems, the evaporation process is halted, at the latest, after approximately half of the black hole's initial mass has been radiated away. Consequently, light primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,$g, which are expected to have fully evaporated by present time, may remain viable candidates for dark matter (DM). In this scenario, we demonstrate that their mergers would continue to occur today, leading to the formation of ``young'' black holes that resume evaporating, producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detectable by current experiments. The emission spectrum would be thermal in all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinguishable signature. Current measurements of the isotropic neutrino flux at Earth are in tension with light PBHs as DM candidates within the mass range $7\times10^3\lesssim m_{\rm PBH}/{\rm g}\lesssim 4\times 10^8$, if neutrinos are of Majorana nature. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observations, as well as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical and Cosmological Probes of Boosted Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth study of two-component cold dark matter via extensive N-body simulations. We examine various cosmological observables including the temperature evolution, power spectrum, density perturbation, maximum circular velocity functions, and galactic density profiles. We find that a significant mass difference between the two components, coupled with the annihilation of the heavier into the lighter component, imparts warm dark matter (WDM)-like characteristics to the latter. This model benefits from the unique features of WDM, such as modifications to the matter power spectrum and density profiles, while avoiding stringent observational constraints on WDM mass. The two-component dark-matter model aligns with observational data and suggests new avenues for dark-matter detection in terrestrial experiments, particularly for light, sub-MeV DM candidates. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the small-scale structures and offer guidance for future particle physics and cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Direct current memory effects in effective-one-body waveform models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct current (DC) memory is a non-oscillatory, hereditary component of the gravitational wave (GW) signal that represents one of the most peculiar manifestations of the nonlinear nature of GW emission and propagation. In this work, by transforming the results provided in Ebersold et al. [Phys.Rev.D 100 (2019) 8, 084043] in harmonic coordinates and quasi-Keplerian parametrization, we provide the DC memory in terms of the effective-one-body (EOB) phase-space variables, with a relative accuracy of 2.5PN and in an expansion for small eccentricity up to order six. Our results are then implemented in TEOBResumS-Dal\'i, thus providing the first EOB model with DC memory contributions. This model is then used to assess the impact on the waveform and the main features of the DC memory, also addressing its dependence on the eccentricity of the binary system at its formation.</description>

      <title>Comparison between the emission torus and the measured toroidal magnetic field for the Crab and Vela nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, where as the Vela nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Charge ratio of cosmic ray muons in momentum range ~ 1 to 3 GeV/c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the measurements of the cosmic muon charge ratio as a function of full azimuthal angle and momentum within the range of 0.8 to 3.0 GeV/c, using the mini-ICAL detector. The detector, comprising 10 layers of RPCs, has collected cosmic muon data since August 2018 till recent time, at an altitude of 160 m above sea level at the Inter-Institutional Center for High Energy Physics in Madurai, India $(9^\circ56'\,N, 78^\circ00'\,E)$. The muon charge identification is achieved through the use of a magnetic field of strength 1.4 T. The analysis shows that the cosmic muon charge ratio, $R_\mu = N_{\mu^+}/N_{\mu^-}$, ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 and has small dependency on the zenith angle. The charge ratio's dependence on momentum and azimuthal angle is thoroughly examined for a wide range of zenith angle upto $50^\circ$. These measurements are compared with the predictions from various combinations of different hadronic models in CORSIKA extensive air shower simulations.</description>

      <title>Collisional and Radiative Data for Tellurium ions in Kilonovae modelling and Laboratory Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tellurium is a primary candidate for the identification of the 2.1 $\mu$m emission line in kilonovae (KNe) spectra AT2017gfo and GRB230307A. Despite this, there is currently an insufficient amount of atomic data available for this species. We calculate the required atomic structure and collisional data, particularly the data required for accurate Non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (NLTE) modelling of the low temperatures and densities in KNe. We use a Multi-Configurational-Dirac-Hartree-Fock method to produce optimised one-electron orbitals for Te {\sc i}-{\sc iii}.
  As a result energy levels and Einstein A-coefficients for Te {\sc i}-{\sc iii} have been calculated. These orbitals are then employed within Dirac $R$-matrix collision calculations to provide electron-impact-excitation collision strengths that were subsequently averaged according to a thermal Maxwellian distribution. Subsequent \textsc{tardis} simulations using this new atomic data reveal no significant changes to the synthetic spectra due to the very minor contribution of Te at early epochs. NLTE simulations with the ColRadPy package reveal optically thin spectra consistent with the increasing prominence of the Te {\sc iii} 2.1 $\mu$m line as the KNe ejecta cools. This is reinforced by the estimation of luminosities at nebular KNe conditions. New line ratios for both observation and laboratory benchmarks of the atomic data are proposed.</description>

      <title>The ground calibration of the HERMES-Pathfinder payload flight models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HERMES-Pathfinder is a space-borne mission based on a constellation of six nano-satellites flying in a low-Earth orbit. The 3U CubeSats, to be launched in early 2025, host miniaturized instruments with a hybrid Silicon Drift Detector/scintillator photodetector system, sensitive to both X-rays and gamma-rays. A seventh payload unit is installed onboard SpIRIT, an Australian-Italian nano-satellite developed by a consortium led by the University of Melbourne and launched in December 2023. The project aims at demonstrating the feasibility of Gamma-Ray Burst detection and localization using miniaturized instruments onboard nano-satellites. The HERMES flight model payloads were exposed to multiple well-known radioactive sources for spectroscopic calibration under controlled laboratory conditions. The analysis of the calibration data allows both to determine the detector parameters, necessary to map instrumental units to accurate energy measurements, and to assess the performance of the instruments. We report on these efforts and quantify features such as spectroscopic resolution and energy thresholds, at different temperatures and for all payloads of the constellation. Finally we review the performance of the HERMES payload as a photon counter, and discuss the strengths and the limitations of the architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars change their structure with accumulation of dark matter. We study how their mass is influenced from the environment. Close to the sun, the dark matter accretion from the neutron star does not have any effect on it. Moving towards the galactic center, the density increase in dark matter results in increased accretion. At distances of some fraction of a parsec, the neutron star acquire enough dark matter to have its structure changed. We show that the neutron star mass decreases going towards the galactic centre, and that dark matter accumulation beyond a critical value collapses the neutron star into a black hole. Calculations cover cases varying the dark matter particle mass, self-interaction strength, and ratio between the pressure of dark matter and ordinary matter. This allow us to constrain the interaction cross section, $\sigma_{\rm dm}$, between nucleons and dark matter particles, as well as the dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf, one of the compact objects in the universe, is not only pivotal for astrophysical inquiries but also furnishes a dynamic arena for nuclear physics exploration. In this work, we extend the relativistic mean field approach using a Walecka-type quantum hadrodynamics model to encapsulate the intricate structure of white dwarfs. This methodological advancement facilitates a cohesive analysis of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and the nuclear pasta within a unified theoretical framework. By meticulously calibrating the model parameters to nuclear matter properties, we successfully replicate the structures of various nuclei, such as \(^{4}\rm He\), isotopes of \(\rm C\), and \(^{16}\rm O\). Subsequently, we predict the properties of white dwarfs composed of atom-like units and the gravitational waves stemming from binary white dwarf inspirals incorporating tidal deformability contributions up to the 2.5 post-Newtonian order. These results shed light on the structure of white dwarfs and offer more clues for future gravitational wave detection.</description>

Abstract: Analyses of major group mergers are key to understanding the evolution of large-scale structure in the Universe and the microphysical properties of the hot gas in these systems. We present imaging and spectral analyses of deep Chandra observations of hot gas structures formed in the major merger of the NGC 7618 and UGC 12491 galaxy groups and compare the observed hot gas morphology, temperatures, and abundances with recent simulations. The morphology of the observed multiple cold front edges and boxy wings are consistent with those expected to be formed by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and gas sloshing in inviscid gas. The arc-shaped slingshot tail morphologies seen in each galaxy suggest that the dominant galaxies are near their orbital apogee after having experienced at least one core passage at a large impact parameter.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases in parametrized tests of general relativity due to waveform mismodeling: the impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters) such that we are led to falsely identify a GR deviation due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the non-GR and GR models, and the fitting factor of the non-GR model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the non-GR parameter, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the non-GR model (over the GR model). At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the non-GR model (over the GR model) and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we explicitly connect different measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that are generally applicable to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Two waves of massive stars running away from the young cluster R136</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are predominantly born in stellar associations or clusters. Their radiation fields, stellar winds, and supernovae strongly impact their local environment. In the first few million years of a cluster's life, massive stars are dynamically ejected running away from the cluster at high speed. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Astrometric analysis with Gaia reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We find that 23-33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic medium, along with their role in driving galactic outflows, is far more important than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Anisotropic Neutron Stars with a Parametrized Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of anisotropy on slowly rotating neutron stars by extending the Hartle-Thorne formalism in general relativity to include anisotropy in pressure up to second order in the angular velocity. We assess the presence of anisotropy within the star by employing a quasi-local relationship. Our results show that the ratio between the gravitational mass of the fastest anisotropic rotating configurations and the corresponding non-rotating ones ranges from $1.12$ to $1.25$, consistent with recent findings. We develop universal relations for the moment of inertia, binding energy, and quadrupole moment of the rotating stars. These relations are tested against various equations of state, which were modeled by a piecewise polytropic function with continuous sound speed.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytic Love-C Relations for Neutron Stars</title>

Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star observables (such as mass and radius) allow one to constrain the equations of state for supranuclear matter and develop a stronger understanding of nuclear physics. The Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) tracks X-ray hotspots on rotating NSs and is able to infer precise information about the compactness of the star. Gravitational waves carry information about the tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) of neutron stars, which has been measured by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration. These two observables enjoy an approximately universal property between each other that is insensitive to the equations of state (the "universal Love-C relation"). In this paper, we focus on deriving two analytic expressions for the Love-C relations that are ready-to-use and improve upon previous analytic expressions. The first model is inspired by a Newtonian polytrope, whose perturbation to the gravitational potential can be found analytically. We extend this Newtonian model to the relativistic regime by providing a quadratic fit to the gravitational potential perturbation against stellar compactness. The second model makes use of the Tolman VII model and adopts a spectral expansion with Chebyshev polynomials, which converges faster than the Taylor expansions used in previous work. We find that the first model provides a more accurate description of the Love-C relation for realistic neutron stars than the second model, and it provides the best expression among all other analytic relations studied here in terms of describing the averaged numerical Love-C relation. These new models are not only useful in practice, but they also show the power and importance of analytic modeling of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of The Brightest Nano-size Gamma Source</title>

Abstract: Gamma rays consist of high-energy photons that selectively interact with nuclei, induce and mediate nuclear reactions and elementary particle interactions, and exceed x-rays in penetrating power and thus are indispensable for analysis and modification of dense or compressed object interior. Yet, the available gamma sources lack power and brightness which, if available, would revolutionize science and technology. The predicted laser-driven Gamma Flash (GF) would be the highest-power and the brightest terrestrial gamma source with a 30-40% laser-to-gamma energy conversion. It is based on inverse Compton scattering in a laser-solid interaction at irradiance typically above $10^{23}W/cm^2$. GF is one of the motivating goals for the most advanced laser facilities. However, till now GF remains overshadowed by simultaneously generated low-brightness Bremsstrahlung. Here we experimentally differentiate these two mechanisms and demonstrate a GF dominant regime producing several times the number of Bremsstrahlung photons. We found steep GF yield growth with the laser power and irradiance. Simulations revealed a Terawatt GF with nanometre source and an attosecond pulse train with a record brightness of $~10^{22}photons/mm^2mrad^2s0.1\%BW$ at up to tens of MeV. The small source size and high brightness paves the way towards spatially coherent gamma rays. At high photon energies, our regime is comparable in brightness to astrophysical Gamma Ray Bursts. We anticipate that the gamma ray source based on our findings will facilitate a breakthrough in research on future inertial fusion energy by enabling high-spatial-resolution time-resolved radiography of fuel mixing instabilities in extremely compressed targets. Such a new compact bright ultrafast gamma source could facilitate significant advances in time-resolved nuclear physics, homeland security, and nuclear waste management and non-proliferation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray-Driven Galactic Winds with Resolved ISM and Ion-Neutral Damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback processes in galaxies dictate their structure and evolution. Baryons can be cycled through stars, which inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in supernova explosions, fueling multiphase galactic winds. Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at supernova remnants are an important component of feedback. CRs can effectively contribute to wind driving; however, their impact heavily depends on the assumed CR transport model. We run high-resolution "tallbox" simulations of a patch of a galactic disk using the moving mesh magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO, including varied CR implementations and the CRISP non-equilibrium thermochemistry model. We characterize the impact of CR feedback on star formation and multiphase outflows. While CR-driven winds are able to supply energy to a global-scale wind, a purely thermal wind loses most of its energy by the time it reaches 3 kpc above the disk midplane. We further find that the adopted CR transport model significantly affects the steady-state of the wind. In the model with CR advection, streaming, diffusion, and nonlinear Landau damping, CRs provide very strong feedback. Additionally accounting for ion-neutral damping (IND) decouples CRs from the cold ISM, which reduces the impact of CRs on the star formation rate. Nevertheless, CRs in this most realistic model are able to accelerate warm gas and levitate cool gas in the wind but have little effect on cold gas and hot gas. This model displays moderate mass loading and significant CR energy loading, demonstrating that IND does not prevent CRs from providing effective feedback.</description>

      <title>$\mu$-GLANCE: A Novel Technique to Detect Chromatically and Achromatically Lensed Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing occurs when the Schwarzschild radius of the lensing object is smaller or nearly equal to the wavelength of the incoming waves and can produce a chromatic amplitude and phase modulation in the Gravitational Waves (GWs) signal. In contrast, strong gravitational lensing magnifies the incoming gravitational wave in an achromatic way, but can also lead to a constant phase shift. In reality, an observed GW signal can be lensed by both microlensing and strong lensing. To detect and characterize both microlensed and strong lensed GW events together, we have developed a novel method $\mu$-GLANCE (Micro-Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration). In this technique, we calculate the cross-correlation of the residual between different detectors with respect to the best fit and use a generalized template to search for both GW source and lensing parameters. We assign a false alarm rate to each candidate from a statistical viewpoint, depending on how many times the noise cross-correlation matches the strength of the residual cross-correlation of the candidate. We show that for an event with a matched-filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) close to thirty, a residual due to microlensing with an amplitude about $10\%$ of strong lensing magnification $\mu \approx 3.2$ will start to show deviation from noise distribution at more than $68\%$ C.I with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity for the fourth observation run. If the strong lensing or microlensing amplitude is higher (or lower), a lower (or higher) matched-filtering SNR will be required to identify any deviation. This method provides the first technique to detect both strong lensing and micro-lensing without assuming any specific lensing model, and its application on the current and future GW data can identify events with both chromatic and achromatic lensed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dispersion measure redshift relation with simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the dispersion measure (DM) of localised Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological and host galaxy parameters using simulation-based inference (SBI) for the first time. By simulating the large-scale structure of the electron density with the Generator for Large-Scale Structure (GLASS), we generate log-normal realisations of the free electron density field, accurately capturing the correlations between different FRBs. For the host galaxy contribution, we rigorously test various models, including log-normal, truncated Gaussian and Gamma distributions, while modelling the Milky Way component using pulsar data. Through these simulations, we employ the truncated sequential neural posterior estimation method to obtain the posterior. Using current observational data, we successfully recover the amplitude of the DM-redshift relation, consistent with Planck, while also fitting both the mean host contribution and its shape. Notably, we find no clear preference for a specific model of the host galaxy contribution. Although SBI may not yet be strictly necessary for FRB inference, this work lays the groundwork for the future, as the increasing volume of FRB data will demand precise modelling of both the host and large-scale structure components. Our modular simulation pipeline offers flexibility, allowing for easy integration of improved models as they become available, ensuring scalability and adaptability for upcoming analyses using FRBs. The pipeline is made publicly available under https://github.com/koustav-konar/FastNeuralBurst.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Two New Eruptions of the Ultrashort Recurrence Time Nova M31N 2017-01e</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the recent discovery of two new eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2017-01e in the Andromeda galaxy. The latest eruption, M31N 2024-08c, reached $R=17.8$ on 2024 August 06.85 UT, $\sim2$ months earlier than predicted. In addition to this recent eruption, a search of archival PTF data has revealed a previously unreported eruption on 2014 June 18.46 UT that reached a peak brightness of $R\sim17.9$ approximately a day later. The addition of these two eruption timings has allowed us to update the mean recurrence time of the nova. We find $\langle T_\mathrm{rec} \rangle = 924.0\pm7.0$ days ($2.53\pm0.02$ yr), which is slightly shorter than our previous determination. Thus, M31N 2017-01e remains the nova with the second shortest recurrence time known, with only M31N 2008-12a being shorter. We also present a low-resolution spectrum of the likely quiescent counterpart of the nova, a $\sim20.5$ mag evolved B star displaying an $\sim14.3$ d photometric modulation.</description>

      <title>Constraining Near-Simultaneous Radio Emission from Short Gamma-ray Bursts using CHIME/FRB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project to search for FRBs that are temporally and spatially coincident with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) occurring between 2018 July 7 and 2023 August 3. We do not find any temporal (within 1 week) and spatial (within overlapping 3 sigma localization regions) coincidences between any CHIME/FRB candidates and all GRBs with 1 sigma localization uncertainties &lt;1 deg. As such, we use CHIME/FRB to constrain the possible FRB-like radio emission for 27 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) that were within 17 deg. of CHIME/FRB's meridian at a point either 6 hrs prior up to 12 hrs after the high-energy emission. Two SGRBs, GRB 210909A and GRB 230208A, were above the horizon at CHIME at the time of their high-energy emission and we place some of the first constraints on simultaneous FRB-like radio emission from SGRBs. While neither of these two SGRBs have known redshifts, we construct a redshift range for each GRB based on their high-energy fluence and a derived SGRB energy distribution. For GRB 210909A, this redshift range corresponds to z = [0.009, 1.64] with a mean of z=0.13. Thus, for GRB 210909A, we constrain the radio luminosity at the time of the high-energy emission to L &lt;2 x 10e46 erg s-1, L &lt; 5 x 10e44 erg s-1, and L &lt; 3 x 10e42 erg s-1 assuming redshifts of z=0.85, z=0.16, and z=0.013, respectively. We compare these constraints with the predicted simultaneous radio luminosities from different compact object merger models.</description>

Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>

      <title>The AMS-02 cosmic ray deuteron flux is consistent with a secondary origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent measurements of cosmic ray deuteron fluxes by AMS-02 show that the rigidity dependence of deuterons is similar with that of protons but flatter than $^3$He, which has been attributed to the existence of primary deuterons with abundance much higher than that from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The requirement of highly deuteron-abundant sources imposes a serious challenge on the modern astrophysics since there is no known process to produce a large amount of deuterons without violating other constraints \citep{1976Natur.263..198E}. In this work we demonstrate that the fragmentation of heavy nuclei up to nickel plays a crucial role in shaping/enhancing the spectrum/flux of the cosmic ray deuterons. Based on the latest cosmic ray data, the predicted secondary fluxes of deuterons and $^3$He are found to be reasonably consistent with the AMS-02 measurements and a primary deuteron component is not needed. The observed differences between the spectra of D and $^3$He, as well as those between the D/$^4$He (D/p) and $^3$He/$^4$He ($^3$He/p) flux ratios, measured in the rigidity space, is probably due to the kinetic-energy-to-rigidity conversion and the solar modulation, given different charge-to-mass ratios of D and $^3$He. More precise measurements of the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei to produce deuterons, tritons, and $^3$He in a wide energy range will be very helpful in further testing the secondary origin of cosmic ray deuterons.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dissipation in short gamma-ray burst jets. I. Resistive relativistic MHD evolution in a model environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts originate when relativistic jets emerge from the remnants of binary neutron star mergers. Both the jet and the remnant are believed to be strongly magnetized, and the presence of magnetic fields is known to influence the jet propagation across the surrounding post-merger environment. In the magnetic interplay between the jet and the environment itself, effects due to a finite plasma conductivity may be important, especially in the first phases of the jet propagation. We aim to investigate such effects, from jet launching to its final breakout from the post-merger environment. 2D axisymmetric and full 3D resistive relativistic MHD simulations, are performed with the PLUTO numerical code. Different models for physical resistivity, which must be small but still above the numerical one (producing unwanted smearing of structures in any ideal MHD code) are considered and compared. All simulations are performed by using an axisymmetric analytical model for the jet propagation environment; we leave the case of jet propagation in a realistic environment (i.e. imported from actual binary neutron star merger simulation) to a later study. Significant differences in the jet structure and induced turbulence are clearly seen in 2D axisymmetric simulations. Regions with a resistive electric field parallel to the magnetic field form and non-thermal particle acceleration may be enhanced there. The level of dissipated Ohmic power is also dependent on the various recipes for resistivity. Most of the differences arise before breakout from the magnetized environment, whereas once the jet enters the external atmosphere these differences are preserved during further propagation despite the lower grid refinement. Finally, we show and discuss the 3D evolution of the jet within the same environment, in order to highlight the emergence of non-axisymmetric features.</description>

      <title>Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes Explains the X-Ray Weakness of the Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at $z&gt;4$ in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with $M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates ($1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4$) with zero spin, viewed at angles $&gt;30^\circ$ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed $2-10$ keV band reach $\sim10^4$ at $z=6$, $\sim5$ times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index $\Gamma=3.1$, mode of $\Gamma=4.4$). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot ($&gt;10^8$ K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within $10^\circ$ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a $\sim1.5\%$ probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at $z\sim6$ from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains $50\%$ of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of $\sim3$. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.</description>

      <title>Estimating False Alarm Rates of Sub-Dominant Quasi-normal Modes in GW190521</title>

Abstract: A major aim of gravitational wave astronomy is to test observationally the Kerr nature of black holes. The strongest such test, with minimal additional assumptions, is provided by observations of multiple ringdown modes, also known as black hole spectroscopy. For the gravitational wave merger event GW190521, we have previously claimed the detection of two ringdown modes emitted by the remnant black hole. In this paper we provide further evidence for the detection of multiple ringdown modes from this event. We analyse the recovery of simulated gravitational wave signals designed to replicate the ringdown properties of GW190521. We quantify how often our detection statistic reports strong evidence for a sub-dominant $(\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ ringdown mode, even when no such mode is present in the simulated signal. We find this only occurs with a probability $\sim 0.02$, which is consistent with a Bayes factor of $t_{\rm ref} + 6\,\mathrm{ms}$ (1$\sigma$ uncertainty) found for GW190521. We also quantify our agnostic analysis of GW190521, in which no relationship is assumed between ringdown modes, and find that only 1 in 250 simulated signals without a $(3,3,0)$ mode yields a result as significant as GW190521. Conversely, we verify that when simulated signals do have an observable $(3,3,0)$ mode they consistently yield a strong evidence and significant agnostic results. We also find that constraints on deviations from the $(3,3,0)$ mode on GW190521-like signals with a $(3,3,0)$ mode are consistent with what was obtained from our previous analysis of GW190521. Our results support our previous conclusion that the gravitational wave signal from GW190521 contains an observable sub-dominant $(\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ mode.</description>

      <title>Octupolar test of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries with unequal masses and whose orbits are not aligned with the observer's line of sight are excellent probes of gravitational radiation beyond the quadrupole approximation. Among the compact binaries observed so far, strong evidence of octupolar modes is seen in GW190412 and GW190814, two binary black holes observed during the first half of the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo observatories. These two events, therefore, provide a unique opportunity to test the consistency of the octupolar modes with the predictions of general relativity (GR). In the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to GR, the gravitational-wave phasing has known dependencies on different radiative multipole moments, including the mass octupole. This permits the use of publicly released posteriors of the PN phase deformation parameters for placing constraints on the deformations to the different PN components of the radiative mass octupole denoted by $\delta \mu_{3n}$. Combining the posteriors on $\delta \mu_{3n}$ from these two events, we deduce a joint bound (at 90% credibility) on the first three PN order terms in the radiative octupoles to be $\delta \mu_{30}=-0.07^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $\delta \mu_{32}=0.48^{+0.93}_{-1.15}$, and $\delta \mu_{33}=-0.32^{+1.67}_{-0.62}$, consistent with GR predictions. Among these, the measurement of $\delta \mu_{33}$ for the first time confirms the well-known octupolar tail contribution, a novel nonlinear effect due to the scattering of the octupolar radiation by the background spacetime, is consistent with the predictions of GR. Detection of similar systems in the future observing runs should further tighten these constraints.</description>

      <title>Low evidence for ringdown overtone in GW150914 when marginalizing over time and sky location uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tests of the no-hair theorem using astrophysical black holes involve the detection of at least two quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the gravitational wave emitted by a perturbed black hole. A detection of two modes -- the dominant, $(\ell, m, n) = (2,2,0)$, mode and its first overtone, the $(2,2,1)$ mode -- in the post-merger signal of the binary black hole merger GW150914 was claimed in Isi et al. [arXiv:1905.00869], with further evidence provided in Isi &amp; Farr [arXiv:2202.02941]. However, Cotesta et al. [arXiv:2201.00822] disputed this claim, finding that evidence for the overtone only appeared if the signal was analyzed before merger, when a QNM description of the signal is not valid. Due to technical challenges, both of these analyses fixed the merger time and sky location of GW150914 when estimating the evidence for the overtone. At least some of the contention can be attributed to fixing these parameters. Here, we surmount this difficulty and fully marginalize over merger time and sky-location uncertainty while doing a post-merger QNM analysis of GW150914. We find that marginalizing over all parameters yields low evidence for the presence of the overtone, with a Bayes factor of $1.10\pm 0.03$ in favor of a QNM model with the overtone versus one without. The arrival time uncertainty of GW150914 is too large to definitively claim detection of the $(2,2,1)$ mode.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernovae from First-generation Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift $z\lesssim2.5$ are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z $\gtrsim 6$.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect $\sim 1(2)$ SNe Ia from Pop III stars at $z\approx 4(5)$ for a survey of area $300 \;\rm arcmin^2$ during a $3\;\rm yr$ period with JWST. The same survey may record more than $\sim 400$ SNe Ia at lower redshift ($z\lesssim 2.5$) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be $\sim 6$ Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of $5-10$.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of $5-10$ can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid models (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>
