      <title>Towards a classification of graded unitary ${\mathcal W}_3$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study constraints imposed by four-dimensional unitarity (formalised as graded unitarity in recent work by the first author) on possible ${\mathcal W}_3$ vertex algebras arising from four-dimensions via the SCFT/VOA correspondence. Under the assumption that the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration is a weight-based filtration with respect to the usual strong generators of the vertex algebra, we demonstrate that all values of the central charge other than those of the $(3,q+4)$ minimal models are incompatible with four-dimensional unitarity. These algebras are precisely the ones that are realised by performing principal Drinfel'd--Sokolov reduction to boundary-admissible $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ affine current algebras; those affine algebras were singled out by a similar graded unitarity analysis in \cite{ArabiArdehali:2025fad}. Furthermore, these particular vertex algebras are known to be associated with the $(A_2,A_q)$ Argyres--Douglas theories.</description>

      <title>Gaussian continuous tensor network states: short-distance properties and imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Gaussian continuous tensor network states (GCTNS) - a finitely-parameterized subclass of Gaussian states admitting an interpretation as continuum limits of discrete tensor network states. We show that, at short distance, GCTNS correspond to free Lifshitz vacua, establishing a connection between certain entanglement properties of the two. Two schemes to approximate ground states of (free) bosonic field theories using GCTNS are presented: rational approximants to the exact dispersion relation and Trotterized imaginary-time evolution. We apply them to Klein-Gordon theory and characterize the resulting approximations, identifying the energy scales at which deviations from the target theory appear. These results provide a simple and analytically controlled setting to assess the strengths and limitations of GCTNS as variational ans\"atze for relativistic quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Group character averages via a single Laguerre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Average of exponential ${\rm Tr}_R e^X$, i.e. of a group rather than an algebra character, in Gaussian matrix model is known to be an amusing generalization of Schur polynomial, where time variables are substituted by traces of products of non-commuting matrices ${\rm Tr} \left(\prod_i A_{k_i}\right)$ and are thus labeled by weak compositions. The entries of matrices $A_k$ are made from extended Laguerre polynomials, what introduces additional difficulties. We describe the generic sum rules, which express arbitrary traces through convolutions of a single Laguerre polynomial $L_{N-1}^1(z_{k_i})$, what is a considerable simplification.</description>

      <title>Multi-centered Myers-Perry Black Holes in Five Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new family of multi-centered rotating black hole solutions in 5D vacuum Einstein gravity, providing explicit examples of cohomogeneity-three spacetimes. It is well known that, in the presence of two commuting Killing vector fields, the theory reduces to 3D gravity coupled to an $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$ nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields. We show that the scalar fields of the extremal Myers-Perry solution can be expressed in terms of two harmonic functions on 3D flat space, and that promoting these functions to include multiple sources yields explicit multi-centered extremal Myers-Perry black holes located at arbitrary positions. Each center forms a smooth $S^3$ Killing horizon, provided that the rotation parameters satisfy $|j_i|&lt;1/2$. We further demonstrate that all curvature singularities are hidden behind the horizons and that no closed timelike curves arise on or outside the horizons. The solutions are asymptotically locally Minkowski in the sense that constant-time hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE). As a concrete example, we consider a binary configuration, examine its rod structure, and demonstrate the absence of conical singularities between the two black holes, indicating that they are supported by an intermediate bubble region separating them.</description>

      <title>Error correcting codes and heterotic Narain CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study error correcting codes that construct the Narain lattices of heterotic strings as code lattices. We identify, in both $E_8\times E_8$ and Spin$(32)/Z_2$ heterotic strings, a pair of a binary code and a set of the corresponding metric, B field, and background gauge field, such that the lattice constructed from the binary code by Construction A coincides with the Narain lattice. We also construct heterotic Narain lattices using codes over $F_3$ and $F_5$ by Construction A${}_C$ and "Construction A${}_g$" with $g=SU(5)$, respectively. As a bi-product, we also clarify the relationship between codes that construct Euclidean even self-dual lattices and NSR-fermions, where the $Z_2$ inversion structure of the generator matrices plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>Where Multipartite Entanglement Localizes: The Junction Law for Genuine Multi-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a "junction law" for genuine multipartite entanglement, suggesting that in gapped local systems multipartite entanglement is controlled and effectively localized near junctions where subsystem boundaries meet. Using the R\'enyi-2 genuine multi-entropy $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ as a diagnostic of genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement, we establish this behavior in $(2+1)$-dimensional gapped free-fermion lattices with correlation length $\xi$. For partitions with a single junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ exhibits a universal scaling crossover in $L/\xi$, growing for $L\ll\xi$ and saturating to a $\xi$-dependent constant for $L\gg\xi$, up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-L/\xi})$ corrections. In sharp contrast, for partitions without a junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ is exponentially suppressed in $L/\xi$ and drops below numerical resolution once $L\gg\xi$. We observe the same pattern for $\mathtt{q}=3$ (tripartite) and $\mathtt{q}=4$ (quadripartite) cases, and further corroborate this localization by translating the junction at fixed system size. We also provide a geometric explanation of the junction law in holography. Altogether, these results show that in this gapped free-fermion setting genuine multipartite entanglement is localized within a correlation-length neighborhood of junctions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom of V-A Fermi Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the V-A Fermi interaction and apply an earlier developed method for summing up the leading asymptotics for scattering amplitudes in non-renormalizable theories. We consider the amplitude of fermion-antifermion scattering and derive the corresponding RG equation that sums the leading logarithmic contributions just like in renormalizable models. Numerical solution of this equation in the asymptotic regime $s\sim t\sim u \sim E^2 \to \infty$ leads to amplitude logarithmically decreasing with energy, thus restoring the unitarity violated at the tree level.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of fermion mass in a scalar-fermion theory with ${\lambda}{\phi}^4$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective potential for a scalar theory with $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction, coupled to a massless fermion through Yukawa interaction is calculated by summing over infinite number of two particle irreducible (2PI) diagrams of two different types and a 2PI diagram of a third type using Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis (CJT) method. There is an inversion symmetry present in the effective potential under $\phi\rightarrow -\phi$. At large coupling it exhibits minima below the zero potential line and on either side of the maximum at $\phi=0$. The fermion acquires a mass at any non-trivial, positive minimum breaking the inversion symmetry of the vacuum.</description>

      <title>M2-branes, Higher Form Symmetries and 1-Gerbes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-Form Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane formulated on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are investigated. We show that there is an obstruction to the gauging of these global symmetries in the presence of background fields, a mixed 't~Hooft anomaly. Its cancellation is obtained by the inflow term constructed in terms of gauge fields which are flat connections on a $U(1)$-principal bundle and a torsion $\mathcal{G}_1^{\nabla_c}$-gerbe on the M2-brane worldvolume. The effect of these gauge structures together with non trivial \textit{winding} embedding maps ensures the breaking of the continuous HFS $U(1)$ symmetry to a discrete subgroup and a worldvolume flux condition on the M2-brane. A Wilson surface, identified with the holonomy Hol$_\nabla$ one of the Gerbe structures, the flat $\mathcal{G}_1^{\nabla_c}$-gerbe, is naturally introduced as the topological operator characterizing the M2-brane. The resulting topological operators realize discrete symmetries associated with the \textit{winding} and the flux/\textit{monopole} sectors, and their operator algebra is well-defined: the \textit{monopole} operator acts non trivially on a \textit{vortex-dressed} operator, while the winding operator acts on the pullback of the Wilson surface.</description>

      <title>Dynamic effects of external axion fields in a system of many particles with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theoretical model that describes dynamic non-equilibrium effects of external inertial and axion fields in a system of particles with spin. The possibility of using the spin density and the current density of non-relativistic quantum particle systems for the detection of the hypothetical axion-like dark matter is discussed. The resulting closed system of dynamic equations encompasses the continuity equation, the momentum balance equation, and the spin density evolution equation, accounting for the influence of the spin-rotation coupling and the external axion fields. The new formalism opens up new perspectives for an experimental search of dark matter axions.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills Flux Tube in AdS II: Effective String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of flux tubes in confining gauge theories placed in a rigid AdS background, focusing on the three-dimensional case. Our analysis is performed in the large-radius regime, where effective string theory provides a good approximation of the dynamics. Using a combination of techniques, primarily the analytic transcendentality ansatz bootstrap, we compute observables up to two-loop order in the expansion in powers of the string length over the AdS radius, which constitutes the main result of this work. Finally, we employ Pad\'e resummations to explore the possible compatibility of our results with a smooth interpolation of observables between large-radius AdS and small-radius AdS, in which gauge theory is weakly coupled.</description>

      <title>The most general four-derivative Unitary String Effective Action with Torsion and Stringy-Running-Vacuum-Model Inflation: Old ideas from a modern perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string-inspired running vacuum model (StRVM) of inflation is based on a Chern-Simons (CS) gravity effective action, in which the only four-spacetime-derivative-order term is a gravitational anomalous CS Pontryagin density coupled to an axion. In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many attempts to introduce fundamental nonlocality into quantum (or classical) field theory are based on the assumption that exponentials of the d'Alembertian are positive-definite, so that these operators can be employed without engendering the Ostrogradskian instability associated with higher derivative Lagrangians. {\bf This assumption is false.} Working in the simple context of a 1-dimensional, point particle $q(t)$, I demonstrate that the equation $\exp[T^2 \tfrac{d^2}{dt^2}] q(t) = 0$ has an infinite number of rapidly oscillating, exponentially rising and falling solutions. This infinite kernel is in one-to-one correspondence with the ability to specify ``initial value data'' {\it arbitrarily} over {\it any} finite interval $t_1 &lt; t &lt; t_2$.</description>

      <title>Rotating Black Holes with Primary Scalar Hair: Shadow Signatures in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image of M87* provides a direct test of strong-field gravity, measuring an angular shadow diameter $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3~\mu\mathrm{as}$ and a circularity deviation $\Delta C \leq 0.1$. Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $\theta_d$ and $\Delta C$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q&gt;0$. Finally, the scalar-hair-induced deviations are of order $\mathcal{O}(\mu\mathrm{as})$, placing them near the sensitivity threshold of present instruments and within reach of next-generation horizon-scale imaging.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Holes formed by Null Energy Condition Violation during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transient violation of the null energy condition (NEC) during inflation provides a novel mechanism for producing primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds. In this work, we extend previous studies by computing the GW contributions from both the ringdown phase of PBH formation and subsequent binary mergers. Our results show that this scenario produces a rich, multi-component GW spectrum consisting of primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs, and GW emissions from PBH ringdown and binary mergers. We demonstrate that these correlated signatures across different frequency bands provide a novel and powerful avenue to probe or constrain NEC violation during inflation through future multi-band GW observations.</description>

Abstract: Deviations from the area law of the horizon entropy, in the cosmological setup, are known to lead to modified Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the universe. In this work, we propose that such modifications need not be introduced phenomenologically but can emerge dynamically from stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe perturbed by a conformal, time-dependent noise factor, whose ensemble average vanishes, leaving the mean background geometry unchanged. By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including R\'enyi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies. Our results suggest that deviations from the area law can be interpreted as the macroscopic, coarse-grained imprint of unresolved, microscopic stochastic degrees of freedom in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Positive Charts of Toric Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct affine charts of a smooth projective toric variety which contain its nonnegative points, and which admit a closed embedding into the total coordinate space of Cox's quotient construction. We show that such positive charts arise from smooth subcones of the nef cone. To each positive chart we associate an algebraic moment map, the fibers of which are the critical points of a monomial function in Cox coordinates. This work provides a toric framework for the theory of $u$-equations in positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity in decohered topological states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.</description>

Abstract: We consider the phenomenon of string breaking in the context of the spatial Wilson loops using the gauge/string duality. In particular, we discuss the impact of light flavors on the pseudopotential. We also introduce the notion of the spatial string breaking distance and estimate it for $SU(3)$ gauge theory in the temperature range $0\,\text{-}\,3\,T_c$.</description>

Abstract:   We considered the Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) of charged particles onto photons whose distribution is a Black Body Radiation (BBR) deriving the exact energy and angular differential distribution in the general case and in its most useful expansions. These results can be successfully applied in high energy accelerators experiments to evaluate the ICS contribution from the thermal photons in the cavity as well as in astrophysics where the ICS of cosmic rays plays a relevant role in a variety of phenomena. In particular we show how our formulae reproduce the ICS energy spectrum recently measured at LEP, how it could be considered a key tool in explaining the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) , SGRs energy spectrum. Finally we predicted the presence of a low gamma flux, nearly detectable at hundred of TeV from SNRs SN1006 as well as, at lower energy (tens TeV, due to gamma ray cascading in cosmic BBR), from relic extragalactic highest cosmic rays sources born by jets in AGN,as blazars 3C279,Mrk421,Mrk 501.</description>

      <title>The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Trivialization of the gravitational Green-Schwarz transformation in the non-relativistic limit of string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the gravitational Green-Schwarz (GS) transformation becomes trivial in the non-relativistic (NR) limit of ten-dimensional heterotic supergravity with four-derivative corrections. This constitutes an important step towards establishing the trivialization of the GS mechanism in this limit. In this work, we perform a NR expansion of the Kalb-Ramond field and identify the finite Green-Schwarz transformation in this limit, which can be interpreted as a non-covariant $SO(8)$ transformation. We then construct an explicit field redefinition such that the redefined two-form is invariant under this symmetry. This result is compared with the previously reported trivialization of the gauge GS mechanism under the same limit. Both field redefinitions can be implemented simultaneously, and the associated Chern-Simons terms are exact, arising directly from the redefinition structure, and leading to a trivial Bianchi identity. These results support the expectation that anomaly cancellation becomes automatic in the NR regime, and therefore we discuss their potential implications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine recent advancements of the spinor helicity formalism of massive particles. Technical aspects about the formulation of massive helicity spinors are presented in detail to analyze the projective-geometry kinematics of helicity spinors as well as the diagrammatical and analytical structure of their interactions. Two new methods for calculating massive cross sections are derived and tested on Bhabha and Compton processes: a quasi-high-energy limit and an assembly of partial cross sections. The acquisition of mass, where ultrarelativistic amplitudes coalesce at low energy, is given a physical interpretation as the localization of particle worldlines in twistor theory. By subsuming the spinor helicity formalism in this way, both spacetime and particle content can emerge from null, lightlike, and timelike twistors.</description>

Abstract: From the classical $SO({\cal N}=8)$ extended superconformal algebra between the lowest ${\cal N}=8$ multiplet in two dimensions obtained by Ademollo et al. (1976), we generalize it for the arbitrary ${\cal N}=8$ multiplet with manifest $SU(8)$ symmetry containing the bosonic $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra. By modifying this ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra in two dimensions, we propose a consistent celestial soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitinos, the graviphotons, the graviphotinos, and the scalars in the ${\cal N}=8$ supergravity theory with $SO(8)$ (or $SU(8)$) global symmetry in four dimensions initiated by de Wit and Freedman (at Stony Brook in 1977). The twenty five couplings in this celestial algebra can be written in terms of eight arbitrary couplings via the Jacobi identity.</description>

      <title>Impact of space-time curvature coupling on the vacuum energy induced by a magnetic topological defect in flat space-time of arbitrary dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a general Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</description>

Abstract: We provide an explicit realization of the Corner Proposal for Quantum Gravity in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions, or equivalently, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We construct coherent states of the Quantum Corner Symmetry group and compute the entanglement entropy relative to these states. We derive the classical corner charges and relate them to operator expectation values in coherent states. For a subset of coherent states that we call classical states, we find that the entanglement entropy exhibits a leading term proportional to the area, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity and gauge theory are concretely linked by the double copy. Although well-studied at the level of perturbative scattering in vacuum, far less is known about non-perturbative aspects or extensions of the double copy beyond trivial backgrounds. We show here how Hawking radiation in a collapse metric, its associated thermal spectrum, and horizon-dependence, emerges from the double copy of particle production in a background gauge field, where there is no global horizon, nor a thermal spectrum. Our approach combines worldline and amplitudes methods, and allows the unification of several classical and quantum double copy prescriptions for black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of the E-string theory and its compactifications as well as their applications to four-dimensional topology. In particular, we compute the partition function of the topologically twisted theory on $M_4\times T^2$, where $M_4$ is a four-manifold. In a range of examples, we verify that this partition function, as a $q$-series, 1) has integral coefficients, 2) is modular, and 3) can be lifted to a topological modular form. Remarkably, the E-string theory "knows" about various subtle aspects of the world of smooth 4-manifolds, as the (topological) modularity of the partition function is contingent on a collection of properties of 4-manifolds and their Seiberg-Witten invariants, including, notably, the simple-type conjecture. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical evidences indicate that this partition function defines a genuine smooth invariant, even when $b_2^+\le 1$. Therefore, the E-string theory may offer powerful new tools for exploring regions in the geography of 4-manifolds that have been inaccessible to existing invariants obtained from gauge theory and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Subleading soft radiation during scattering of dressed states in QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study soft photon emission during scattering of Faddeev-Kulish charged states in QED, at leading order in perturbation theory. The charged asymptotic particles are accompanied by clouds of an infinite number of soft photons of energy less than a characteristic infrared scale $E_d$. When the corresponding ``dressing'' functions are suitably corrected to subleading order in the soft momentum expansion, as advocated in recent work by Choi and Akhoury, we show explicitly that the emission of additional radiative soft photons with energy less than $E_d$ is completely suppressed. Moreover, the dressing renders the elastic amplitudes infrared-finite, order by order in perturbation theory, regulating the infrared divergences due to virtual soft photons, at the energy scale $E_d$. Therefore, the characteristic energy scale of the soft photons in the clouds provides an effective infrared cutoff, allowing for the formulation of an infrared finite S-matrix.</description>

      <title>A Rosetta Stone for Wilson Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the construction of a map between weak (gauge) and strong (string) coupling degrees of freedom for the supersymmetric Wilson line-defect in the planar N=4 Super-Yang-Mills. By analysing the Partition Functions at zero and infinite coupling, we propose a map from degrees of freedom capturing single- and singlet two-particle states at zero coupling to infinite coupling. This map predicts that the dimension of states in these particular sectors doubles as it goes from zero to infinite coupling. We test this prediction against the non-perturbative spectrum of insertions on the Wilson line obtained using integrability. In addition to already available integrability-based results, we obtain the non-perturbative scaling dimensions of the simplest non-trivial operators with transverse spin about the Wilson line, thereby extending the Quantum Spectral Curve construction to such charged sectors.</description>

      <title>Reduced superblocks at next-to-next-to-extremality for all maximally supersymmetric CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider mixed four-point correlators of 1/2-BPS operators $\mathcal{O}_{k}$ in the maximally supersymmetric CFTs, i.e. the 3d $\mathcal{N}=8$, 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$, and 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories. In arXiv:hep-th/0405180, Dolan, Gallot, and Sokatchev demonstrated that four-point correlators of identical $\mathcal{O}_{k}$ in these SCFTs can be expressed in terms of a number of unconstrained one- and two-variable ``reduced correlator" functions acted on by a $2(\varepsilon-1)$nd order differential operator $\Delta_\varepsilon$, which is non-local in odd dimensions $d=2(\varepsilon+1)$. We generalize this construction to mixed correlators $\langle \mathcal{O}_{k_1}\mathcal{O}_{k_2}\mathcal{O}_{k_3}\mathcal{O}_{k_1+k_2+k_3-2\mathcal{E}}\rangle$ up to extremality $\mathcal{E}=2$. To construct superconformal blocks, we generalize the R-symmetry channel equations and use Jack polynomial expansions to recursively generate the full spectrum of conformal blocks in a superblock from a single channel. We observe that for each $\varepsilon$, this channel equation can be inverted to expand the reduced correlators in ``reduced superblocks" involving blocks with shifted external kinematics. These reduced blocks reproduce what is known in 4d, generalize the known $\langle \mathcal{O}_{2}\mathcal{O}_{2}\mathcal{O}_{k}\mathcal{O}_{k}\rangle$ case in 6d, and offer a novel result in 3d.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Skein Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits in its Lie algebra. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</description>

      <title>Averages of Exponentials from the point of view of Superintegrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate Gaussian averages of arbitrary exponentials of the matrix variable $X$ with the help of superintegrability, which provides explicit expressions for Schur averages. As in the simpler cases the answer is expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials, but in a somewhat sophisticated way. It involves triangular sum over partitions, with simple exponential factor and a complicated polynomial prefactor. Some ingredients of the formula are not found in full generality and there is still a room for further work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Or should we talk about dS/CFT correspondence or dS/SFT correspondence in cosmological correlators? In non-unitary field theories -- which are conjectured to be dual to cosmological correlators -- scale invariance does not necessarily imply full conformal invariance. While general relativity predicts the emergence of conformal invariance (or boost symmetry in the bulk), various modified theories of gravity suggest only scale invariance, characterized by the absence of bulk boost symmetry. We demonstrate this distinction using Einstein-Aether theory as a canonical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perverse schobers are categorifications of perverse sheaves. In prior work we constructed a perverse schober on a partial compactification of the stringy K\"ahler moduli space (SKMS) associated by Halpern-Leistner and Sam to a quasi-symmetric representation of a reductive group. When the group is a torus the SKMS corresponds to the complement of the GKZ discriminant locus (which is a hyperplane arrangement in the quasi-symmetric case shown by Kite). We show here that a suitable variation of the perverse schober we constructed provides a categorification of the associated GKZ hypergeometric system in the case of non-resonant parameters. As an intermediate result we give a description of the monodromy of such "quasi-symmetric" GKZ hypergeometric systems.</description>

      <title>1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry and Majorana strong zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302 and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared in arXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in six distinct cases, one involving a violation of the consistency conditions, that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the trace-free Einstein tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian metric cannot arise by variation of a local diffeomorphism-invariant action functional with the (inverse) metric as field variable. We show that this statement remains true even for general local actions, without the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both approaches and highlight their merits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Dynamics of Radiating Charges: Canonical Formulation and Binary Inspiral Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit electromagnetic analogue of the post-Newtonian Hamiltonian framework widely used in gravitational-wave physics. Starting from the Lorentz-Dirac equation and implementing Landau-Lifshitz order reduction, we derive the near-zone 1.5 PN dipole radiation-reaction force and combine it with the Darwin Hamiltonian through 1PN order to obtain a closed canonical N-body phase-space system. The equations are directly implementable, strictly conservative when dissipation is switched off, and exhibit monotonic energy loss, secular inspiral, and circularization when radiation reaction is included. For binaries we derive analytic circular and eccentric inspiral laws, including 1PN conservative corrections to the dipole-driven inspiral and merger time. Extending to charged compact binaries in Einstein-Maxwell theory, we combine the 2PN ADM-type conservative Hamiltonian with leading 1.5PN dipole dissipation and gravitational quadrupole flux, obtaining gauge-invariant energy--frequency relations, closed-form circular inspiral laws, and a dipole-quadrupole crossover scale that separates electromagnetic and gravitational flux dominated inspirals.</description>

      <title>Green's function on the Tate curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus. In particular, it turns out that this Green's function recovers the N\'eron local height function for the Tate curve in the $p\to\infty$ limit, when the $j$-invariant has odd valuation. So this non-Archimedean height function now acquires a physics meaning in terms of the large $p$ limit of a non-Archimedean conformal field theory two point function on the Tate curve, as well as a direct analytic interpretation as a Green's function, on the same footing as in the Archimedean place.</description>

      <title>A Modified Center-of-Mass Conservation Law in Finite-Domain Simulations of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate conservation laws of the two-dimensional Zakharov--Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, a natural higher-dimensional and non-integrable extension of the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Clifford algebras, meson algebras and higher order generalisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the homogeneous parts of Clifford and meson algebras and point out that for the Clifford algebra it is related to fermionic statistics, that is, to fermionic parastatistics of order 1 while for the meson algebra it is related to fermionic parastatistics of order 2. We extend these homogeneous algebras into corresponding algebras related to fermionic parastatistics of all orders. We then define correspondingly higher order generalizations of Clifford and meson algebras.</description>

      <title>Dirac mode localization in QCD near the crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Producing $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in $\pi^-p$ reaction to explore their inner structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the production mechanisms of the hyperon resonances $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in the $\pi^- p$ scattering are investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach incorporating Regge trajectories. By including contributions from $t$-channel $K^*$ and $u$-channel $\Sigma$ exchanges, we perform global fits to the total and differential cross sections for $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1405)$ and $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1520)$. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $\Lambda(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $\Lambda(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $\Lambda(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $\Lambda(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $\Lambda^* \to \pi \Sigma$, the Dalitz process $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K \Lambda^{*} \rightarrow K \pi \Sigma$ is also calculated. Our results demonstrate that reconstructing $\Lambda^*$ via the $K\pi\Sigma$ final state is experimentally feasible. This study provides important theoretical insights into the production dynamics of these hyperon resonances, and suggests future high-precision measurements of the $t$-distribution at large momentum transfer at facilities such as AMBER, J-PARC, HIKE, and HIAF, which can further clarify their reaction mechanisms and structural properties.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of chiral symmetry breaking and the conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the vacuum as a function of quark flavor number $N_f$ within the chiral limit. By self-consistently solving the coupled DSEs for the quark and gluon propagators in a minimal QCD scheme, we elucidate the nonperturbative dynamics governing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Our calculations determine a critical flavor number of $N_f^c=6.81$ which marks the chiral symmetry restoration of quarks. Further analysis reveals the critical exponents of the chiral condensate as $ -\langle\bar{\psi} {\psi}\rangle\sim |N_f-N_f^c|^{0.53(9)}$, characterized the second order feature of this phase transition of chiral symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications for the walking regime towards the conformal window at larger flavor.</description>

      <title>Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\"{o}dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</description>
