      <title>An improvement on a result of Davies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1971, Davies proved that finitely many parallel line segments can be simultaneously fully rotated in an arbitrarily small area. In this paper we show that an even stronger statement holds: The unit square can be fully rotated in such a way that each initially vertical line segment sweeps a set of small area.
  A set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to have the strong Kakeya property if for any two of its positions, the set can be continuously moved between these two positions in an arbitrarily small area. We use the above result to show that a wide family of sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$, for instance the curved surface of a cylinder, have the strong Kakeya property.</description>

      <title>The isominwidth problem on the 2-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P\'al's isominwidth theorem states that for a fixed minimal width, the regular triangle has minimal area. A spherical version of this theorem was proven by Bezdek and Blekherman, if the minimal width is at most $\tfrac \pi 2$. If the width is greater than $\tfrac \pi 2$, the regular triangle no longer minimizes the area at fixed minimal width. We show that the minimizers are instead given by the polar sets of spherical Reuleaux triangles. Moreover, stability versions of the two spherical inequalities are obtained.</description>

      <title>Projection onto the core: An optimal reallocation to correct market failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides formulae and algorithms to compute the projection onto the core of a preimputation outside it. The core of a game is described using an exponential number of linear constraints, and we cannot know beforehand which are redundant or defining the polytope. We apply these new results to market games, a class of games in which every game has a nonempty core. Given an initial state of the game represented by a preimputation, it is not guaranteed that the state of the game evolves toward the core following the dynamics induced by the domination relations. Our results identify and compute the most efficient side payment that acts on a given state of the game and yields its closest core allocation. Using this side payment, we propose a way to evaluate the failure of a market to reach a state of the economy belonging to the core, and we propose a new solution concept consisting of preimputations that minimizes this failure.</description>

      <title>The prime grid contains arbitrarily large empty polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves a 2017 conjecture of De Loera, La Haye, Oliveros, and Rold\'an-Pensado that the "prime grid" $\big\{(p,q) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 : \text{$p$ and $q$ are prime}\big\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ contains empty polygons with arbitrarily many vertices. This implies that no Helly-type theorem is true for the prime grid.</description>

      <title>Real Gaussian exponential sums via a real moment map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expected number of solutions of a system of identically distributed exponential sums with centered Gaussian coefficient and arbitrary variance. We use the Adler and Taylor theory of Gaussian random fields to identify a moment map which allows to express the expected number of solution as an integral over the Newton polytope, in analogy with the Bernstein Khovanskii Kushnirenko Theorem. We apply this result to study the monotonicity of the expected number of solution with respect to the support of the exponential sum in an open set. We find that, when a point is added in the support in the interior of the Newton polytope there exists an open sets where the expected number of solutions decreases, answering negatively to a local version of a conjecture by B\"urgisser. When the point added in the support is far enough away from the Newton polytope we show that, in dimension 1, the number of solutions increases everywhere, while in dimension &gt;1 there is an unbounded open set where the number of solution decreases. We also prove some new lower bounds for the Aronszajn multiplication of exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Metric limits of manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any Riemannian metric conformal to the round metric on $S^n$, for $n\geq 4$, arises as a limit of a sequence of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on $S^n$ in the sense of uniform convergence of Riemannian distance. In particular, non-negativity of scalar curvature is not preserved under such limits.</description>

      <title>Visible quasihyperbolic geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by the work of Bonk, Heinonen, and Koskela (Asterisque, 2001), we consider the problem of the equivalence of the Gromov boundary and Euclidean boundary. Our strategy to study this problem comes from the recent work of Bharali and Zimmer (Adv. Math., 2017) and Bracci, Nikolov, and Thomas (Math. Z., 2021). We present the concept of a quaihyperbolic visibility domain (QH-visibility domain) for domains that meet the visibility property in relation to the quasihyperbolic metric. By utilizing this visibility property, we offer a comprehensive solution to this problem. Indeed, we prove that such domains are precisely the QH-visibility domains that have no geodesic loops in the Euclidean closure. Furthermore, we establish a general criterion for a domain to be the QH-visibility domain. Using this criterion, one can determine that uniform domains, John domains, and domains that satisfy quasihyperbolic boundary conditions are QH-visibility domains. We also compare the visibility of hyperbolic and quasihyperbolic metrics for planar hyperbolic domains. As an application of the visibility property, we study the homeomorphic extension of quasiconformal maps. Moreover, we also study the QH-visibility of unbounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, we present a few examples of QH-visibility domains that are not John domains or QHBC domains.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any $\ell_p$-norm in the plane with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and for every infinite $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, there exists a two-colouring of the plane such that no isometric copy of $\mathcal{M}$ is monochromatic. On the contrary, we show that for every polygonal norm (that is, the unit ball is a polygon) in the plane, there exists an infinite $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that for every two-colouring of the plane there exists a monochromatic isometric copy of $\mathcal{M}$.</description>

      <title>Chromatic number of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that an old theorem of Graham implies that for any positive integer $s$, there exists some positive integer $T(s)$ such that every $s$-colouring of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y),(x',y')$ with $(x-x')^2 - (y-y')^2 = (T(s))^2$. By scaling, this implies that every finite colouring of $\mathbb{Q}^2$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y),(x',y')$ with $(x-x')^2 - (y-y')^2 = 1$, which answers in a strong sense a problem of Kosheleva and Kreinovich on a pseudo-Euclidean analogue of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem.
  The proof of Graham's theorem relies on repeated applications of van der Waerden's theorem, and so the resulting function $T(s)$ grows extremely quickly. We give an alternative proof in the weaker setting of having a second spacial dimension that results in a significantly improved bound. To be more precise, we prove that for every positive integer $s$ with $r\equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, every $s$-colouring of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y,z),(x',y',z')$ such that $(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 - (z-z')^2 = (5^{(s-2)/4}(8\cdot 5^{(s-2)/2})!)^2$. In fact, we prove a stronger density version. The density version in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ remains open.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit lower bound, in terms of the distance from the boundary, for the Kobayashi metric of a certain class of bounded pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth boundary using the regularity theory for the complex Monge--Ampere equation. Using such an estimate, we construct a family of unbounded Kobayashi hyperbolic domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ having a certain negative-curvature-type property with respect to the Kobayashi distance. As an application, we prove a Picard-type extension theorem for the latter domains.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Maximum Degree in Ordered Nearest Neighbor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an ordered point set in a Euclidean space or, more generally, in an abstract metric space, the ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph is obtained by connecting each of the points to its closest predecessor by a directed edge. We show that for every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree at least $\log{n}/(4d)$. Apart from the $1/(4d)$ factor, this bound is the best possible. As for the abstract setting, we show that for every $n$-element metric space, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}/\log\log{n}})$.</description>
