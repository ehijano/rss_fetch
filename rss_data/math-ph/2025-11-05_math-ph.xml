      <title>Analysis of dissipative dynamics on noncommutative spaces and statistical inference of continuous time network stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we analyse the generalisations of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) semigroup and study them in both quantum and classical setups. In the first three chapters, we analyse the dissipative dynamics on noncommutative/quantum spaces, in particular, the systems with multiparticle interactions associated to CCR algebras. We provide various models where the dissipative dynamics are constructed using noncommutative Dirichlet forms. Some of our models decay to equilibrium algebraically and the Poincare inequality does not hold. Using the classical representation of generators of nilpotent Lie algebras, we provide the noncommutative representations of Lie algebras in terms of creation and annihilation operators and discuss the construction of corresponding Dirichlet forms. This introduces the opportunity to explore quantum stochastic processes related to Lie algebras and nilpotent Lie algebras. Additionally, these representations enable the investigation of the noncommutative analogue of hypoellipticity. In another direction, we explore the potential for introducing statistical models within a quantum framework. In this thesis, however, we present a classical statistical model of multivariate Graph superposition of OU (Gr supOU) process which allows for long(er) memory in the modelling of sparse graphs. We estimate these processes using generalised method of moments and show that it yields consistent estimators. We demonstrate the asymptotic normality of the moment estimators and validate these estimators through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>A regularized Matched Interface and Boundary Method (MIB) for Solving Polarizable Multipole Poisson-Boltzmann model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately model the electron density and polarization, a polarizable multipole (PM) model using the AMOEBA force field has been introduced \cite{Ren:2003, Shi:2013} recently. In the AMOEBA force field, the traditional point atomic representation is updated with permanent multipoles including additional dipoles and quadrupoles at atom centers in terms of derivatives of delta functions. Meanwhile, the polarization of the solute is considered by the introduction of induced dipoles. The AMOEBA forcefield thus shows significantly better agreement with experimental and high-level {\it ab initio} results. Moreover, the AMOEBA force field keeps the simple atomic structure, so that it can conviniently replace the traditional partial charge model.
  In this paper, we address the numerical challenges associated with the Polarizable Multipole Poisson--Boltzamnnn (PM-PB) model, which couples the AMOEBA force field with a linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for implicit solvent and polarization modeling. To solve the PM-PB model, we designed a regularized Matched Interface and Boundary (MIB) method to analytically regularizes the singular source term in the PMPB model while maintains 2nd order accuracy by rigorously treating the interface conditions. The accuracy of the method is validated on Kirkwood sphere with available analytical solutions and on proteins whose charge distribution are assigned using AMOEBA force field.</description>

      <title>Nodal Count for Orthogonally Invariant Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nodal count of eigenvectors of random matrices interpreted as operators on signed complete graphs. Our focus is on orthogonally invariant ensembles, with particular attention to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). We establish that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the distribution of nodal counts converges to the same limiting law as the eigenvalue distribution. In the GOE case, this limit is the semicircle law. This result refutes a conjecture, motivated by quantum chaos and quantum graphs, which predicted Gaussian behavior of the nodal count.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Insulated Diode: Existence of Solutions and Complex Bifurcation. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to avoid the electron oscillation of the cathode and enhance the work efficiency of a vacuum diode, an approach for analyzing the solutions and complex bifurcation has been proposed and used to determine the optimal trajectory of electron motion of the vacuum diode. This work is focusing on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation in a space-charge-limited vacuum diode, modeled by a singularly perturbed 1.5-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell system. We focus on the insulated regime, characterized by the reflection of electrons back toward the cathode at a point $x^{*}.$ The analysis proceeds in two primary stages. First, the original Vlasov-Maxwell system is reduced to a nonlinear singular system of ordinary differential equations governing the electric and magnetic field potentials. Subsequently, this system is further reduced to a novel nonlinear singular ODE for an effective potential $\theta(x).$ The existence of non-negative solutions to this final equation is established on the interval $[0, x^{*})$, where $\theta(x)&gt;0$. This is achieved by reformulating the associated initial value problem into a system of coupled nonlinear Fredholm integral equations and proving the existence of fixed points for the corresponding operators. The most significant and previously unexplored case occurs when $\theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$, which corresponds to the fully insulated diode. For this regime, we present a novel numerical analysis of complex solution bifurcations, examining their dependence on system parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams illustrating the solution $\theta(x)$ as a function of the free boundary $x^{*}$ is constructed, and the insulated diode spacing is determined.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli, Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local "decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models, stability of data distributions implies the existence of computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Single-Sided Black Holes in Double-Scaled SYK Model and No Man's Island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single-sided black hole with an end-of-the-world (EoW) brane behind horizon in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. The new Hamiltonian is a deformation of the original DSSYK Hamiltonian with an additional exponential wormhole length operator, which leads to a new chord diagram rule. The boundary algebra is defined as generated by the new Hamiltonian and boundary matter, analogous to the original DSSYK. There is an alternative definition with a $q$-coherent state, which can be shown to be equivalent to the former by a nontrivial isomorphism of the von Neumann algebra of DSSYK. This isomorphism induces an unitary equivalence, which yields a surprising result that the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole in DSSYK has a non-trivial commutant and is still a type $\text{II}_1$ von Neumann factor. It follows that the full bulk reconstruction from the boundary is impossible, and we demonstrate that the non-trivial commutant leads to the existence of a ``no man's island" behind the horizon in the semiclassical JT gravity limit. We take a few different ways to understand the nontrivial commutant of the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole. We show that the commutant is indeed non-geometric in the sense of being complex on chord number basis. In the semiclassical JT limit, the commutant becomes the canonical purification of the boundary algebra and claims the no man's island. Comparing with the Hawking radiation process after Page time, the unitary equivalence can be interpreted as the encoding map from the canonical purification to the old Hawking radiation, and thus the no man's island has the same essence as the island. We also show an extension of the boundary algebra to all bounded operators by including an additional exponential wormhole length operator.</description>

      <title>Translation invariant defects as an extension of topological symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern way to understand symmetries of a quantum field theory is via its topological defects in various dimensions. In this contribution to the proceedings we focus on line defects in 2d QFT and we point out that topological defects naturally embed into a larger class, namely translation invariant defects. The latter still allow for non-singular fusion and one obtains a monoidal category of translation invariant defects which contains that of topological defects as a full subcategory. We give a simple perturbative description of translation invariant defects in a perturbed conformal field theory via chiral three-dimensional topological field theory. We show in the example of the Ising CFT and the Lee-Yang CFT that even if no topological defects survive the deformation, some translation invariant defects still do.</description>

      <title>Banach Poisson-Lie groups, Lax equations and the AKS theorem in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the theory of $R$-brackets, Baxter brackets and Nijenhuis brackets in the Banach setting, in particular in relation with Banach Poisson-Lie groups. The notion of Banach Lie--Poisson space with respect to an arbitrary duality pairing is crucial for the equations of motion to make sense. In the presence of a non-degenerate invariant pairing on a Banach Lie algebra, these equations of motion assume a Lax form. We prove a version of the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem adapted to $R$-matrices on infinite-dimensional Banach algebras. Applications to the resolution of Lax equations associated to some Banach Manin triples are given. The semi-infinite Toda lattice is also presented as an example of this approach.</description>

      <title>Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop groups and Drinfeld double of preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the following results: Given the Drinfeld double $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ of the localised preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+}_{Q}$ of quiver type $Q$ with the Cartan elements, there is a $\mathbb{Q}(q,t_e)_{e\in E}$-Hopf algebra isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ and the localised Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ of quiver type $Q$. Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,-,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the opposite algebra of the integral nilpotent $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$. As a result, one can identify the universal $R$-matrix for the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}$ of the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$ in $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ with the wall $R$-matrix of the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ in $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$.
  Moreover, under the integrality conjecture for the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,+,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the limit of large loops.</description>

      <title>On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -yet preserving the same resolution- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -analytically- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -numerically- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.</description>

Using the Hayward-Kodama formalism, we treat a collapsing sphere as a thermodynamic system and express the surface gravity $\kappa_{hk}$ in terms of the geometric variables. We derive the specific heat capacities and identify a critical condition $\dot{\kappa}_{hk} = 0$ as the locus of second order phase transition during the collapse. Through specific examples, we demonstrate that the condition is independent of singular/non-singular nature of the geometry. We also find that the critical condition of phase transition is equivalent to a stationary condition of the expansion of null congruence. This establishes a direct correspondence between geometric stability and thermodynamic criticality, allowing the identification of apparent horizon as a universal critical surface in the phase-space of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out a correspondence between the Jackiw--Teitelboim (JT) gravity and the stationary measure of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation on an interval. By relating the Schwarzian limit of the double-scaled SYK to the weakly asymmetric limit of the open ASEP, we establish that the path-integral measure defining the Euclidean evolution between two end-of-the-world branes in JT gravity can be interpreted as the stationary measure of the KPZ equation on an interval with Neumann boundary conditions. We also establish the match between correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Haldane-Inspired Generalized Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to as \emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the hyperbosonic regime for $\alpha &lt; 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\alpha$. Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$ depends universally on $\alpha$. For negative $\alpha$, corresponding to hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in statistical thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the accelerated expansion of the Universe at late times is caused by a temporally changing dark energy component, rather than the constant one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In this context quintessence, i.e. a canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, plays a prominent role. There are, however, three main types of quintessence models: thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence. Dynamical systems reformulations of the field equations for a broad set of scalar field potentials, including some new ones, allow us to use dynamical systems methods to derive global and asymptotic features, visualised in bounded state space pictures clearly illustrating the relationships and properties of the different types of quintessence, clarifying initial data issues, and yielding simple and accurate approximations.</description>

Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of co-algebra, co-algebraic Wess-Zumino-Witten formulation of Lagrangian Field Theory and the Homotopy transfer theorem to many strings and particle systems. We discuss in detail the construction of higher dimensional co-algebras and the computational methods derived from them with a special interest regarding String Field Theory and Quantum Field Theory. As a result of this work we will be able to effortlessly extend some of the newly developed tools to study the algebraic structure, compute effective actions and compute scattering amplitudes of more complicated QFTs.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, using a technique introduced by P.~T.~Nam in 2012 and the {\it Coulomb Uncertainty Principle}, we prove new bounds on the excess charge for non relativistic atomic systems, independent of the particle statistics. These new bounds are the best bounds to date for bosonic systems for all values of the atomic number $Z$ and they are also the best bounds for fermionic systems with $Z \le 26$ (i.e., up to the chemical element {\it iron})</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantum Curve for strip geometries, Topological Recursion and open GW/DT invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open topological string partition function gives rise to open Gromov-Witten invariants, open Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 3D-5D BPS indices. Utilizing the remodelling conjecture which connects topological recursion and topological string theory, in this paper we study open topological string theory for the subclass of toric Calabi-Yau threefold known as strip geometries. For this purpose, certain new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through this we derive the open topological string partition function and also the associated quantum curve. We also explain how this is related to the open Donaldson-Thomas partition function associated with certain symmetric quivers, exponential networks and $q$-Barnes type integrals. In the process, we also connect how 3D-5D wall crossing affects these partition functions as one varies $x$, in examples.</description>

Abstract: We study one-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau type Fermat polynomial singularities along degree-one directions. We show that twisted sectors in the vanishing cohomology are components of automorphic forms for certain triangular groups. We prove consequentially that genus zero Gromov-Witten generating series of the corresponding Fermat Calabi-Yau varieties are components of automorphic forms. The main tools we use are mixed Hodge structures for quasi-homogeneous polynomial singularities, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and genus zero mirror symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify periodic $Y$-systems of rank 2 satisfying the symplectic property. We find that there are six such $Y$-systems. In all cases, the periodicity follows from the existence of two reddening sequences associated with the time evolution of the $Y$-systems in positive and negative directions, which gives rise to quantum dilogarithm identities associated with Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We also consider $q$-series called the Nahm sums associated with these $Y$-systems. We see that they are included in Zagier's list of rank 2 Nahm sums that are likely to be modular functions. It was recently shown by Wang that they are indeed modular functions.</description>

      <title>Non-saturation of Bootstrap Bounds by Hyperbolic Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years the conformal bootstrap has produced surprisingly tight bounds on many non-perturbative CFTs. It is an open question whether such bounds are indeed saturated by these CFTs. A toy version of this question appears in a recent application of the conformal bootstrap to hyperbolic orbifolds, where one finds bounds on Laplace eigenvalues that are exceptionally close to saturation by explicit orbifolds. In some instances, the bounds agree with the actual values to 11 significant digits. In this work we show, under reasonable assumptions about the convergence of numerics, that these bounds are not in fact saturated. In doing so, we find formulas for the OPE coefficients of hyperbolic orbifolds, using links between them and the Rankin-Cohen brackets of modular forms.</description>

Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Linearization-Based Feedback Stabilization of McKean-Vlasov PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a feedback control framework for stabilizing the McKean-Vlasov PDE on the torus. Our goal is to steer the dynamics toward a prescribed stationary distribution or accelerate convergence to it using a time-dependent control potential. We reformulate the controlled PDE in a weighted, zero-mean space and apply the ground-state transform to obtain a Schrodinger-type operator. The resulting operator framework enables spectral analysis, verification of the infinite-dimensional Hautus test, and construction of a Riccati-based feedback law derived from the linearized dynamics, yielding local exponential stabilization with a chosen convergence rate. We rigorously prove local exponential stabilization via maximal regularity arguments and nonlinear estimates. Numerical experiments on well-studied models in one and two dimensions (the noisy Kuramoto model for synchronization, the O(2) spin model in a magnetic field, and the von Mises attractive interaction potential) showcase the effectiveness of our control strategy, demonstrating convergence acceleration and stabilization of unstable equilibria.</description>

      <title>Planar percolation and the loop O(n) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of site percolation processes on any planar graph contains either zero or infinitely many infinite connected components. The assumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG) and that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of closed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter $p\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm from 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly amenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.
  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal lattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\in [1,2]$ and $x\in [1/\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured to be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven in such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop O(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to quenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models.</description>

      <title>A Trace-Path Integral Formula over Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an arithmetic path integral over the $\ell$-torsion of a Jacobian $J[\ell]$ is equal to the trace of the Frobenius action on a representation of the Heisenberg group $H(J[\ell])$, up to an explicitly determined sign. This is an arithmetic analogue of trace--path integral formulae which arise in quantum field theory, where path integrals over a space of sections of a fibration over a circle can be expressed as the trace of the monodromy action on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>

      <title>Localisation with on-shell supersymmetry algebras via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: Localisation as gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism provides a powerful technique to deal with gauge and global (super)symmetries that may only hold on shell. We argue that, since global (super)symmetries and gauge symmetries appear on an equal footing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, similarly localisation with respect to global (super)symmetries appears on an equal footing with gauge fixing of gauge symmetries; in general, when the gauge-fixing condition is not invariant under the global symmetries, localisation (with respect to a localising fermion) and gauge fixing (with respect to a gauge-fixing fermion) combine into a single operation. Furthermore, this perspective enables supersymmetric localisation using only on-shell supermultiplets, dispensing with auxiliary fields, extending an insight first discovered by Losev and Lysov arXiv:2312.13999. We provide the first examples of on-shell localisation for quantum field theories (together with a companion paper by Arvanitakis arXiv:2511.00144).</description>
