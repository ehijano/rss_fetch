      <description>arXiv:2411.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, $D$-meson, $B$-meson, and nucleon physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the nuclear and particle physics communities. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \to \pi$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\pi$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. We review the determinations of nucleon charges from the matrix elements of both isovector and flavour-diagonal axial, scalar and tensor local quark bilinears, and momentum fraction, helicity moment and the transversity moment from one-link quark bilinears. We also review determinations of scale-setting quantities. Finally, in this review we have added a new section on the general definition of the low-energy limit of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\eta_c$ using a method without momentum extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-independent method to calculate the radiative transition without the momentum extrapolation for the off-shell transition factors. The on-shell transition factor is directly obtained from the lattice hadronic function. We apply the method to calculate the charmonium radiative transition $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\eta_c$. After a continuous extrapolation under three lattice spacings, we obtain the on-shell transition factor as $V(0)=1.90(4)$, where the error is the statistical error that already takes into account the $a^2$-error in the continuous extrapolation. Finally, we determine the branching fraction of $J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma \eta_c$ as $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma\eta_c)=2.49(11)_{\textrm{lat}}(5)_{\textrm{exp}}$, where the second error comes from the uncertainty of $J/\psi$ total decay width $92.6(1.7)$ keV.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent and present new results on thermalization of nonabelian gauge theory obtained by exact numerical simulation of the real-time dynamics of two-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We discuss: (1) tests confirming the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis; (2) the entanglement entropy of sublattices, including the Page curve, the transition from area to volume scaling with increasing energy of the eigenstate and its time evolution that shows thermalization of localized regions to be a two-step process; (3) the absence of quantum many-body scars for $j_{\rm max}&gt;1/2$; (4) the spectral form factor, which exhibits the expected slope-ramp-plateau structure for late times; (5) the entanglement Hamiltonian for SU(2), which has properties in accordance with the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem; and (6) a measure for non-stabilizerness or "magic" that is found to reach its maximum during thermalization. We conclude that the thermalization of nonabelian gauge theories is a promising process to establish quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of GPDs from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) that is valid for all skewness. Our approach leverages conformal moments, representing them as the sum of spin-j nucleon A-form factor and skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor, derived from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces consistent with Lorentz invariance and unitarity. This model-independent framework, satisfying the polynomiality condition due to Lorentz invariance, uses Mellin moments from empirical data to estimate these form factors. With just five Regge slope parameters, our method accurately produces various nucleon quark GPD types and symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs through pertinent Mellin-Barnes integrals. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data, promising to improve the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, by avoiding the deconvolution problem at any skewness, for the first time.</description>

      <title>Improved analysis of strong-interaction-stable doubly-bottom tetraquarks on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We update earlier lattice results for the binding energies of the flavor antitriplet of strong-interaction-stable doubly bottom, $J^P=1^+$ tetraquarks, employing an extended sink construction which produces significantly improved ground-state effective-mass plateaus, as well as new, larger-volume ensembles which reduce possible finite-volume effects at lighter pion masses. The updated bindings are $115(17)$ MeV for the $I=0$ member of the antitriplet and $47(8)$ MeV for its $I=1/2$ partner. We also provide an update of our earlier study of the variable heavy mass dependence of binding in the $1^+$ channel and new results on this dependence for binding in the $0^+$ channel, accessible when the two heavy quarks have unequal masses. Implications of these results of potential relevance to experimental searches for signals of the production of doubly bottom tetraquarks and/or a possible bottom-charm partner of the $T_{cc}$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Multi-Lattice Sampling of Quantum Field Theories via Neural Operator-based Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00828v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling lattice field configurations on a lattice from the Boltzmann distribution corresponding to some action. Since such densities arise as approximationw of an underlying functional density, we frame the task as an instance of operator learning. We propose to approximate a time-dependent neural operator whose time integral provides a mapping between the functional distributions of the free and target theories. Once a particular lattice is chosen, the neural operator can be discretized to a finite-dimensional, time-dependent vector field which in turn induces a continuous normalizing flow between finite dimensional distributions over the chosen lattice. This flow can then be trained to be a diffeormorphism between the discretized free and target theories on the chosen lattice, and, by construction, can be evaluated on different discretizations of spacetime. We experimentally validate the proposal on the 2-dimensional $\phi^4$-theory to explore to what extent such operator-based flow architectures generalize to lattice sizes they were not trained on, and show that pretraining on smaller lattices can lead to a speedup over training directly on the target lattice size.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge Higgs theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>
