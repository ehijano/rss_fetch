      <title>Stochastic Lorenz dynamics and wind reversals in Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorenz equations [1] are a severe Galerkin-truncation of the Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) equations describing Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Here we examine the mathematical connections between the chaotic lobe-switching behavior of a stochastic form of the Lorenz equations, that model the interaction between the thermal boundary layers and the core circulation, and the mean wind reversals in the experiments of Sreenivasan et al. [2]. Long-time numerical simulations of these stochastic equations, not easily accessible with the OB equations, yield a probability distribution for lobe inter-switch timings that exhibits non-Gaussian, multifractal behavior. In the Gaussian frequency range the simulations mirror the laboratory measurements and the classical Hurst exponent and quadratic variation show Brownian second-moment statistics. Further scrutiny reveals a non-linear cumulant generating function, or moment-exponent function, and thus multifractality. A simple generalized two-scale Cantor-cascade analysis reproduces these properties, showing that multiplicative intermittency, characteristic of turbulence, strongly influences the statistics. This demonstrates that this stochastic Lorenz system is a faithful, low-dimensional surrogate for mean-wind reversals in RBC.</description>

      <title>Singular jets in free-falling droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on singular jets in a free-falling liquid tin droplet following nanosecond laser-pulse impact. Following impact, the droplet (with diameter $D_0=50$ or 70\,$\mu$m) undergoes rapid radial expansion and subsequent retraction, resulting in the formation of an axisymmetric jet. Using numerical simulations in tandem with our experiments, we reveal that a delicate interplay between radial flow and the curvature of the retracting droplet governs jet formation. The resulting dynamics is characterized using the impact Weber number, $\We$ (in the experiments $2 \lesssim \We \lesssim 16$), and a pressure width, W (typically $1 \lesssim \W \lesssim 2$), which describes the angular distribution over the droplet surface of the instantaneous pressure impulse exerted by the transient laser-produced plasma. %, within the range $0-20$. For values $\We&lt;10$, the droplet presents a pronounced forward curvature during the retraction, leading to the formation of a cavity. The collapse of such a cavity leads to a singular jet that greatly enhances the jetting velocity up to ten times the impact propulsion velocity, an effect that narrowly peaks around $\We\sim6-8$, reminiscent of singular jets in droplet-solid impact. We identify a further sensitivity of the jet velocity enhancement on the pressure width W and capture the dynamics in a phase diagram connecting the various deformation morphologies with jet velocity.</description>

      <title>Combined dynamic-kinematic validation of droplet-wall impact modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many numerical studies validate droplet wall impact using only maximum spreading diameter, yet this metric alone cannot ensure correct droplet dynamics. We present a combined dynamic contact angle (DCA) model that merges the geometric accuracy of the generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law with the kinematic consistency of a Hoffman function-based approach, improving predictions of droplet spreading and receding. We simulate water-glycerol droplet impact on sapphire glass at Weber numbers 20 -- 250 and assess both contact angle formulations. Simulated radial velocity fields are processed in Python using SciPy and compared with Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in the longitudinal section of the spreading droplet. The Hoffman function-based model captures the main droplet kinematic trends and provides more consistent receding dynamics. The generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law matches the maximum spreading diameter within 7%. However, during receding, it shows a median absolute error in radial velocity up to three times higher than that of the Hoffman function-based solution. Average radial velocity and spreading velocity can differ from experimental trends even when maximum spreading is reproduced. These findings support validation combining geometric and kinematic metrics and motivate the combined model for predicting spreading and receding. Using the maximum spreading factor $\beta_{max}$ as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter over the initial droplet diameter and the characteristic capillary number $Ca_{char}$ defined from the mean internal horizontal velocity at 300 micrometer above the substrate, we introduce a $(\beta_{max},\,Ca_{char})$ diagram to relate spreading characteristics to internal flow dynamics. We hypothesize that, given sufficient data, the contact-line geometry may be used to estimate internal kinematics.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Buffet Effects Induced by Ultrahigh Bypass Ratio Nacelle Installation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsteady shock-boundary-layer interaction on the lower surface of a transport-aircraft wing can be caused or amplified by ultrahigh-bypass-ratio underwing nacelle installation. This work analyzes the resulting buffet dynamics on the Airbus XRF-1 configuration at a Mach number of $0.84$, a Reynolds number of $3.3\times 10^6$, and $-4^\circ$ angle of attack using scale-resolving delayed detached eddy simulations and unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurements. Coherent structures are extracted employing a data-efficient multi-taper spectral POD. Dominant modes occur in the Strouhal number range $St \in [0.1,0.3]$. Surface modes reveal wave-like shock motions that originate near the pylon-wing intersection and propagate inboard towards the fuselage. These shock oscillations are linked to unsteady flow separation downstream of the shock. Additional dominant modes show spanwise oscillations of the separated flow region and shock oscillations phase-linked to shear layer instabilities. The modal analysis of volume data reveals pressure waves connected to these modes traveling upstream above and below the wing.</description>

      <title>A fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on orthogonal central moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal fluctuations play a central role in fluid dynamics at mesoscopic scales and must be incorporated into numerical schemes in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics. In this work, we develop a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on an orthogonal central-moments-based representation. Stochastic forcing is introduced directly in the space of central moments (CMs) and consistently paired with mode-dependent relaxation, yielding a discrete kinetic model that satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at the lattice level. Owing to the orthogonality of the basis, the equilibrium covariance matrix of the central moments is diagonal, and each non-conserved mode can be interpreted as an independent discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with variance fixed by equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting formulation guarantees exact equipartition of kinetic energy at equilibrium, preserves Galilean invariance, and retains the enhanced numerical stability characteristic of CMs-based collision operators. Explicit fluctuating schemes are constructed for the D2Q9 and D3Q27 lattices. The extension to reduced-velocity discretisation is discussed too. A comprehensive set of numerical tests verifies correct thermalisation, isotropy of equilibrium statistics, and the expected scaling of velocity fluctuations with thermal energy, density, and relaxation time. In contrast to fluctuating BGK formulations, the present method remains stable and well posed in the over-relaxation regime, including in the immediate vicinity of the stability limit. These results demonstrate that CMs-based lattice Boltzmann methods provide a natural and robust framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics, in which dissipation, noise, and kinetic mode structure are consistently aligned at the discrete level.</description>

      <title>Multifluid Hydrodynamic Simulation of Metallic-Plate Collision Using the VOF Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study is concerned with a one-dimensional problem in explosive welding that pertains to the collision of lead and steel plates. The metal plates and the surrounding air are represented as separate immiscible phases governed by independent equations of state. A multifluid Godunov-type (finite-volume) computational algorithm, based on the mechanical-equilibrium Euler equations and incorporating pressure relaxation, is used to numerically describe the evolution of the waves resulting from the collision. The position of the interface (contact discontinuity) between immiscible phases is tracked by means of the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The numerical model allows one to account for the existence of tensile stresses in metal and registers them as regions of negative pressure. The computed arrival time of the unloading wave at the interface between the plates agrees with the experimental data and with simulation results obtained via different methods.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric cavities in hypersonic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16663v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed experimental campaign is conducted to investigate the shear layer characteristics of an axisymmetric open cavity exposed to a Mach $6$ freestream. Experiments are performed in a Ludwieg tunnel for varying Reynolds numbers ($23000\leq Re_D \leq 74000$) based on cavity depth ($D$). The effects of geometry are examined through length-to-depth ratios ($[L/D]=[2,4,6]$) and non-dimensional rear-face height differences ($[\Delta h/D]=[-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5]$). Shear layer evolution is interpreted using qualitative schlieren and Planar Laser Rayleigh Scattering (PLRS) along with quantitative unsteady pressure measurements. For all $[L/D]$, the shear layer remains laminar at low $Re_D$ and develops Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortices as $Re_D$ increases. For the longest cavity ($[L/D]=6$), transition to turbulence occurs at the highest $Re_D$ due to a longer K-H growth length. Spectral analysis of pressure signals and PLRS intensity shows a shift in dominant frequency from the first Rossiter mode to higher modes for $[L/D]=6$. Except for $[L/D]=6, [\Delta h/D]=0$, dominant frequencies agree with Rossiter predictions and remain largely Reynolds-number independent. Variation of $[\Delta h/D]$ leads to mode switching identified using POD of PLRS snapshots. Negative $[\Delta h/D]$ favors K-H modes (5th-6th Rossiter), whereas positive values promote a strong flapping mode (1st Rossiter) due to pressure build-up inside the cavity. At $[\Delta h/D]=0$, both modes may coexist depending on $Re_D$. Azimuthal measurements indicate dominant axisymmetric behavior in flapping cases and weaker correlation for K-H dominated shear layers.</description>

      <title>Distributed physics-informed neural networks via domain decomposition for fast flow reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-local physics-informed neural networks for forward and inverse solutions of granular flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense granular flows exhibit nonlocal effects due to stress transmission in microplastic events, especially in quasi-static or slowly sheared regions. Hence, traditional local rheological models fail to capture spatial cooperativity effects that are prominent in many granular systems. The nonlocal granular fluidity (NGF) model addresses this limitation by introducing a diffusive-like partial differential equation for a fluidity field, governed by a key material-dependent parameter: the nonlocal amplitude A. However, determining A from experiments or simulations is known to be difficult and typically requires extensive calibration across multiple geometries. In this work, we present a data-driven platform based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embedded with the NGF model, capable of solving granular flows in a forward or inverse manner. We show that once trained on transient flow fields, these non-local PINNs can readily infer the material parameters, as well as the pressure and stress fields. These data-driven frameworks allow for accurate recovery of small variations in the nonlocal amplitude, A, which lead to sharp bifurcation-like transitions in the flow field. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven parameter inference in complex nonlocal models and opens up new possibilities for characterizing granular materials from sparse experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Ponomarenko dynamo sustained by a free swirling jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical results on dynamo action in a flow driven by an azimuthal body force localized near the end of an elongated cylindrical container. The analysis focuses on the central region of the cylinder, where axial variations in the flow are relatively weak, allowing the magnetic field to be represented as a helically traveling wave. Four magnetic impeller configurations and multiple forcing intensities are examined. In all cases, the velocity profiles in the central region display a similar \propto r^{-2} dependence across a wide range of Reynolds numbers and forcing region widths. The magnetic field is found to start growing under conditions similar to those of the Riga dynamo. However, the growing modes exhibit a substantial nonzero group velocity, indicating that the associated instability is convective: the flow can amplify an externally applied magnetic field but cannot sustain it autonomously. We outline several approaches for overcoming this limitation in order to realize a working laboratory dynamo based on an internally unconstrained swirling jet-type flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of a three-dimensional contractile fluid droplet in the bulk and under confinement. We show that varying activity leads to a variety of shapes and motile regimes whose motion is driven by an interplay between spontaneous flows and elasticity. In the bulk the droplet self-propels unidirectionally, acquiring either an almost spherical shape at intermediate activity or a peanut-like geometry for larger values. Under confinement, the droplet exhibits a previously unreported oscillating dynamics characterized by periodic hits against opposite walls of a microchannel while moving forward. These results could be of interest for the study of artificial microswimmers and their biological analogs, such as living cells.</description>

      <title>WindDensity-MBIR: Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction for Wind Tunnel 3D Density Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimentalists often use wind tunnels to study aerodynamic turbulence, but most wind tunnel imaging techniques are limited in their ability to take non-invasive 3D density measurements of turbulence. Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sampling for Hydrodynamic Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive sampling approach for efficient detection of bifurcation boundaries in parametrized fluid flow problems is presented herein. The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester~(J. Comput. Phys., 553 (2026), 114743), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of damped-driven wave turbulence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous justification of various kinetic regimes exhibited by the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an additive stochastic forcing and a viscous dissipation. The importance of such damped-driven models stems from their wide empirical use in studying turbulence for nonlinear wave systems. The force injects energy into the system at large scales, which is then transferred across scales, thanks to the nonlinear wave interactions, until it is eventually dissipated at smaller scales. The presence of such scale-separated forcing and dissipation allows for the constant flux of energy in the intermediate scales, known as the inertial range, which is the focus of the vast amount of numerical and physical literature on wave turbulence.
  Roughly speaking, our results provide a rigorous kinetic framework for this turbulent behavior by proving that the stochastic dynamics can be effectively described by a deterministic damped-driven kinetic equation, which carries the full picture of the turbulent energy dynamic across scales (like cascade spectra or other flux solutions). The analysis extends previous works in the unperturbed setting arXiv:1912.09518-arXiv:2301.07063 to the above empirically motivated damped driven setting. Here, in addition to the size $L$ of the system, and the strength $\lambda$ of the nonlinearity, an extra thermodynamic parameter has to be included in the kinetic limit ($L\to \infty, \lambda\to 0$), namely the strength $\nu$ of the forcing and dissipation. Various regimes emerge depending on the relative sizes of $L$, $\lambda$ and $\nu$, which give rise to different kinetic equations. Two major novelties of this work is the extension of the Feynman diagram analysis to additive stochastic objects, and the sharp asymptotic development of the leading terms in that expansion.</description>
