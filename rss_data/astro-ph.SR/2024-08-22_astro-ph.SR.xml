      <title>Time-Evolution Images of the Hypergiant RW Cephei During the Re-brightening Phase Following the Great Dimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars with initial masses larger than 8 solar masses undergo substantial mass loss through mechanisms that remain elusive. Unraveling the origins of this mass loss is important for comprehending the evolutionary path of these stars, the type of supernova explosion and whether they become neutron stars or black hole remnants. In 2022 December, RW Cep experienced the Great Dimming in its visible brightness, presenting a unique opportunity to understand mass loss mechanisms. Our previous observations of RW Cep from the CHARA Array, taken during the dimming phase, show a compelling asymmetry in the star images, with a darker zone on the west side of the star indicating presence of dust in front of the star in our line of sight. Here, we present multi-epoch observations from CHARA while the star re-brightened in 2023. We created images using three image reconstruction methods and an analytical model fit. Comparisons of images acquired during the dimming and re-brightening phases reveal remarkable differences. Specifically, the west side of RW Cep, initially obscured during the dimming phase, reappeared during the subsequent re-brightening phase and the measured angular diameter became larger by 8%. We also observed image changes from epoch to epoch while the star is brightening indicating the time evolution of dust in front of the star. We suggest that the dimming of RW Cep was a result from a recent surface mass ejection event, generating a dust cloud that partially obstructed the stellar photosphere.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) V. The launching mechanism of protostellar winds via water masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the launching mechanism of winds and jets remains one of the fundamental challenges in astrophysics. The Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey has recently mapped the 3D velocity field of the protostellar winds in a sample (37) of luminous young stellar objects (YSOs) at scales of 10-100 au via very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the 22 GHz water masers. In most of the targets, the distribution of the 3D maser velocities can be explained in terms of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind (DW). We have performed Very Long Baseline Array observations of the 22 GHz water masers in IRAS 21078+5211, the most promising MHD DW candidate from the POETS survey, to determine the 3D velocities of the gas flowing along several wind streamlines previously identified at a linear resolution of ~1 au. Near the YSO at small separations along ($xl \le 150$ au) and across ($R \le 40$ au) the jet axis, water masers trace three individual DW streamlines. By exploiting the 3D kinematic information of the masers, we determined the launch radii of these streamlines with an accuracy of $\sim$1 au, and they lie in the range of 10-50 au. At increasingly greater distances along the jet (110 au $\le xl \le 220$ au), the outflowing gas speeds up while it collimates close to the jet axis. Magneto-centrifugal launching in a radially extended MHD DW appears to be the only viable process to explain the fast (up to 60 km/s) and collimated (down to 10 degree) velocities of the wind in correspondence with launch radii ranging between 10 and 50 au. At larger separations from the jet axis ($R \ge 100$ au), the water masers trace a slow ($\le$20 km/s), radially expanding arched shock-front with kinematics inconsistent with magneto-centrifugal launching. Our resistive-magnetohydrodynamical simulations indicate that this shock-front could be driven by magnetic pressure.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Disk Formation Regimes: Angular Momentum Conservation versus Magnetic Braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protostellar disks around young protostars exhibit diverse properties, with their radii ranging from less than ten to several hundred au. To investigate the mechanisms shaping this disk radius distribution, we compiled a sample of 27 Class 0 and I single protostars with resolved disks and dynamically determined protostellar masses from the literature. Additionally, we derived the radial profile of the rotational to gravitational energy ratio in dense cores from the observed specific angular momentum profiles in the literature. Using these observed protostellar masses and rotational energy profile, we computed theoretical disk radii from the hydrodynamic and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models in Lee et al. (2021, 2024) and generated synthetic samples to compare with the observations. In our theoretical model, the disk radii are determined by hydrodynamics when the central protostar+disk mass is low. After the protostars and disks grow and exceed certain masses, the disk radii become regulated by magnetic braking and non-ideal MHD effects. The synthetic disk radius distribution from this model matches well with the observations. This result suggests that hydrodynamics and non-ideal MHD can be dominant in different mass regimes (or evolutionary stages) depending on the rotational energy and protostar+disk mass. This model naturally explains the rarity of large (&gt;100 au) disks and the presence of very small (&lt;10 au) disks. It also predicts that the majority of protostellar disks have radii of a few tens of au, as observed.</description>

      <title>Minute-Cadence Observations of the LAMOST Fields with the TMTS: IV -- Catalog of Cataclysmic Variables from the First 3-yr Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tsinghua University--Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS) started to monitor the LAMOST plates in 2020, leading to the discovery of numerous short-period eclipsing binaries, peculiar pulsators, flare stars, and other variable objects. Here, we present the uninterrupted light curves for a sample of 64 cataclysmic variables (CVs) observed/discovered using the TMTS during its first three-year observations, and we introduce new CVs and new light-variation periods (from known CVs) revealed through the TMTS observations. Thanks to the high-cadence observations of TMTS, diverse light variations, including superhumps, quasi-periodic oscillations, large-amplitude orbital modulations, and rotational modulations, are able to be detected in our CV samples, providing key observational clues for understanding the fast-developing physical processes in various CVs. All of these short-timescale light-curve features help further classify the subtypes of CV systems. We highlight the light-curve features observed in our CV sample and discuss further implications of minute-cadence light curves for CV identifications and classifications. Moreover, we examine the H$\alpha$ emission lines in the spectra from our nonmagnetic CV samples (i.e., dwarf novae and nova-like subclasses) and find that the distribution of H$\alpha$ emission strength shows significant differences between the sources with orbital periods above and below the period gap, which agrees with the trend seen from the SDSS nonmagnetic CV sample.</description>

      <title>Variation of sunspot groups' polarity separation during their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the emergence of sunspot groups the footpoints of their leading and following parts move apart. This diverging motion results in the stretching of the active regions, which continues during the decay phase. The aim of the present work is to study the separation distance variations during the active region evolution on a large statistical sample. Altogether more than 2000 individual sunspot groups were taken into account. The investigation is mainly based on data of the SoHO/MDI - Debrecen Sunspot Data (SDD) catalog which covers the time span 1996-2010, practically the whole solar cycle 23. For check of the possible cyclical variation the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) is used which contains data for solar cycles 20-24. The separation distance is calculated between the leading and following centers of mass and starts to increase after the emergence and shows a plateau around the peak flux. The polarity separation reaches its maximum in the decay phase and then starts to decrease in the cases of the largest and medium size groups, but continues its increase in the case of the smallest groups. This decrease is caused by the eastward motion of the leading part, while the following part continues its backward motion. The separation distance is size dependent, i. e., the larger the sunspot group the greater its extent. Cycle and cycle phase dependencies as well as hemispheric connection can also be observed.</description>

      <title>Slowly positively drifting bursts generated by large-scale magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slowly positively drifting bursts (SPDBs) are rarely observed in radio emission of solar flares. To understand how the SPDBs are generated, we studied the radio observations at 600--5000 MHz together with the imaging observations made in ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) during the SPDB-rich C8.7 flare of 2014 May 10 (SOL2014-05-10T0702). Because the SPDBs propagate towards locations of higher plasma density, we studied their associations with individual flare kernels, located either within the flare core itself, or distributed at longer distances, but connected to the flaring region by large-scale hot loops. For each kernel we constructed light curves using 1600 A and 304 A observations and compared these light curves with the temporal evolution of radio flux at 1190 MHz, representing all observed groups of SPDBs. We also analysed the UV/EUV observations to understand the evolution of magnetic connectivity during the flare. The flare starts with a growing hot sigmoid observed in 131 A. As the sigmoid evolves, it extends to and interacts with a half dome present within the active region. The evolving sigmoid reconnects at the respective hyperbolic flux tube, producing large-scale magnetic connections and an EUV swirl. Three groups of SPDBs are observed during this large-scale magnetic reconnection, along with a group of narrow-band type III bursts. The light curves of a kernel corresponding to the footpoint of spine line analogue show good agreement with the radio flux at 1190 MHz, indicating that the SPDBs are produced by the large-scale magnetic reconnection at the half dome. In addition, one of the kernels appeared in the neighbouring active region and also showed a similar evolution to the radio flux, implying that beams of accelerated particles can synchronize radio and UV/EUV light curves across relatively large distances.</description>

      <title>Full non-LTE spectral line formation III. The case of a two-level atom with broadened upper level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider the full nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiation transfer problem. This formalism allows us to account for deviation from equilibrium distribution of both the radiation field and the massive particles. In the present study two-level atoms with broadened upper level represent the massive particles. In the absence of velocity-changing collisions, we demonstrate the analytic equivalence of the full non-LTE source function with the corresponding standard non-LTE partial frequency redistribution (PFR) model. We present an iterative method based on operator splitting techniques to numerically solve the problem at hand. We benchmark it against the standard non-LTE transfer problem for a two-level atom with PFR. We illustrate the deviation of the velocity distribution function of excited atoms from the equilibrium distribution. We also discuss the dependence of the emission profile and the velocity distribution function on elastic collisions and velocity-changing collisions.</description>

      <title>Orbits of Binary Stars: from Visual Measures to Speckle Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the orbits of visual binary stars has always been one of the fundamentals of astronomy. Based historically on the visual measures, nowadays the orbits rely more (or exclusively) on the accurate speckle data. This prompts reconsideration of the methods of orbit calculation, undertaken here and illustrated by 20 examples, from accurate to drastically revised and tentative orbits. Good understanding and critical assessment of the input data is a key requirement, especially concerning visual measures. Combination of visual and speckle data is still needed for long-period binaries, but the relative weights must match their respective errors. When the orbit can be fully constrained only by accurate speckle data, the old measures should be ignored. Orbits can be classified into three grades: A - fully constrained, B - semi-constrained, and C - preliminary or tentative. Typical use cases of visual orbits are listed. Accurate parallaxes from Gaia, together with the orbits, will greatly expand the data on stellar masses. Continued speckle monitoring will be an essential complement to Gaia, but the vast amount of new pairs will restrict future work on orbits to the most interesting or relevant objects.</description>

      <title>Ejecta masses in Type Ia Supernovae -- Implications for the Progenitor and the Explosion Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progenitor system(s) as well as the explosion mechanism(s) of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae are long-standing issues in astrophysics. Here we present ejecta masses and other physical parameters for 28 recent Type Ia supernovae inferred from multiband photometric and optical spectroscopic data. Our results confirm that the majority of SNe Ia show {\it observable} ejecta masses below the Chandrasekhar-limit (having a mean $M_{\rm ej} \approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$), consistent with the predictions of recent sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ explosion models. They are compatible with models assuming either single- or double-degenerate progenitor configurations. We also recover a sub-sample of supernovae within $1.2 $ M$_\odot$ $&lt; M_{\rm {ej}} &lt; 1.5$ M$_\odot$ that are consistent with near-Chandrasekhar explosions. Taking into account the uncertainties of the inferred ejecta masses, about half of our SNe are compatible with both explosion models. We compare our results with those in previous studies, and discuss the caveats and concerns regarding the applied methodology.</description>

      <title>Application of Convolutional Neural Networks to time domain astrophysics. 2D image analysis of OGLE light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years the amount of publicly available astronomical data has increased exponentially, with a remarkable example being large scale multiepoch photometric surveys. This wealth of data poses challenges to the classical methodologies commonly employed in the study of variable objects. As a response, deep learning techniques are increasingly being explored to effectively classify, analyze, and interpret these large datasets. In this paper we use two-dimensional histograms to represent Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) phasefolded light curves as images. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify variable objects within eight different categories (from now on labels): Classical Cepheid (CEP), RR Lyrae (RR), Long Period Variable (LPV), Miras (M), Ellipsoidal Binary (ELL), Delta Scuti (DST), Eclipsing Binary (E), and spurious class with Incorrect Periods (Rndm). We set up different training sets to train the same CNN architecture in order to characterize the impact of the training. The training sets were built from the same source of labels but different filters and balancing techniques were applied. Namely: Undersampling (U), Data Augmentation (DA), and Batch Balancing (BB). The best performance was achieved with the BB approach and a training sample size of $\sim$370000 stars. Regarding computational performance, the image representation production rate is of $\sim$76 images per core per second, and the time to predict is $\sim$ 60$\, \mu\text{s}$ per star. The accuracy of the classification improves from $\sim$ 92%, when based only on the CNN, to $\sim$ 98% when the results of the CNN are combined with the period and amplitude features in a two step approach. This methodology achieves comparable results with previous studies but with two main advantages: the identification of miscalculated periods and the improvement in computational time cost.</description>

      <title>Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations of Massive Stars in Gas-rich Environments: Accretion of AGN Stars Suppressed By Thermal Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars may form in or be captured into AGN disks. Recent 1D studies employing stellar-evolution codes have demonstrated the potential for rapid growth of such stars through accretion up to a few hundred $M_\odot$. We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of moderately massive stars' envelopes, in order to determine the rate and critical radius $R_{\rm crit}$ of their accretion process in an isotropic gas-rich environment in the absence of luminosity-driven mass loss. We find that in the ``fast-diffusion" regime where characteristic radiative diffusion speed $c/\tau$ is faster than the gas sound speed $c_s$, the accretion rate is suppressed by feedback from gravitational and radiative advection energy flux, in addition to the stellar luminosity. Alternatively, in the ``slow-diffusion" regime where $c/\tau&lt;c_s$, due to adiabatic accretion, the stellar envelope expands quickly to become hydrostatic and further net accretion occurs on thermal timescales in the absence of self-gravity. When the radiation entropy of the medium is less than that of the star, however, this hydrostatic envelope can become more massive than the star itself. Within this sub-regime, self-gravity of the envelope excites runaway growth. Applying our results to realistic environments, moderately massive stars ($\lesssim 100M_\odot$) embedded in AGN disks typically accrete in the fast-diffusion regime, leading to reduction of steady-state accretion rate 1-2 orders of magnitudes lower than expected by previous 1D calculations and $R_{\rm crit}$ smaller than the disk scale height, except in the opacity window at temperature $T\sim 2000$K. Accretion in slow diffusion regime occurs in regions with very high density $\rho\gtrsim 10^{-9}$g/cm$^3$, and needs to be treated with caution in 1D long-term calculations.</description>

      <title>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium $-$ X. Flash spectral features in the Type Ibn SN 2019cj and observations of SN 2018jmt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared observations of two Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj. Their light curves have rise times of about 10 days, reaching an absolute peak magnitude of $M_g$(SN 2018jmt) = $-$19.07 $\pm$ 0.37 and $M_V$(SN 2019cj) = $-$18.94 $\pm$ 0.19 mag, respectively. The early-time spectra of SN 2018jmt are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow (600$-$1000 km~s$^{-1}$) He I lines with P-Cygni profile. At later epochs, the spectra become more similar to those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc. At early phases, the spectra of SN 2019cj show flash ionisation emission lines of C III, N III and He II superposed on a blue continuum. These features disappear after a few days, and then the spectra of SN 2019cj evolve similarly to those of SN 2018jmt. The spectra indicate that the two SNe exploded within a He-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) lost by the progenitors a short time before the explosion. We model the light curves of the two SNe Ibn to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. The ejecta masses are consistent with either that expected for a canonical SN Ib ($\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) or those from a massive WR star ($&gt;$ $\sim$ 4 M$_{\odot}$), with the kinetic energy on the order of $10^{51}$ erg. The lower limit on the ejecta mass ($&gt;$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) argues against a scenario involving a relatively low-mass progenitor (e.g., $M_{ZAMS}$ $\sim$ 10 M$_{\odot}$). We set a conservative upper limit of $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ for the $^{56}$Ni masses in both SNe. From the light curve modelling, we determine a two-zone CSM distribution, with an inner, flat CSM component, and an outer CSM with a steeper density profile. The physical properties of SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj are consistent with those expected from the core collapse of relatively massive, stripped-envelope (SE) stars.</description>

      <title>Tilted Disk Precession and Negative Superhumps in HS 2325+8205: A Multi-Window Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04913</link>

Abstract: Tilted disk precession exists in different objects. Negative superhumps (NSHs) in cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are believed to arise from the interaction between the reverse precession of a tilted disk and the streams from the secondary star.Utilizing TESS photometry, we present a comprehensive investigation into the tilted disk precession and NSHs in the dwarf nova (DN) HS 2325+8205, employing eclipse minima, eclipse depths, NSH frequencies, and NSH amplitudes and the correlation between them as the windows. We identified NSHs with a period of 0.185671(17) days in HS 2325+8205. The NSH frequency exhibits variability with a period of 3.943(9) days, akin to the tilted disk precession period validated in novae-like stars (NLs, SDSS J0812) and intermediate polars (IPs, TV Col).The O-C of eclipse minima were similarly found to vary cyclically in period 4.135(5) days, characterized by a faster rise than fall. Furthermore, the NSH amplitude exhibits complex and diverse variations, which may be linked to changes in the disk radius, mass transfer rate, and the apparent area of the hot spot. For the first time in DNe, we observe bi-periodic variations in eclipse depth (P1= 4.131(4) d and P2= 2.065(2) d ~ Pprec/2), resembling those seen in IPs, suggesting that variations with P2 are not attributable to an accretion curtain, as previously suspected. Moreover, NSH amplitude and eclipse depth decrease with increasing NSH frequency, while NSH amplitude correlates positively with eclipse depth.These complex variations observed across multiple observational windows provide substantial evidence for understanding of tilted disk precession and NSHs.</description>

      <title>Merging Hierarchical Triple Black Hole Systems with Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions suggest that very massive stars have the potential to form through multiple collisions and eventually evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within Population III star clusters embedded in mini dark matter haloes. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f_{\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code \textsc{petar}. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on their merging inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the \textsc{tsunami} code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-3}$. The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Detectable merging inner BBHs for mHz GW detectors LISA/TianQin/Taiji concentrate within $z&lt;3$. More distant sources would be detectable for CE/ET/LIGO/KAGRA/DECIGO, which are sensitive from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$Hz to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ Hz. Furthermore, compared with merging isolated BBHs, merging inner BBHs affected by dynamical perturbations from tertiary BHs tend to have higher eccentricities, with a significant fraction of sources with eccentricities closing to 1 at mHz bands. GW observations would help constrain formation channels of merging BBHs, whether through isolated evolution or dynamical interaction, by examining eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear modulation of dispersive fast magnetosonic waves in an inhomogeneous rotating solar low-$\beta$ magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the modulation of fast magnetosonic waves (MSWs) in rotating inhomogeneous low-$\beta$ magnetoplasmas with the effects of gravitation and the Coriolis force. By employing the standard multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique (RPT), we derive a nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation that governs the evolution of slowly varying MSW envelopes. The fast MSW becomes dispersive by the effects of the Coriolis force in the fluid motion, and the magnetic field and density inhomogeneity effects favor the Jeans instability in self-gravitating plasmas in a larger domain of the wave number ($k$, below the Jeans critical wave number, $k_J$) than homogeneous plasmas. The relative influence of the Jeans frequency ($\omega_J$, associated with the gravitational force) and the angular frequency ($\Omega_0$, relating to the Coriolis force) on the Jeans carrier MSW mode and the modulational instability (MI) of the MSW envelope is studied. We show that the MSW envelope (corresponding to the unstable carrier Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ and $k&lt;k_J$) is always unstable against the plane wave perturbation with no cut-offs for growth rates. In contrast, the stable Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ but $k&gt;k_J$ manifests either modulational stability or MI having a finite growth rate before being cut off. We find an enhancement of the MI growth rate by the influence of magnetic field or density inhomogeneity. The case with constant gravity force (other than the self-gravity) perpendicular to the magnetic field is also briefly discussed to show that the fast magnetosonic carrier mode is always unstable, giving MI of slowly varying envelopes with no cut-offs for the growth rates. Possible applications of MI in solar plasmas, such as those in the X-ray corona, are also briefly discussed.</description>
