      <title>A Workflow for GLAM Metadata Crosswalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acquisition of physical artifacts not only involves transferring existing information into the digital ecosystem but also generates information as a process itself, underscoring the importance of meticulous management of FAIR data and metadata. In addition, the diversity of objects within the cultural heritage domain is reflected in a multitude of descriptive models. The digitization process expands the opportunities for exchange and joint utilization, granted that the descriptive schemas are made interoperable in advance. To achieve this goal, we propose a replicable workflow for metadata schema crosswalks that facilitates the preservation and accessibility of cultural heritage in the digital ecosystem. This work presents a methodology for metadata generation and management in the case study of the digital twin of the temporary exhibition "The Other Renaissance - Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World". The workflow delineates a systematic, step-by-step transformation of tabular data into RDF format, to enhance Linked Open Data. The methodology adopts the RDF Mapping Language (RML) technology for converting data to RDF with a human contribution involvement. This last aspect entails an interaction between digital humanists and domain experts through surveys leading to the abstraction and reformulation of domain-specific knowledge, to be exploited in the process of formalizing and converting information.</description>

      <title>TOPICAL: TOPIC Pages AutomagicaLly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic pages aggregate useful information about an entity or concept into a single succinct and accessible article. Automated creation of topic pages would enable their rapid curation as information resources, providing an alternative to traditional web search. While most prior work has focused on generating topic pages about biographical entities, in this work, we develop a completely automated process to generate high-quality topic pages for scientific entities, with a focus on biomedical concepts. We release TOPICAL, a web app and associated open-source code, comprising a model pipeline combining retrieval, clustering, and prompting, that makes it easy for anyone to generate topic pages for a wide variety of biomedical entities on demand. In a human evaluation of 150 diverse topic pages generated using TOPICAL, we find that the vast majority were considered relevant, accurate, and coherent, with correct supporting citations. We make all code publicly available and host a free-to-use web app at: https://s2-topical.apps.allenai.org</description>

      <title>Integrating measures of replicability into scholarly search: Challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Challenges to reproducibility and replicability have gained widespread attention, driven by large replication projects with lukewarm success rates. A nascent work has emerged developing algorithms to estimate the replicability of published findings. The current study explores ways in which AI-enabled signals of confidence in research might be integrated into the literature search. We interview 17 PhD researchers about their current processes for literature search and ask them to provide feedback on a replicability estimation tool. Our findings suggest that participants tend to confuse replicability with generalizability and related concepts. Information about replicability can support researchers throughout the research design processes. However, the use of AI estimation is debatable due to the lack of explainability and transparency. The ethical implications of AI-enabled confidence assessment must be further studied before such tools could be widely accepted. We discuss implications for the design of technological tools to support scholarly activities and advance replicability.</description>
