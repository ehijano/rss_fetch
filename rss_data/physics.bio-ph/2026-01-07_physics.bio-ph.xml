      <title>Holotomography in 2025: From Morphometric Imaging to AI-Driven Multimodal Phenotyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By 2025, holotomography (HT) has matured from a niche optical modality into a versatile platform for quantitative, label-free imaging in biomedicine. By reconstructing the three-dimensional refractive-index (RI) distribution of cells and tissues, HT enables high-resolution volumetric imaging with low phototoxicity and minimal sample perturbation. This Review surveys recent advances in the field and highlights three emerging directions: (i) the incorporation of deep-learning approaches for virtual staining, phenotypic classification, and automated analysis; (ii) the extension of HT to structurally complex biological systems, including organoids and thick tissue specimens; and (iii) the integration of HT with complementary modalities, such as Raman and polarization-sensitive microscopy, to enhance molecular and biophysical specificity. We summarize current HT applications spanning subcellular phenotyping, metabolic and mechanical profiling, and early-stage clinical studies in areas such as infectious disease and pathology. Finally, we discuss remaining technical and translational challenges and outline a roadmap for the prospective integration of HT into digital pathology and high-throughput screening workflows.</description>

      <title>Cellular wrapping of elastic particles by a supported lipid membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constancy of life vitally depends on the internalization of particles through biomembranes. Of particular interest, cellular uptake, including phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and membrane fusion, critically depends on the elasticity of particles. Cellular membranes are strongly linked to a supporting cytoskeleton. However, in most previous studies, the effect of this cortical network somehow is overlooked. In this paper, we study the cellular wrapping of a membrane around a 2D elastic particle in the presence of a substrate mimicking cytoskeleton. Our simulations show that the impact of particle flexibility on the wrapping process depends on the magnitude of the membrane particle adhesion. In contrast, the extent of membrane protrusions formed around the target always increases with target stiffness. Since the extension of membrane protrusions is an essential step in the phagocytosis process, this result may indicate a selective behavior of macrophages in the phagocytosis of aged red blood cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamical bicontinuous networks from 3D active phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using both numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations and cause the co-existing phases to interpenetrate, generating a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous steady-state morphology that persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</description>

      <title>Nutritional and growth enhancement of alfalfa sprouts through cold plasma and UV seed treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing eco-friendly techniques like cold plasma (CP) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation provides innovative approaches to enhance the sprout quality and productivity of alfalfa. This study explores the effects of CP and UV radiation on the germination, growth, and phytochemical profiles of alfalfa sprouts. CP significantly accelerated germination time, reducing median germination time by 8 hours compared to the control, and enhanced photo synthetic pigments, leading to higher biomass (25.87 mg/sprout fresh weight and 1.45 mg/sprout dry weight). UV treatments, particularly UV-C, increased chlorophyll and total flavonoid content. Overall, CP effectively promotes alfalfa germination and growth, while UV treatments improve specific phytochemicals.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</description>
