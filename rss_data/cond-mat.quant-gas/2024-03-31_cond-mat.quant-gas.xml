      <title>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the onset of periodic oscillations of coherences in an interacting bosonic gas coupled to a resonator after a quantum quench. This dynamics extends the collapse and revival features of atomic correlations in optical lattices to a dissipative scenario and exhibits hallmarks of synchronization. The behavior emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system, providing a general recipe to engineer intriguing quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the approximate symmetry can arise dynamically during self-organization and can be employed to obtain long-lived coherences.</description>

      <title>Strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamically stable low-temperature phases of the Bose-Fermi mixtures composed of bosons and spinless fermions close to four dimensions are considered. In the regime, where the only boson-fermion two-body interaction is present and tuned to unitary limit, the properties of a system solely depend on the mass and number ratios of constituent atoms. In addition to the phase with the dimers (boson-fermion shallow bound states), we identified one more state of the mixture with the coexistence of fermionic dimers and trimers. The universal physics of these phases, the characteristic feature of is absence of the Bose-Einstein condensate, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing polaron clouds by Rydberg atom spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Rydberg excitations in atomic quantum gases have become a successful platform to explore quantum impurity problems. A single impurity immersed in a Fermi gas leads to the formation of a polaron, a quasiparticle consisting of the impurity being dressed by the surrounding medium. With a radius of about the Fermi wavelength, the density profile of a polaron cannot be explored using in-situ optical imaging techniques. In this work, we propose a new experimental measurement technique that enables the in-situ imaging of the polaron cloud in ultracold quantum gases. The impurity atom is first excited to an interacting state which induces the formation of a polaron cloud. This is followed by the excitation of the impurity atom to a Rydberg state. Due to the mesoscopic interaction range of Rydberg excitations, which can be tuned by the principal numbers of the Rydberg state, atoms extracted from the polaron cloud form dimers with the impurity. By performing first principle calculations of the absorption spectrum based on a functional determinant approach, we show how the occupation of the dimer state can be directly observed in spectroscopy experiments and can be mapped onto the density profile of the gas particles, hence providing a direct, real-time, and in-situ measure of the polaron cloud.</description>

      <title>Synthetic tensor gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields have provided physicists with a unique tool to explore a wide range of fundamentally important phenomena. However, most experiments have been focusing on synthetic vector gauge fields. The very rich physics brought by coupling tensor gauge fields to fracton phase of matter remain unexplored in laboratories. Here, we propose schemes to realize synthetic tensor gauge fields that address dipoles instead of single-particles. A lattice tilted by a strong linear potential and a weak quadratic potential yields a rank-2 electric field for a lineon formed by a particle-hole pair. Such a rank-2 electric field leads to a new type of Bloch oscillations, which modulate the quadrupole moment and preserve the dipole moment of the system. In higher dimensions, the interplay between interactions and vector gauge potentials imprints a phase to the ring-exchange interaction and thus generates synthetic tensor gauge fields for planons. Such tensor gauge fields make it possible to realize a dipolar Harper-Hofstadter model in laboratories. The resultant dipolar Chern insulators feature chiral edge currents of dipoles in the absence of net charge currents.</description>

      <title>Terminable Transitions in a Topological Fermionic Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting fermionic ladders are important platforms to study quantum phases of matter, such as different types of Mott insulators. In particular, the D-Mott and S-Mott states hold pre-formed fermion pairs and become paired-fermion liquids upon doping (d-wave and s-wave, respectively). We show that the D-Mott and S-Mott phases are in fact two facets of the same topological phase and that the transition between them is terminable. These results provide a quantum analog of the well-known terminable liquid-to-gas transition. However, the phenomenology we uncover is even richer, as in contrast to the former, the order of the transition can be tuned by the interactions from continuous to first-order. The findings are based on numerical results using the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism for infinite systems, and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finite systems. This is complemented by analytical field-theoretical explanations. In particular, we present an effective theory to explain the change of transition order, which is potentially applicable to a broad range of other systems. The role of symmetries and edge states are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Diatomic molecules of alkali-metal and alkaline-earth-metal atoms: interaction potentials, dipole moments, and polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold diatomic molecules find application in quantum studies ranging from controlled chemistry and precision measurement physics to quantum many-body simulation and potentially quantum computing. Accurate knowledge of molecular properties is required to guide and explain ongoing experiments. Here, in an extensive and comparative study, we theoretically investigate the electronic properties of the ground-state diatomic molecules composed of alkali-metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) and alkaline-earth-metal (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra) atoms. We study 78 hetero- and homonuclear diatomic combinations, including 21 alkali-metal molecules in the $X^1\Sigma^+$ and $a^3\Sigma^+$ electronic states, 36 alkali-metal--alkaline-earth-metal molecules in the $X^2\Sigma^+$ electronic state, and 21 alkaline-earth-metal molecules in the $X^1\Sigma^+$ electronic state. We calculate potential energy curves, permanent electric dipole moments, and polarizabilities using the hierarchy of coupled cluster methods upto CCSDTQ with large Gaussian basis sets and small-core relativistic energy-consistent pseudopotentials. We collect and analyze corresponding spectroscopic constants. We estimate computational uncertainties and compare the present values with previous experimental and theoretical data to establish a new theoretical benchmark. The presented results should be useful for further application of the studied molecules in modern ultracold physics and chemistry experiments.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction for a system of 2D anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons with a statistical phase parameter $\alpha\in(0,2)$ are a kind of quasi-particles that, for topological reasons, only exist in a 1D or 2D world. We consider the dimensional reduction for a 2D system of anyons in a tight wave-guide. More specifically, we study the 2D magnetic-gauge picture model with an imposed anisotropic harmonic potential that traps particles much stronger in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction. We prove that both the eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions are asymptotically decoupled into the loose confining direction and the tight confining direction during this reduction. The limit 1D system for the $x$-direction is given by the impenetrable Tonks-Girardeau Bose gas, which has no dependency on $\alpha$, and no trace left of the long-range interactions of the 2D model.</description>

      <title>Superfluid extension of the self-consistent time-dependent band theory for neutron star matter: Anti-entrainment versus superfluid effects in the slab phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: The inner crust of neutron stars consists of a Coulomb lattice of neutron-rich nuclei, immersed in a sea of superfluid neutrons with background relativistic electron gas. A proper quantum mechanical treatment for such a system under a periodic potential is the band theory of solids. The effect of band structure on the effective mass of dripped neutrons, the so-called \textit{entrainment effect}, is currently in a debatable situation, and it has been highly desired to develop a nuclear band theory taking into account neutron superfluidity in a fully self-consistent manner.
  Purpose: The main purpose of the present work is twofold: 1) to develop a formalism of the time-dependent self-consistent band theory, taking full account of nuclear superfluidity, based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) extended for superfluid systems, and 2) to quantify the effects of band structure and superfluidity on crustal properties, applying the formalism to the slab phase of nuclear matter in the $\beta$ equilibrium.
  Results: Static calculations have been performed for a range of baryon (nucleon) number density ($n_b=0.04-0.07$ fm$^{-3}$) under the $\beta$-equilibrium condition with and without superfluidity, for various inter-slab spacings. From a dynamic response to an external potential, we extract the collective mass of a slab and that of protons immersed in neutron superfluid. From the results, we find that the collective mass of a slab is substantially reduced by 57.5--82.5\% for $n_b=0.04-0.07$ fm$^{-3}$, which corresponds to an enhancement of conduction neutron number density and, thus, to a reduction of the neutron effective mass, which we call the anti-entrainment effect. We discuss novel phenomena associated with superfluidity, quasiparticle resonances in the inner crust, which are absent in normal systems.

      <title>Quantum fluctuating theory for one-dimensional shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in repulsive one-dimensional Bose gases during the free expansion of a density hump. By building coherent Fermi states for interacting Bethe fermions, we define a quantum fluctuating initial state expressed in terms of universal quantities, namely the density and the Luttinger parameter. In the integrable case, this fluctuating state is then evolved by generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) and, differently from non-fluctuating initial states, it develops density ripples on top of the hydrodynamic mean value. Our analysis gives a general theory of quantum ripples and wave breaking in integrable and quasi-integrable one-dimensional liquids and clarifies the role of the interaction strength. In particular, for strongly/intermediately interacting bosons, we find quantum ripples originating from low-energy modes at the Fermi surface interfering when transported by GHD. In the low coupling limit, near the quasicondensate regime, we find instead that density ripples have a semi-classical nature, and their description requires information on the curvature of the Fermi surface.</description>
