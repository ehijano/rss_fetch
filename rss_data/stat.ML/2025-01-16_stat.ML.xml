      <title>A Constant Velocity Latent Dynamics Approach for Accelerating Simulation of Stiff Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving stiff ordinary differential equations (StODEs) requires sophisticated numerical solvers, which are often computationally expensive. In particular, StODE's often cannot be solved with traditional explicit time integration schemes and one must resort to costly implicit methods to compute solutions. On the other hand, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) based methods such as Neural ODE (NODE) poorly handle the timescale separation of various elements of the solutions to StODEs and require expensive implicit solvers for integration at inference time. In this work, we embark on a different path which involves learning a latent dynamics for StODEs, in which one completely avoids numerical integration. To that end, we consider a constant velocity latent dynamical system whose solution is a sequence of straight lines. Given the initial condition and parameters of the ODE, the encoder networks learn the slope (i.e the constant velocity) and the initial condition for the latent dynamics. In other words, the solution of the original dynamics is encoded into a sequence of straight lines which can be decoded back to retrieve the actual solution as and when required. Another key idea in our approach is a nonlinear transformation of time, which allows for the "stretching/squeezing" of time in the latent space, thereby allowing for varying levels of attention to different temporal regions in the solution. Additionally, we provide a simple universal-approximation-type proof showing that our approach can approximate the solution of stiff nonlinear system on a compact set to any degree of accuracy, {\epsilon}. We show that the dimension of the latent dynamical system in our approach is independent of {\epsilon}. Numerical investigation on prototype StODEs suggest that our method outperforms state-of-the art machine learning approaches for handling StODEs.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Optimistically Universal Online Learnability for General Concept Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a full characterization of the concept classes that are optimistically universally online learnable with $\{0, 1\}$ labels. The notion of optimistically universal online learning was defined in [Hanneke, 2021] in order to understand learnability under minimal assumptions. In this paper, following the philosophy behind that work, we investigate two questions, namely, for every concept class: (1) What are the minimal assumptions on the data process admitting online learnability? (2) Is there a learning algorithm which succeeds under every data process satisfying the minimal assumptions? Such an algorithm is said to be optimistically universal for the given concept class. We resolve both of these questions for all concept classes, and moreover, as part of our solution, we design general learning algorithms for each case. Finally, we extend these algorithms and results to the agnostic case, showing an equivalence between the minimal assumptions on the data process for learnability in the agnostic and realizable cases, for every concept class, as well as the equivalence of optimistically universal learnability.</description>

      <title>Causal vs. Anticausal merging of predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the differences arising from merging predictors in the causal and anticausal directions using the same data. In particular we study the asymmetries that arise in a simple model where we merge the predictors using one binary variable as target and two continuous variables as predictors. We use Causal Maximum Entropy (CMAXENT) as inductive bias to merge the predictors, however, we expect similar differences to hold also when we use other merging methods that take into account asymmetries between cause and effect. We show that if we observe all bivariate distributions, the CMAXENT solution reduces to a logistic regression in the causal direction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the anticausal direction. Furthermore, we study how the decision boundaries of these two solutions differ whenever we observe only some of the bivariate distributions implications for Out-Of-Variable (OOV) generalisation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reservoir Computing and Risk Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a way to bound the generalisation errors of several classes of quantum reservoirs using the Rademacher complexity. We give specific, parameter-dependent bounds for two particular quantum reservoir classes. We analyse how the generalisation bounds scale with growing numbers of qubits. Applying our results to classes with polynomial readout functions, we find that the risk bounds converge in the number of training samples. The explicit dependence on the quantum reservoir and readout parameters in our bounds can be used to control the generalisation error to a certain extent. It should be noted that the bounds scale exponentially with the number of qubits $n$. The upper bounds on the Rademacher complexity can be applied to other reservoir classes that fulfill a few hypotheses on the quantum dynamics and the readout function.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Over-parameterization in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces as an Adaptive Feature Model: Generalization and Adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a diagonal adaptive kernel model that dynamically learns kernel eigenvalues and output coefficients simultaneously during training. Unlike fixed-kernel methods tied to the neural tangent kernel theory, the diagonal adaptive kernel model adapts to the structure of the truth function, significantly improving generalization over fixed-kernel methods, especially when the initial kernel is misaligned with the target. Moreover, we show that the adaptivity comes from learning the right eigenvalues during training, showing a feature learning behavior. By extending to deeper parameterization, we further show how extra depth enhances adaptability and generalization. This study combines the insights from feature learning and implicit regularization and provides new perspective into the adaptivity and generalization potential of neural networks beyond the kernel regime.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Interleaving Variational Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conflicting objectives present a considerable challenge in interleaving multi-task learning, necessitating the need for meticulous design and balance to ensure effective learning of a representative latent data space across all tasks without mutual negative impact. Drawing inspiration from the concept of marginal and conditional probability distributions in probability theory, we design a principled and well-founded approach to disentangle the original input into marginal and conditional probability distributions in the latent space of a variational autoencoder. Our proposed model, Deep Disentangled Interleaving Variational Encoding (DeepDIVE) learns disentangled features from the original input to form clusters in the embedding space and unifies these features via the cross-attention mechanism in the fusion stage. We theoretically prove that combining the objectives for reconstruction and forecasting fully captures the lower bound and mathematically derive a loss function for disentanglement using Na\"ive Bayes. Under the assumption that the prior is a mixture of log-concave distributions, we also establish that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the posterior is upper bounded by a function minimized by the minimizer of the cross entropy loss, informing our adoption of radial basis functions (RBF) and cross entropy with interleaving training for DeepDIVE to provide a justified basis for convergence. Experiments on two public datasets show that DeepDIVE disentangles the original input and yields forecast accuracies better than the original VAE and comparable to existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Is magnitude 'generically continuous' for finite metric spaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces which, in the finite setting, can be understood as recording the 'effective number of points' in a space as the scale of the metric varies. Motivated by applications in topological data analysis, this paper investigates the stability of magnitude: its continuity properties with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We show that magnitude is nowhere continuous on the Gromov-Hausdorff space of finite metric spaces. Yet, we find evidence to suggest that it may be 'generically continuous', in the sense that generic Gromov-Hausdorff limits are preserved by magnitude. We make the case that, in fact, 'generic stability' is what matters for applicability.</description>

      <title>Graph Counterfactual Explainable AI via Latent Space Traversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the predictions of a deep neural network is a nontrivial task, yet high-quality explanations for predictions are often a prerequisite for practitioners to trust these models. Counterfactual explanations aim to explain predictions by finding the ''nearest'' in-distribution alternative input whose prediction changes in a pre-specified way. However, it remains an open question how to define this nearest alternative input, whose solution depends on both the domain (e.g. images, graphs, tabular data, etc.) and the specific application considered. For graphs, this problem is complicated i) by their discrete nature, as opposed to the continuous nature of state-of-the-art graph classifiers; and ii) by the node permutation group acting on the graphs. We propose a method to generate counterfactual explanations for any differentiable black-box graph classifier, utilizing a case-specific permutation equivariant graph variational autoencoder. We generate counterfactual explanations in a continuous fashion by traversing the latent space of the autoencoder across the classification boundary of the classifier, allowing for seamless integration of discrete graph structure and continuous graph attributes. We empirically validate the approach on three graph datasets, showing that our model is consistently high-performing and more robust than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Augmentation Invariant Manifold Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used technique and an essential ingredient in the recent advance in self-supervised representation learning. By preserving the similarity between augmented data, the resulting data representation can improve various downstream analyses and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many applications. Despite the empirical effectiveness, most existing methods lack theoretical understanding under a general nonlinear setting. To fill this gap, we develop a statistical framework on a low-dimension product manifold to model the data augmentation transformation. Under this framework, we introduce a new representation learning method called augmentation invariant manifold learning and design a computationally efficient algorithm by reformulating it as a stochastic optimization problem. Compared with existing self-supervised methods, the new method simultaneously exploits the manifold's geometric structure and invariant property of augmented data and has an explicit theoretical guarantee. Our theoretical investigation characterizes the role of data augmentation in the proposed method and reveals why and how the data representation learned from augmented data can improve the $k$-nearest neighbor classifier in the downstream analysis, showing that a more complex data augmentation leads to more improvement in downstream analysis. Finally, numerical experiments on simulated and real data sets are presented to demonstrate the merit of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first useful and rigorous analysis of ensemble sampling for the stochastic linear bandit setting. In particular, we show that, under standard assumptions, for a $d$-dimensional stochastic linear bandit with an interaction horizon $T$, ensemble sampling with an ensemble of size of order $d \log T$ incurs regret at most of the order $(d \log T)^{5/2} \sqrt{T}$. Ours is the first result in any structured setting not to require the size of the ensemble to scale linearly with $T$ -- which defeats the purpose of ensemble sampling -- while obtaining near $\smash{\sqrt{T}}$ order regret. Our result is also the first to allow for infinite action sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile health leverages personalized and contextually tailored interventions optimized through bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms. In practice, however, challenges such as participant heterogeneity, nonstationarity, and nonlinear relationships hinder algorithm performance. We propose RoME, a Robust Mixed-Effects contextual bandit algorithm that simultaneously addresses these challenges via (1) modeling the differential reward with user- and time-specific random effects, (2) network cohesion penalties, and (3) debiased machine learning for flexible estimation of baseline rewards. We establish a high-probability regret bound that depends solely on the dimension of the differential-reward model, enabling us to achieve robust regret bounds even when the baseline reward is highly complex. We demonstrate the superior performance of the RoME algorithm in a simulation and two off-policy evaluation studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) enriches the expressiveness of variational families by utilizing a kernel and a mixing distribution to hierarchically define the variational distribution. Existing SIVI methods parameterize the mixing distribution using implicit distributions, leading to intractable variational densities. As a result, directly maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is not possible, so they resort to one of the following: optimizing bounds on the ELBO, employing costly inner-loop Markov chain Monte Carlo runs, or solving minimax objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel method for SIVI called Particle Variational Inference (PVI) which employs empirical measures to approximate the optimal mixing distributions characterized as the minimizer of a free energy functional. PVI arises naturally as a particle approximation of a Euclidean--Wasserstein gradient flow and, unlike prior works, it directly optimizes the ELBO whilst making no parametric assumption about the mixing distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that PVI performs favourably compared to other SIVI methods across various tasks. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the gradient flow of a related free energy functional: establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as propagation of chaos results.</description>

      <title>A Unified Confidence Sequence for Generalized Linear Models, with Applications to Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified likelihood ratio-based confidence sequence (CS) for any (self-concordant) generalized linear model (GLM) that is guaranteed to be convex and numerically tight. We show that this is on par or improves upon known CSs for various GLMs, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Poisson. In particular, for the first time, our CS for Bernoulli has a $\mathrm{poly}(S)$-free radius where $S$ is the norm of the unknown parameter. Our first technical novelty is its derivation, which utilizes a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, despite the latter being a rather unpopular choice for deriving CSs. As a direct application of our new CS, we propose a simple and natural optimistic algorithm called OFUGLB, applicable to any generalized linear bandits (GLB; Filippi et al. (2010)). Our analysis shows that the celebrated optimistic approach simultaneously attains state-of-the-art regrets for various self-concordant (not necessarily bounded) GLBs, and even $\mathrm{poly}(S)$-free for bounded GLBs, including logistic bandits. The regret analysis, our second technical novelty, follows from combining our new CS with a new proof technique that completely avoids the previously widely used self-concordant control lemma (Faury et al., 2020, Lemma 9). Numerically, OFUGLB outperforms or is at par with prior algorithms for logistic bandits.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have been marked with the fast-pace diversification and increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications. Yet, a firm theoretical understanding of the surprising efficiency of neural networks to learn from high-dimensional data still proves largely elusive. In this endeavour, analyses inspired by statistical physics have proven instrumental, enabling the tight asymptotic characterization of the learning of neural networks in high dimensions, for a broad class of solvable models. This manuscript reviews the tools and ideas underlying recent progress in this line of work. We introduce a generic model -- the sequence multi-index model -- which encompasses numerous previously studied models as special instances. This unified framework covers a broad class of machine learning architectures with a finite number of hidden units, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, attention mechanisms; and tasks, including (un)supervised learning, denoising, contrastive learning, in the limit of large data dimension, and comparably large number of samples. We explicate in full detail the analysis of the learning of sequence multi-index models, using statistical physics techniques such as the replica method and approximate message-passing algorithms. This manuscript thus provides a unified presentation of analyses reported in several previous works, and a detailed overview of central techniques in the field of statistical physics of machine learning. This review should be a useful primer for machine learning theoreticians curious of statistical physics approaches; it should also be of value to statistical physicists interested in the transfer of such ideas to the study of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Constructing Confidence Intervals for 'the' Generalization Error -- a Comprehensive Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When assessing the quality of prediction models in machine learning, confidence intervals (CIs) for the generalization error, which measures predictive performance, are a crucial tool. Luckily, there exist many methods for computing such CIs and new promising approaches are continuously being proposed. Typically, these methods combine various resampling procedures, most popular among them cross-validation and bootstrapping, with different variance estimation techniques. Unfortunately, however, there is currently no consensus on when any of these combinations may be most reliably employed and how they generally compare. In this work, we conduct a large-scale study comparing CIs for the generalization error, the first one of such size, where we empirically evaluate 13 different CI methods on a total of 19 tabular regression and classification problems, using seven different inducers and a total of eight loss functions. We give an overview of the methodological foundations and inherent challenges of constructing CIs for the generalization error and provide a concise review of all 13 methods in a unified framework. Finally, the CI methods are evaluated in terms of their relative coverage frequency, width, and runtime. Based on these findings, we can identify a subset of methods that we would recommend. We also publish the datasets as a benchmarking suite on OpenML and our code on GitHub to serve as a basis for further studies.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Deep Neural Networks with Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNN estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Synthetic Data Generated by Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While synthetic data hold great promise for privacy protection, their statistical analysis poses significant challenges that necessitate innovative solutions. The use of deep generative models (DGMs) for synthetic data generation is known to induce considerable bias and imprecision into synthetic data analyses, compromising their inferential utility as opposed to original data analyses. This bias and uncertainty can be substantial enough to impede statistical convergence rates, even in seemingly straightforward analyses like mean calculation. The standard errors of such estimators then exhibit slower shrinkage with sample size than the typical 1 over root-$n$ rate. This complicates fundamental calculations like p-values and confidence intervals, with no straightforward remedy currently available. In response to these challenges, we propose a new strategy that targets synthetic data created by DGMs for specific data analyses. Drawing insights from debiased and targeted machine learning, our approach accounts for biases, enhances convergence rates, and facilitates the calculation of estimators with easily approximated large sample variances. We exemplify our proposal through a simulation study on toy data and two case studies on real-world data, highlighting the importance of tailoring DGMs for targeted data analysis. This debiasing strategy contributes to advancing the reliability and applicability of synthetic data in statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Bounds for Adaptive Inverse Reinforcement Learning using Passive Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a finite-sample analysis of a passive stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (PSGLD) algorithm. This algorithm is designed to achieve adaptive inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adaptive IRL aims to estimate the cost function of a forward learner performing a stochastic gradient algorithm (e.g., policy gradient reinforcement learning) by observing their estimates in real-time. The PSGLD algorithm is considered passive because it incorporates noisy gradients provided by an external stochastic gradient algorithm (forward learner), of which it has no control. The PSGLD algorithm acts as a randomized sampler to achieve adaptive IRL by reconstructing the forward learner's cost function nonparametrically from the stationary measure of a Langevin diffusion. This paper analyzes the non-asymptotic (finite-sample) performance; we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein distance between PSGLD algorithm sample measure and the stationary measure encoding the cost function, and provide guarantees for a kernel density estimation scheme which reconstructs the cost function from empirical samples. Our analysis uses tools from the study of Markov diffusion operators. The derived bounds have both practical and theoretical significance. They provide finite-time guarantees for an adaptive IRL mechanism, and substantially generalize the analytical framework of a line of research in passive stochastic gradient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Metric Space Magnitude for Evaluating the Diversity of Latent Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnitude of a metric space is a novel invariant that provides a measure of the 'effective size' of a space across multiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, such as curvature, density, or entropy. We develop a family of magnitude-based measures of the intrinsic diversity of latent representations, formalising a novel notion of dissimilarity between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces. Our measures are provably stable under perturbations of the data, can be efficiently calculated, and enable a rigorous multi-scale characterisation and comparison of latent representations. We show their utility and superior performance across different domains and tasks, including (i) the automated estimation of diversity, (ii) the detection of mode collapse, and (iii) the evaluation of generative models for text, image, and graph data.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Equivariant Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent representations are used extensively for downstream tasks, such as visualization, interpolation or feature extraction of deep learning models. Invariant and equivariant neural networks are powerful and well-established models for enforcing inductive biases. In this paper, we demonstrate that the inductive bias imposed on the by an equivariant model must also be taken into account when using latent representations. We show how not accounting for the inductive biases leads to decreased performance on downstream tasks, and vice versa, how accounting for inductive biases can be done effectively by using an invariant projection of the latent representations. We propose principles for how to choose such a projection, and show the impact of using these principles in two common examples: First, we study a permutation equivariant variational auto-encoder trained for molecule graph generation; here we show that invariant projections can be designed that incur no loss of information in the resulting invariant representation. Next, we study a rotation-equivariant representation used for image classification. Here, we illustrate how random invariant projections can be used to obtain an invariant representation with a high degree of retained information. In both cases, the analysis of invariant latent representations proves superior to their equivariant counterparts. Finally, we illustrate that the phenomena documented here for equivariant neural networks have counterparts in standard neural networks where invariance is encouraged via augmentation. Thus, while these ambiguities may be known by experienced developers of equivariant models, we make both the knowledge as well as effective tools to handle the ambiguities available to the broader community.</description>

      <title>Learning Discrete Concepts in Latent Hierarchical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning concepts from natural high-dimensional data (e.g., images) holds potential in building human-aligned and interpretable machine learning models. Despite its encouraging prospect, formalization and theoretical insights into this crucial task are still lacking. In this work, we formalize concepts as discrete latent causal variables that are related via a hierarchical causal model that encodes different abstraction levels of concepts embedded in high-dimensional data (e.g., a dog breed and its eye shapes in natural images). We formulate conditions to facilitate the identification of the proposed causal model, which reveals when learning such concepts from unsupervised data is possible. Our conditions permit complex causal hierarchical structures beyond latent trees and multi-level directed acyclic graphs in prior work and can handle high-dimensional, continuous observed variables, which is well-suited for unstructured data modalities such as images. We substantiate our theoretical claims with synthetic data experiments. Further, we discuss our theory's implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of latent diffusion models and provide corresponding empirical evidence for our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>MambaLRP: Explaining Selective State Space Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent sequence modeling approaches using selective state space sequence models, referred to as Mamba models, have seen a surge of interest. These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.</description>

      <title>UIFV: Data Reconstruction Attack in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) facilitates collaborative machine learning without the need for participants to share raw private data. However, recent studies have revealed privacy risks where adversaries might reconstruct sensitive features through data leakage during the learning process. Although data reconstruction methods based on gradient or model information are somewhat effective, they reveal limitations in VFL application scenarios. This is because these traditional methods heavily rely on specific model structures and/or have strict limitations on application scenarios. To address this, our study introduces the Unified InverNet Framework into VFL, which yields a novel and flexible approach (dubbed UIFV) that leverages intermediate feature data to reconstruct original data, instead of relying on gradients or model details. The intermediate feature data is the feature exchanged by different participants during the inference phase of VFL. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques in attack precision. Our work exposes severe privacy vulnerabilities within VFL systems that pose real threats to practical VFL applications and thus confirms the necessity of further enhancing privacy protection in the VFL architecture.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic low-rank recurrent neural networks from neural data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.</description>

      <title>Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).</description>

      <title>The Conformer Encoder May Reverse the Time Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We sometimes observe monotonically decreasing cross-attention weights in our Conformer-based global attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models, Further investigation shows that the Conformer encoder reverses the sequence in the time dimension. We analyze the initial behavior of the decoder cross-attention mechanism and find that it encourages the Conformer encoder self-attention to build a connection between the initial frames and all other informative frames. Furthermore, we show that, at some point in training, the self-attention module of the Conformer starts dominating the output over the preceding feed-forward module, which then only allows the reversed information to pass through. We propose methods and ideas of how this flipping can be avoided and investigate a novel method to obtain label-frame-position alignments by using the gradients of the label log probabilities w.r.t. the encoder input frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kernel thinning algorithm of Dwivedi &amp; Mackey (2024) provides a better-than-i.i.d. compression of a generic set of points. By generating high-fidelity coresets of size significantly smaller than the input points, KT is known to speed up unsupervised tasks like Monte Carlo integration, uncertainty quantification, and non-parametric hypothesis testing, with minimal loss in statistical accuracy. In this work, we generalize the KT algorithm to speed up supervised learning problems involving kernel methods. Specifically, we combine two classical algorithms--Nadaraya-Watson (NW) regression or kernel smoothing, and kernel ridge regression (KRR)--with KT to provide a quadratic speed-up in both training and inference times. We show how distribution compression with KT in each setting reduces to constructing an appropriate kernel, and introduce the Kernel-Thinned NW and Kernel-Thinned KRR estimators. We prove that KT-based regression estimators enjoy significantly superior computational efficiency over the full-data estimators and improved statistical efficiency over i.i.d. subsampling of the training data. En route, we also provide a novel multiplicative error guarantee for compressing with KT. We validate our design choices with both simulations and real data experiments.</description>

      <title>Applying the maximum entropy principle to neural networks enhances multi-species distribution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of citizen science initiatives has led to a significant growth of biodiversity databases, and particularly presence-only (PO) observations. PO data are invaluable for understanding species distributions and their dynamics, but their use in a Species Distribution Model (SDM) is curtailed by sampling biases and the lack of information on absences. Poisson point processes are widely used for SDMs, with Maxent being one of the most popular methods. Maxent maximises the entropy of a probability distribution across sites as a function of predefined transformations of variables, called features. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning have emerged as a promising technique for automatic feature extraction from complex input variables. Arbitrarily complex transformations of input variables can be learned from the data efficiently through backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this paper, we propose DeepMaxent, which harnesses neural networks to automatically learn shared features among species, using the maximum entropy principle. To do so, it employs a normalised Poisson loss where for each species, presence probabilities across sites are modelled by a neural network. We evaluate DeepMaxent on a benchmark dataset known for its spatial sampling biases, using PO data for calibration and presence-absence (PA) data for validation across six regions with different biological groups and covariates. Our results indicate that DeepMaxent performs better than Maxent and other leading SDMs across all regions and taxonomic groups. The method performs particularly well in regions of uneven sampling, demonstrating substantial potential to increase SDM performances. In particular, our approach yields more accurate predictions than traditional single-species models, which opens up new possibilities for methodological enhancement.</description>
