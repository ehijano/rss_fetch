      <title>Langevin Monte Carlo Beyond Lipschitz Gradient Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a significant advancement in the field of Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) methods by introducing the Inexact Proximal Langevin Algorithm (IPLA). This novel algorithm broadens the scope of problems that LMC can effectively address while maintaining controlled computational costs. IPLA extends LMC's applicability to potentials that are convex, strongly convex in the tails, and exhibit polynomial growth, beyond the conventional $L$-smoothness assumption. Moreover, we extend LMC's applicability to super-quadratic potentials and offer improved convergence rates over existing algorithms. Additionally, we provide bounds on all moments of the Markov chain generated by IPLA, enhancing its analytical robustness.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Balancing, Filtering, and Complexity on Predictive Multiplicity: A Data-Centric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rashomon effect presents a significant challenge in model selection. It occurs when multiple models achieve similar performance on a dataset but produce different predictions, resulting in predictive multiplicity. This is especially problematic in high-stakes environments, where arbitrary model outcomes can have serious consequences. Traditional model selection methods prioritize accuracy and fail to address this issue. Factors such as class imbalance and irrelevant variables further complicate the situation, making it harder for models to provide trustworthy predictions. Data-centric AI approaches can mitigate these problems by prioritizing data optimization, particularly through preprocessing techniques. However, recent studies suggest preprocessing methods may inadvertently inflate predictive multiplicity. This paper investigates how data preprocessing techniques like balancing and filtering methods impact predictive multiplicity and model stability, considering the complexity of the data. We conduct the experiments on 21 real-world datasets, applying various balancing and filtering techniques, and assess the level of predictive multiplicity introduced by these methods by leveraging the Rashomon effect. Additionally, we examine how filtering techniques reduce redundancy and enhance model generalization. The findings provide insights into the relationship between balancing methods, data complexity, and predictive multiplicity, demonstrating how data-centric AI strategies can improve model performance.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Analysis for Supervised Deep Learning with Exponential Families for Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have revealed that the rate of convergence of the expected test error in deep supervised learning decays as a function of the intrinsic dimension and not the dimension $d$ of the input space. Existing literature defines this intrinsic dimension as the Minkowski dimension or the manifold dimension of the support of the underlying probability measures, which often results in sub-optimal rates and unrealistic assumptions. In this paper, we consider supervised deep learning when the response given the explanatory variable is distributed according to an exponential family with a $\beta$-H\"older smooth mean function. We consider an entropic notion of the intrinsic data-dimension and demonstrate that with $n$ independent and identically distributed samples, the test error scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(n^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)}}\right)$, where $\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$ is the $2\beta$-entropic dimension of $\lambda$, the distribution of the explanatory variables. This improves on the best-known rates. Furthermore, under the assumption of an upper-bounded density of the explanatory variables, we characterize the rate of convergence as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( d^{\frac{2\lfloor\beta\rfloor(\beta + d)}{2\beta + d}}n^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + d}}\right)$, establishing that the dependence on $d$ is not exponential but at most polynomial. We also demonstrate that when the explanatory variable has a lower bounded density, this rate in terms of the number of data samples, is nearly optimal for learning the dependence structure for exponential families.</description>

      <title>Matrix Completion via Residual Spectral Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy matrix completion has attracted significant attention due to its applications in recommendation systems, signal processing and image restoration. Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals.In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</description>

      <title>DQA: An Efficient Method for Deep Quantization of Deep Neural Network Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization of Deep Neural Network (DNN) activations is a commonly used technique to reduce compute and memory demands during DNN inference, which can be particularly beneficial on resource-constrained devices. To achieve high accuracy, existing methods for quantizing activations rely on complex mathematical computations or perform extensive searches for the best hyper-parameters. However, these expensive operations are impractical on devices with limited computation capabilities, memory capacities, and energy budgets. Furthermore, many existing methods do not focus on sub-6-bit (or deep) quantization.
  To fill these gaps, in this paper we propose DQA (Deep Quantization of DNN Activations), a new method that focuses on sub-6-bit quantization of activations and leverages simple shifting-based operations and Huffman coding to be efficient and achieve high accuracy. We evaluate DQA with 3, 4, and 5-bit quantization levels and three different DNN models for two different tasks, image classification and image segmentation, on two different datasets. DQA shows significantly better accuracy (up to 29.28%) compared to the direct quantization method and the state-of-the-art NoisyQuant for sub-6-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>A Quasilinear Algorithm for Computing Higher-Order Derivatives of Deep Feed-Forward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of neural networks for solving differential equations is practically difficult due to the exponentially increasing runtime of autodifferentiation when computing high-order derivatives. We propose $n$-TangentProp, the natural extension of the TangentProp formalism \cite{simard1991tangent} to arbitrarily many derivatives. $n$-TangentProp computes the exact derivative $d^n/dx^n f(x)$ in quasilinear, instead of exponential time, for a densely connected, feed-forward neural network $f$ with a smooth, parameter-free activation function. We validate our algorithm empirically across a range of depths, widths, and number of derivatives. We demonstrate that our method is particularly beneficial in the context of physics-informed neural networks where \ntp allows for significantly faster training times than previous methods and has favorable scaling with respect to both model size and loss-function complexity as measured by the number of required derivatives.

      <title>Learning Structural Causal Models from Ordering: Identifiable Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address causal inference when only observational data and a valid causal ordering from the causal graph are available. We introduce a set of flow models that can recover component-wise, invertible transformation of exogenous variables. Our flow-based methods offer flexible model design while maintaining causal consistency regardless of the number of discretization steps. We propose design improvements that enable simultaneous learning of all causal mechanisms and reduce abduction and prediction complexity to linear O(n) relative to the number of layers, independent of the number of causal variables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches and delivers consistent performance across a wide range of structural causal models in answering observational, interventional, and counterfactual questions. Additionally, our method achieves a significant reduction in computational time compared to existing diffusion-based techniques, making it practical for large structural causal models.</description>

      <title>Assessing high-order effects in feature importance via predictability decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the large body of work devoted in recent years to describe redundancy and synergy in multivariate interactions among random variables, we propose a novel approach to quantify cooperative effects in feature importance, one of the most used techniques for explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, we propose an adaptive version of a well-known metric of feature importance, named Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO), to disentangle high-order effects involving a given input feature in regression problems. LOCO is the reduction of the prediction error when the feature under consideration is added to the set of all the features used for regression. Instead of calculating the LOCO using all the features at hand, as in its standard version, our method searches for the multiplet of features that maximize LOCO and for the one that minimize it. This provides a decomposition of the LOCO as the sum of a two-body component and higher-order components (redundant and synergistic), also highlighting the features that contribute to building these high-order effects alongside the driving feature. We report the application to proton/pion discrimination from simulated detector measures by GEANT.</description>

      <title>Class flipping for uplift modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effect estimation on imbalanced RCT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplift modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) estimation aim at predicting the causal effect of an action, such as a medical treatment or a marketing campaign on a specific individual. In this paper, we focus on data from Randomized Controlled Experiments which guarantee causal interpretation of the outcomes. Class and treatment imbalance are important problems in uplift modeling/HTE, but classical undersampling or oversampling based approaches are hard to apply in this case since they distort the predicted effect. Calibration methods have been proposed in the past, however, they do not guarantee correct predictions. In this work, we propose an approach alternative to undersampling, based on flipping the class value of selected records. We show that the proposed approach does not distort the predicted effect and does not require calibration. The method is especially useful for models based on class variable transformation (modified outcome models). We address those models separately, designing a transformation scheme which guarantees correct predictions and addresses also the problem of treatment imbalance which is especially important for those models. Experiments fully confirm our theoretical results. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is a viable alternative also for standard classification problems.</description>

      <title>Are you doing better than random guessing? A call for using negative controls when evaluating causal discovery algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New proposals for causal discovery algorithms are typically evaluated using simulations and a few select real data examples with known data generating mechanisms. However, there does not exist a general guideline for how such evaluation studies should be designed, and therefore, comparing results across different studies can be difficult. In this article, we propose a common evaluation baseline by posing the question: Are we doing better than random guessing? For the task of graph skeleton estimation, we derive exact distributional results under random guessing for the expected behavior of a range of typical causal discovery evaluation metrics (including precision and recall). We show that these metrics can achieve very large values under random guessing in certain scenarios, and hence warn against using them without also reporting negative control results, i.e., performance under random guessing. We also propose an exact test of overall skeleton fit, and showcase its use on a real data application. Finally, we propose a general pipeline for using random controls beyond the skeleton estimation task, and apply it both in a simulated example and a real data application.</description>

      <title>AMUSE: Adaptive Model Updating using a Simulated Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction models frequently face the challenge of concept drift, in which the underlying data distribution changes over time, weakening performance. Examples can include models which predict loan default, or those used in healthcare contexts. Typical management strategies involve regular model updates or updates triggered by concept drift detection. However, these simple policies do not necessarily balance the cost of model updating with improved classifier performance. We present AMUSE (Adaptive Model Updating using a Simulated Environment), a novel method leveraging reinforcement learning trained within a simulated data generating environment, to determine update timings for classifiers. The optimal updating policy depends on the current data generating process and ongoing drift process. Our key idea is that we can train an arbitrarily complex model updating policy by creating a training environment in which possible episodes of drift are simulated by a parametric model, which represents expectations of possible drift patterns. As a result, AMUSE proactively recommends updates based on estimated performance improvements, learning a policy that balances maintaining model performance with minimizing update costs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of AMUSE in simulated data.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Statistics Applications to Batch Effects in Metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch effects are inevitable in large-scale metabolomics. Prior to formal data analysis, batch effect correction (BEC) is applied to prevent from obscuring biological variations, and batch effect evaluation (BEE) is used for correction assessment. However, existing BEE algorithms neglect covariances between the variables, and existing BEC algorithms might fail to adequately correct the covariances. Therefore, we resort to recent advancements in high-dimensional statistics, and respectively propose "quality control-based simultaneous tests (QC-ST)" and "covariance correction (CoCo)". Validated by the simulation data, QC-ST can simultaneously detect the statistical significance of QC samples' mean vectors and covariance matrices across different batches, and has a satisfactory statistical performance in empirical sizes, empirical powers, and computational speed. Then, we apply four QC-based BEC algorithms to two large cohort datasets, and find that extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) performs best in relative standard deviation (RSD) and dispersion-ratio (D-ratio). After prepositive BEC, if QC-ST still suggests that batch effects between some two batches are significant, CoCo should be implemented. And after CoCo (if necessary), the four metrics (i.e., RSD, D-ratio, classification performance, and QC-ST) might be further improved. In summary, under the guidance of QC-ST, we can develop a matching strategy to integrate multiple BEC algorithms more rationally and flexibly, and minimize batch effects for reliable biological conclusions.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of predictive AI models to support medical decisions: Overview and guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A myriad of measures to illustrate performance of predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models have been proposed in the literature. Selecting appropriate performance measures is essential for predictive AI models that are developed to be used in medical practice, because poorly performing models may harm patients and lead to increased costs. We aim to assess the merits of classic and contemporary performance measures when validating predictive AI models for use in medical practice. We focus on models with a binary outcome. We discuss 32 performance measures covering five performance domains (discrimination, calibration, overall, classification, and clinical utility) along with accompanying graphical assessments. The first four domains cover statistical performance, the fifth domain covers decision-analytic performance. We explain why two key characteristics are important when selecting which performance measures to assess: (1) whether the measure's expected value is optimized when it is calculated using the correct probabilities (i.e., a "proper" measure), and (2) whether they reflect either purely statistical performance or decision-analytic performance by properly considering misclassification costs. Seventeen measures exhibit both characteristics, fourteen measures exhibited one characteristic, and one measure possessed neither characteristic (the F1 measure). All classification measures (such as classification accuracy and F1) are improper for clinically relevant decision thresholds other than 0.5 or the prevalence. We recommend the following measures and plots as essential to report: AUROC, calibration plot, a clinical utility measure such as net benefit with decision curve analysis, and a plot with probability distributions per outcome category.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multitask Linear Regression and Contextual Bandits under Sparse Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large and complex datasets are often collected from several, possibly heterogeneous sources. Multitask learning methods improve efficiency by leveraging commonalities across datasets while accounting for possible differences among them. Here, we study multitask linear regression and contextual bandits under sparse heterogeneity, where the source/task-associated parameters are equal to a global parameter plus a sparse task-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage estimator called MOLAR that leverages this structure by first constructing a covariate-wise weighted median of the task-wise linear regression estimates and then shrinking the task-wise estimates towards the weighted median. Compared to task-wise least squares estimates, MOLAR improves the dependence of the estimation error on the data dimension. Extensions of MOLAR to generalized linear models and constructing confidence intervals are discussed in the paper. We then apply MOLAR to develop methods for sparsely heterogeneous multitask contextual bandits, obtaining improved regret guarantees over single-task bandit methods. We further show that our methods are minimax optimal by providing a number of lower bounds. Finally, we support the efficiency of our methods by performing experiments on both synthetic data and the PISA dataset on student educational outcomes from heterogeneous countries.</description>

      <title>Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in ProbDR, that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate for the precision/inverse covariance) matrix using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, by showing that variances corresponding to these covariances are low (and misspecified), and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied, and pose two areas of research arising from these interpretations.</description>

      <title>Using Low-Discrepancy Points for Data Compression in Machine Learning: An Experimental Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-discrepancy points (also called Quasi-Monte Carlo points) are deterministically and cleverly chosen point sets in the unit cube, which provide an approximation of the uniform distribution. We explore two methods based on such low-discrepancy points to reduce large data sets in order to train neural networks. The first one is the method of Dick and Feischl [4], which relies on digital nets and an averaging procedure. Motivated by our experimental findings, we construct a second method, which again uses digital nets, but Voronoi clustering instead of averaging. Both methods are compared to the supercompress approach of [14], which is a variant of the K-means clustering algorithm. The comparison is done in terms of the compression error for different objective functions and the accuracy of the training of a neural network.</description>

      <title>Self-test loss functions for learning weak-form operators and gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of loss functions presents a major challenge in data-driven modeling involving weak-form operators in PDEs and gradient flows, particularly due to the need to select test functions appropriately. We address this challenge by introducing self-test loss functions, which employ test functions that depend on the unknown parameters, specifically for cases where the operator depends linearly on the unknowns. The proposed self-test loss function conserves energy for gradient flows and coincides with the expected log-likelihood ratio for stochastic differential equations. Importantly, it is quadratic, facilitating theoretical analysis of identifiability and well-posedness of the inverse problem, while also leading to efficient parametric or nonparametric regression algorithms. It is computationally simple, requiring only low-order derivatives or even being entirely derivative-free, and numerical experiments demonstrate its robustness against noisy and discrete data.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Scalable Estimation of Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node and graph representation learning tasks, the reliability of GNN uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts remains relatively under-explored. Indeed, while post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution calibration, they need not also improve calibration under distribution shift. However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty estimates are particularly valuable, as they can always be combined with post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty estimates. Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\Delta$UQ on pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate, concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\Delta$UQ leads to better calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\Delta$UQ in obtaining reliable estimates.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Point Approach for Causal Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel formalism for describing Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as fixed-point problems on causally ordered variables, eliminating the need for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and establish the weakest known conditions for their unique recovery given the topological ordering (TO). Based on this, we design a two-stage causal generative model that first infers in a zero-shot manner a valid TO from observations, and then learns the generative SCM on the ordered variables. To infer TOs, we propose to amortize the learning of TOs on synthetically generated datasets by sequentially predicting the leaves of graphs seen during training. To learn SCMs, we design a transformer-based architecture that exploits a new attention mechanism enabling the modeling of causal structures, and show that this parameterization is consistent with our formalism. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of each method individually, and show that when combined, our model outperforms various baselines on generated out-of-distribution problems. The code is available on \href{https://github.com/microsoft/causica/tree/main/research_experiments/fip}{Github}.</description>

      <title>$\nabla^2$DFT: A Universal Quantum Chemistry Dataset of Drug-Like Molecules and a Benchmark for Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</description>

      <title>Minimum Reduced-Order Models via Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing sparse, effective reduced-order models (ROMs) for high-dimensional dynamical data is an active area of research in applied sciences. In this work, we study an efficient approach to identifying such sparse ROMs using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. Given a feature library of possible building block terms for the sought ROMs, the causation entropy ranks the importance of each term to the dynamics conveyed by the training data before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. It thus allows for an efficient construction of a hierarchy of ROMs with varying degrees of sparsity to effectively handle different tasks. This article examines the ability of the causation entropy to identify skillful sparse ROMs when a relatively high-dimensional ROM is required to emulate the dynamics conveyed by the training dataset. We demonstrate that a Gaussian approximation of the causation entropy still performs exceptionally well even in presence of highly non-Gaussian statistics. Such approximations provide an efficient way to access the otherwise hard to compute causation entropies when the selected feature library contains a large number of candidate functions. Besides recovering long-term statistics, we also demonstrate good performance of the obtained ROMs in recovering unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations, a test that has not been done before for causation-based ROMs of partial differential equations. The paradigmatic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation placed in a chaotic regime with highly skewed, multimodal statistics is utilized for these purposes.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Information Bottleneck Method for Clustering Mixed-Type Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The proposed approach is built on the deterministic variant of the Information Bottleneck algorithm, designed to optimally compress data while preserving its relevant structural information. We evaluate the performance of our method against four well-established clustering techniques for mixed-type data -- KAMILA, K-Prototypes, Factor Analysis for Mixed Data with K-Means, and Partitioning Around Medoids using Gower's dissimilarity -- using both simulated and real-world datasets. The results highlight that the proposed approach offers a competitive alternative to traditional clustering techniques, particularly under specific conditions where heterogeneity in data poses significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Bayesian sequential deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density deconvolution deals with the estimation of the probability density function $f$ of a random signal from $n\geq1$ data observed with independent and known additive random noise. This is a classical problem in statistics, for which frequentist and Bayesian nonparametric approaches are available to estimate $f$ in static or batch domains. In this paper, we consider the problem of density deconvolution in a streaming or online domain, and develop a principled sequential approach to estimate $f$. By relying on a quasi-Bayesian sequential (learning) model for the data, often referred to as Newton's algorithm, we obtain a sequential deconvolution estimate $f_{n}$ of $f$ that is of easy evaluation, computationally efficient, and with constant computational cost as data increase, which is desirable for streaming data. In particular, local and uniform Gaussian central limit theorems for $f_{n}$ are established, leading to asymptotic credible intervals and bands for $f$, respectively. We provide the sequential deconvolution estimate $f_{n}$ with large sample asymptotic guarantees under the quasi-Bayesian sequential model for the data, proving a merging with respect to the direct density estimation problem, and also under a ``true" frequentist model for the data, proving consistency. An empirical validation of our methods is presented on synthetic and real data, also comparing with respect to a kernel approach and a Bayesian nonparametric approach with a Dirichlet process mixture prior.</description>

      <title>Exact gradients for linear optics with single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though parameter shift rules have drastically improved gradient estimation methods for several types of quantum circuits, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks, so far they have not been transferable to linear optics with single photons. In this work, we derive an analytical formula for the gradients in these circuits with respect to phaseshifters via a generalized parameter shift rule, where the number of parameter shifts depends linearly on the total number of photons. Experimentally, this enables access to derivatives in photonic systems without the need for finite difference approximations. Building on this, we propose two strategies through which one can reduce the number of shifts in the expression, and hence reduce the overall sample complexity. Numerically, we show that this generalized parameter-shift rule can converge to the minimum of a cost function with fewer parameter update steps than alternative techniques. We anticipate that this method will open up new avenues to solving optimization problems with photonic systems, as well as provide new techniques for the experimental characterization and control of linear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Trained Transformer Classifiers Generalize and Exhibit Benign Overfitting In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have the capacity to act as supervised learning algorithms: by properly encoding a set of labeled training ("in-context") examples and an unlabeled test example into an input sequence of vectors of the same dimension, the forward pass of the transformer can produce predictions for that unlabeled test example. A line of recent work has shown that when linear transformers are pre-trained on random instances for linear regression tasks, these trained transformers make predictions using an algorithm similar to that of ordinary least squares. In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks. Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time. We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit "benign overfitting in-context": when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples.</description>

      <title>Score and Distribution Matching Policy: Advanced Accelerated Visuomotor Policies via Matched Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.</description>
