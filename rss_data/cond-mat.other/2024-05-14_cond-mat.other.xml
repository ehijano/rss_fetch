      <title>A logical qubit-design with geometrically tunable error-resistibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking the error-threshold would mark a milestone in establishing quantum advantage for a wide range of relevant problems. One possible route is to encode information redundantly in a logical qubit by combining several noisy qubits, providing an increased robustness against external perturbations. We propose a setup for a logical qubit built from superconducting qubits (SCQs) coupled to a microwave cavity-mode. Our design is based on a recently discovered geometric stabilizing mechanism in the Bose-Hubbard wheel (BHW), which manifests as energetically well-separated clusters of many-body eigenstates. We investigate the impact of experimentally relevant perturbations between SCQs and the cavity on the spectral properties of the BHW. We show that even in the presence of typical fabrication uncertainties, the occurrence and separation of clustered many-body eigenstates is extremely robust. Introducing an additional, frequency-detuned SCQ coupled to the cavity yields duplicates of these clusters, that can be split up by an on-site potential. We show that this allows to (i) redundantly encode two logical qubit states that can be switched and read out efficiently and (ii) can be separated from the remaining many-body spectrum via geometric stabilization. We demonstrate at the example of an X-gate that the proposed logical qubit reaches single qubit-gate fidelities $&gt;0.999$ in experimentally feasible temperature regimes $\sim10-20\,\mathrm{mK}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the quasi-XY Shastry-Sutherland magnet Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycrystalline and single crystal samples of the insulating Shastry-Sutherland compound Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ were synthesized via a solid-state reaction and the floating zone method respectively. The crystal structure, Er single ion anisotropy, zero-field magnetic ground state, and magnetic phase diagrams along high-symmetry crystallographic directions were investigated by bulk measurement techniques, x-ray and neutron diffraction, and neutron spectroscopy. We establish that Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ crystallizes in a tetragonal space group with planes of orthogonal Er dimers and a strong preference for the Er moments to lie in the local plane perpendicular to each dimer bond. We also find that this system has a non-collinear ordered ground state in zero field with a transition temperature of 0.841 K consisting of antiferromagnetic dimers and in-plane moments. Finally, we mapped out the $H-T$ phase diagrams for Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ along the directions $H \parallel$ [001], [100], and [110]. While an increasing in-plane field simply induces a phase transition to a field-polarized phase, we identify three metamagnetic transitions before the field-polarized phase is established in the $H \parallel$ [001] case. This complex behavior establishes insulating Er$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$ and other isostructural family members as promising candidates for uncovering exotic magnetic properties and phenomena that can be readily compared to theoretical predictions of the exactly soluble Shastry-Sutherland model.</description>
