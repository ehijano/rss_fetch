      <title>A Hierarchical Signal Coordination and Control System Using a Hybrid Model-based and Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC); and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware, GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across all demand levels.</description>

      <title>Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Motion Planning for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models, leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance with racing regulations.</description>

      <title>Neural Spline Operators for Risk Quantification in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements, which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk quantification.</description>

      <title>Systolic Array-based Architecture for Low-Bit Integerized Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models are becoming more and more intelligent and are revolutionizing a wide range of human tasks. To support their deployment, AI labs offer inference services that consume hundreds of GWh of energy annually and charge users based on the number of tokens processed. Under this cost model, minimizing power consumption and maximizing throughput have become key design goals for the inference hardware. While graphics processing units (GPUs) are commonly used, their flexibility comes at the cost of low operational intensity and limited efficiency, especially under the high query-per-model ratios of modern inference services.
  In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a low-bit, model-specialized accelerator that strategically selects tasks with high operation (OP) reuse and minimal communication overhead for offloading. Our design incorporates multiple systolic arrays with deep, fine-grained pipelines and array-compatible units that support essential operations in multi-head self-attention (MSA) module. At the accelerator-level, each self-attention (SA) head is pipelined within a single accelerator to increase data reuse and further minimize bandwidth.
  Our 3-bit integerized model achieves 96.83% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 77.81% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We validate the hardware design on a 16nm FPGA (Alveo U250), where it delivers 13,568 GigaOps/second (GOPs/s) and 219.4 GOPs/s/W. Compared to a same-technology GPU (GTX 1080), our design offers 1.50x higher throughput and 4.47x better power efficiency. Even against a state-of-the-art GPU (RTX 5090), we still achieve 20% better power efficiency despite having 87% lower throughput.</description>

      <title>Delay-adaptive Control of Nonlinear Systems with Approximate Neural Operator Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay. We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times compared to traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Policy Iteration for Stochastic LQ Tracking with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal tracking control problem for continuous-time stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise. The solution framework involves solving a stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for the feedback gain and a Sylvester equation for the feedforward gain. To enable model-free optimal tracking, we first develop a two-phase bootstrap policy iteration (B-PI) algorithm, which bootstraps a stabilizing control gain from the trivially initialized zero-value start and proceeds with standard policy iteration. Building on this algorithm, we propose a data-driven, off-policy reinforcement learning approach that ensures convergence to the optimal feedback gain under the interval excitation condition. We further introduce a data-driven method to compute the feedforward using the obtained feedback gain. Additionally, for systems with state-dependent noise, we propose a shadow system-based optimal tracking method to eliminate the need for probing noise. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>MegaCacheX: Towards Cost-Effective Hierarchical Collaborative Content Caching in Emerging Mega-Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant latency in global content delivery primarily arises from insufficient terrestrial infrastructure. Deploying space-based content delivery networks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to bridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from physical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying inter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition, existing mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global optimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical framework for collaborative content distribution that achieves "Earth-independence" by providing cloud services directly from space. Specifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content sources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations collaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching strategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and satellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service anchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype implemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that MegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to baseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Joint Contact Planning for Navigation and Communication in GNSS-Libration Point Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon Libration Points (LPs) addresses the inherent deep-space coverage gaps of low-altitude GNSS constellations. Integrating LP satellites with GNSS into a joint constellation enables a more robust and comprehensive Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) system, while also extending navigation and communication services to spacecraft operating in cislunar space (i.e., users). However, the long propagation delays between LP satellites, users, and GNSS satellites result in significantly different link durations compared to those within the GNSS constellation. Scheduling inter-satellite links (ISLs) is a core task of Contact Plan Design (CPD). Existing CPD approaches focus exclusively on GNSS constellations, assuming uniform link durations, and thus cannot accommodate the heterogeneous link timescales present in a joint GNSS-LP system. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Joint CPD (J-CPD) scheme tailored to handle ISLs with differing duration units across integrated constellations. The key contributions of J-CPD are: (i):introduction of LongSlots (Earth-Moon scale links) and ShortSlots (GNSS-scale links); (ii):a hierarchical and crossed CPD process for scheduling LongSlots and ShortSlots ISLs; (iii):an energy-driven link scheduling algorithm adapted to the CPD process. Simulations on a joint BeiDou-LP constellation demonstrate that J-CPD surpasses the baseline FCP method in both delay and ranging coverage, while maintaining high user satisfaction and enabling tunable trade-offs through adjustable potential-energy parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first CPD framework to jointly optimize navigation and communication in GNSS-LP systems, representing a key step toward unified and resilient deep-space PNT architectures.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Heterogeneous Platoons with Guaranteed Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a framework for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control of a vehicular platoon characterized by unidirectional communication and heterogeneous parameters. In the proposed framework, the actual (heterogeneous) platoon is made to converge to a reference (homogeneous) platoon via adaptive laws designed using of set-theoretic model reference adaptive control. Yet, in contrast to the state-of-art that is based on ensuring collision avoidance on the reference platoon dynamics only, the approach we propose can ensure collision avoidance on the actual platoon dynamics. This result is possible thanks to the introduction of a novel concept of virtual platoon, only used for analysis, but that does not interact with the actual platoon. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed framework are established using Lyapunov-based analysis in conjunction with the aforementioned virtual platoon concept.</description>

      <title>Local Observability of a Class of Feedforward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the traditional neural network training methods based on gradient descent and its variants, state estimation techniques have been proposed to determine a set of ideal weights from a control-theoretic perspective. Hence, the concept of observability becomes relevant in neural network training. In this paper, we investigate local observability of a class of two-layer feedforward neural networks~(FNNs) with rectified linear unit~(ReLU) activation functions. We analyze local observability of FNNs by evaluating an observability rank condition with respect to the weight matrix and the input sequence. First, we show that, in general, the weights of FNNs are not locally observable. Then, we provide sufficient conditions on the network structures and the weights that lead to local observability. Moreover, we propose an input design approach to render the weights distinguishable and show that this input also excites other weights inside a neighborhood. Finally, we validate our results through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Transient Stability Analysis of a Hybrid Grid-Forming and Grid-Following RES System Considering Multi-Mode Control Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent control switching of renewable energy sources (RESs) during intricate transient processes introduces complexity to the dynamic behavior of modern power systems. This paper reveals the dynamic coupling between grid forming (GFM)/grid following (GFL)-based RES and dominant instability modes of the hybrid system. First, six control combinations are systematically investigated by pairing the two GFM-RES modes, normal control (NC) and current saturation (CS), with the three GFL-RES modes: normal control, low voltage ride-through (LVRT), and high voltage ride-through (HVRT). Based on switching system theory, the coupled power flow and dynamic motion models are developed considering multi-mode switching characteristics. It is revealed that the hybrid system exhibits two distinct instability modes when the GFM-RES and GFL-RES exceed their P-f and V-f desynchronization boundaries, respectively. The two-dimensional spatiotemporal damping characteristics of GFL-RES induced by GFM-RES are also uncovered for the first time. A novel criterion is proposed to quantify the impact of GFM-RES on GFL-RES dynamics, capturing both its stabilizing and destabilizing effects under different control combinations. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations validate the correctness of the analysis framework.</description>

      <title>DMPC-Swarm: Distributed Model Predictive Control on Nano UAV swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming vital to our society, undertaking tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has emerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by combining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion control. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems with coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their solutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC variant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true distributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to the lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of mobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while adhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-SWARM, a new swarm control methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless communication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV collisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and distributed off-board computing, DMPC-SWARM supports nano UAVs, allowing them to benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability and fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that DMPC-SWARM guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including communication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-SWARM's implementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first realization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple physical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks. A video showcasing DMPC-SWARM is available at http://tiny.cc/DMPCSwarm.</description>

      <title>Minimizing AoI in Mobile Edge Computing: Nested Index Policy with Preemptive and Non-preemptive Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) leverages computational heterogeneity between mobile devices and edge nodes to enable real-time applications requiring high information freshness. The Age-of-Information (AoI) metric serves as a crucial evaluator of information timeliness in such systems. Addressing AoI minimization in multi-user MEC environments presents significant challenges due to stochastic computing times. In this paper, we consider multiple users offloading tasks to heterogeneous edge servers in an MEC system, focusing on preemptive and non-preemptive task scheduling mechanisms. The problem is first reformulated as a Restless Multi-Arm Bandit (RMAB) problem, with a multi-layer Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework established to characterize AoI dynamics in the MEC system. Based on the multi-layer MDP, we propose a nested index framework and design a nested index policy with provably asymptotic optimality. This establishes a theoretical framework adaptable to various scheduling mechanisms, achieving efficient optimization through state stratification and index design in both preemptive and non-preemptive modes. Finally, the closed-form of the nested index is derived, facilitating performance trade-offs between computational complexity and accuracy while ensuring the universal applicability of the nested index policy across both scheduling modes. The experimental results show that in non-preemptive scheduling, compared with the benchmark method, the optimality gap is reduced by 25.43%, while in preemptive scheduling, the gap has reduced by 61.84%. As the system scale increases, it asymptotically converges in two scheduling modes and especially provides near-optimal performance in non-preemptive structure.</description>

A \SI{130}{nm}, \SI{1.2}{V} LNA implementing the proposed architecture is designed based on an analysis of variability in traditional LNAs under different bias currents and on the corresponding effects on the performance of a complete receiver. Two different adjustment strategies are evaluated, both of which are compatible with previously reported built-in self-test (BIST) circuits. Results show that the proposed architecture enables yield enhancement while keeping low-power operation compared with traditional LNAs.</description>

      <title>Optimistic vs Pessimistic Uncertainty Model Unfalsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, input-output data-driven approach to uncertainty model identification. As the true bounds and distributions of system uncertainties ultimately remain unknown, we depart from the goal of identifying the uncertainty model and instead look for minimal concrete statements that can be made based on an uncertain system model and available input-output data. We refer to this as unfalsifying an uncertainty model. Two different unfalsification approaches are taken. The optimistic approach determines the smallest uncertainties that could explain the given data, while the pessimistic approach finds the largest possible uncertainties suggested by the data. The pessimistic problem is revealed to be a semi-infinite program, which is solved using the local reduction algorithm. It is also shown that the optimistic and pessimistic approaches to uncertainty model unfalsification are mathematical duals. Finally, both approaches are tested using an uncertain linear model with data from a simulated nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Multi-cluster distributed optimization in open multi-agent systems over directed graphs with acknowledgement messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of distributed optimization over directed networks in open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where agents may dynamically join or leave, causing persistent changes in network topology and problem dimension. These disruptions not only pose significant challenges to maintaining convergence and stability in distributed optimization algorithms, but could also break the network topology into multiple clusters, each one associated with its own set of objective functions. To address this, we propose a novel Open Distributed Optimization Algorithm with Gradient Tracking (OPEN-GT), which employs: (a) a dynamic mechanism for detecting active out-neighbors through acknowledgement messages, and (b) a fully distributed max-consensus procedure to spread information regarding agent departures, in possibly unbalanced directed networks. We show that when all active agents execute OPEN-GT, the optimization process in each formed cluster remains consistent, while the agents converge to their cluster-wide optimal solution if there exists a time after which the network remains unchanged. Finally, we validate our approach in a simulated environment with dynamically changing agent populations, demonstrating its resilience to network variations and its ability to support distributed optimization under OMAS dynamics.</description>

      <title>AERO-LQG: Aerial-Enabled Robust Optimization for LQG-Based Quadrotor Flight Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrotors are indispensable in civilian, industrial, and military domains, undertaking complex, high-precision tasks once reserved for specialized systems. Across all contexts, energy efficiency remains a critical constraint: quadrotors must reconcile the high power demands of agility with the minimal consumption required for extended endurance. Meeting this trade-off calls for mode-specific optimization frameworks that adapt to diverse mission profiles. At their core lie optimal control policies defining error functions whose minimization yields robust, mission-tailored performance. While solutions are straightforward for fixed weight matrices, selecting those weights is a far greater challenge-lacking analytical guidance and thus relying on exhaustive or stochastic search. This interdependence can be framed as a bi-level optimization problem, with the outer loop determining weights a priori. This work introduces an aerial-enabled robust optimization for LQG tuning (AERO-LQG), a framework employing evolutionary strategy to fine-tune LQG weighting parameters. Applied to the linearized hovering mode of quadrotor flight, AERO-LQG achieves performance gains of several tens of percent, underscoring its potential for enabling high-performance, energy-efficient quadrotor control. The project is available at GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a compact, cost-effective phased array antenna system. It is capable of real-time beam-steering for dynamic target-tracking applications. The system employs a 4$\times$4 rectangular microstrip patch array, utilizing advanced beamforming techniques and a Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation algorithm. It achieves $\pm 42^{\circ}$ wide-angle scanning in both azimuth and elevation planes. The design emphasizes a balance between high angular coverage and consistent gain performance.

      <title>Missing Money and Market-Based Adequacy in Deeply Decarbonized Power Systems with Long-Duration Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Tuning of Time Constants in Spiking Neural Networks for Multimodal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising candidates for low-power edge computing in domains such as wearable sensing and time-series analysis. A key neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Safety in Stochastic Difference Inclusions using Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic systems characterized by difference inclusions. Such stochastic differential inclusions are defined by set-valued maps involving the current state and stochastic input. For such systems, we investigate the problem of proving bounds on the worst-case probability of violating safety properties. Our approach uses the well-known concept of barrier functions from the study of stochastic control systems. However, barrier functions are hard to prove in the presence of stochastic inputs and adversarial choices due to the set-valued nature of the dynamics.
  In this paper, we show that under some assumptions on the set-valued map including upper semi-continuity and convexity combined with a concave barrier function vastly simplifies the proof of barrier conditions, allowing us to effectively substitute each random input in terms of its expectation. We prove key results based on the theory of set-valued maps and provide some interesting numerical examples. The ideas proposed here will contribute to the growing interest in problems of robust control and verification of stochastic systems in the presence of uncertain distributions and unmodeled dynamics.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from signals and systems in a transformer? Insights for probabilistic modeling and inference architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay, we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern inference architectures.</description>

      <title>Testing and Fault Tolerance Techniques for Carbon Nanotube-Based FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor (CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO) based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a 6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead. The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively and efficiently.</description>

      <title>Understanding Incremental Learning with Closed-form Solution to Gradient Flow on Overparamerterized Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper, we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix. By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to asymmetric matrix factorization problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Fast, Tool aware Collision Avoidance for Collaborative Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI) in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover, our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient, and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments. We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate its practical use for safe and responsive operation.</description>

Abstract: Physics-constrained machine learning (PCML) combines physical models with data-driven approaches to improve reliability, generalizability, and interpretability. Although PCML has shown significant benefits in diverse scientific and engineering domains, technical and intellectual challenges hinder its applicability in complex chemical engineering applications. Key difficulties include determining the amount and type of physical knowledge to embed, designing effective fusion strategies with ML, scaling models to large datasets and simulators, and quantifying predictive uncertainty. This perspective summarizes recent developments and highlights challenges/opportunities in applying PCML to chemical engineering, emphasizing on closed-loop experimental design, real-time dynamics and control, and handling of multi-scale phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium, while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise, correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.</description>

      <title>Balancing Profit and Traveller Acceptance in Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.</description>

      <title>Non-expert to Expert Motion Translation Using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data, but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF calligraphy robot.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Data-Driven Framework for Linear Quadratic Output Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear quadratic regulator with unmeasurable states and unknown system matrix parameters better aligns with practical scenarios. However, for this problem, balancing the optimality of the resulting controller and the leniency of the algorithm's feasibility conditions remains a non-trivial challenge, as no well-established general method has yet been developed to address this trade-off. To address this gap, this study first develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for state parameterization that equivalently substitutes for unknown states. By analyzing the controllability of consistent systems satisfied by substitute states, this framework quantifies the capability of substitute state data matrices to parameterize unknown closed-loop systems and output feedback controllers, thereby constructing a modified state parameterization form that meets the complete data parameterization condition of Willems' Fundamental Lemma. Leveraging this framework, this study proposes efficient model-free off-policy policy iteration and value iteration algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve for the optimal output feedback controller. Compared with existing studies, particularly for multi-output problems where existing model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may fail, the proposed method removes redundant information in substitute states and the additional full row rank condition on regression matrices, thereby ensuring the solution of optimal output feedback controllers equivalent to optimal state feedback controllers for multi-output systems. Furthermore, this study pioneers a comprehensive and highly scalable theoretical analysis of state parameterization from a data-driven viewpoint, and the proposed algorithms exhibit significant advantages in implementation conditions, data demand, unknown handling, and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>The Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF): A Bounded Possibilistic Framework for Ordinal State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional state estimation methods rely on probabilistic assumptions that often collapse epistemic uncertainty into scalar beliefs, risking overconfidence in sparse or adversarial sensing environments. We introduce the Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF), a novel non-Bayesian filtering framework fully grounded in possibility theory and epistemic humility. ESPF redefines the evolution of belief over state space using compatibility-weighted support updates, surprisalaware pruning, and adaptive dispersion via sparse grid quadrature. Unlike conventional filters, ESPF does not seek a posterior distribution, but rather maintains a structured region of plausibility or non-rejection, updated using ordinal logic rather than integration. For multi-model inference, we employ the Choquet integral to fuse competing hypotheses based on a dynamic epistemic capacity function, generalizing classical winner-take-all strategies. The result is an inference engine capable of dynamically contracting or expanding belief support in direct response to information structure, without requiring prior statistical calibration. This work presents a foundational shift in how inference, evidence, and ignorance are reconciled, supporting robust estimation where priors are unavailable, misleading, or epistemically unjustified.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Guarantees for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Bandits with Nonstationary Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically. Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral change interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving, reduced-order state observer is presented for the unmeasured part of a system's state, where the nonlinear system dynamics exhibit symmetry under the action of a Lie group. Leveraging this symmetry with a moving frame, the observer dynamics are constructed such that they are invariant under the Lie group's action. Sufficient conditions for the observer to be asymptotically stable are developed by studying the stability of an invariant error system. As an illustrative example, the observer is applied to the problem of rigid-body velocity estimation, which demonstrates how exploiting the symmetry of the system can simplify the stabilization of the estimation error dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a recommendation system. By incorporating elements such as collaborative filtering, we provide a precise characterization of how recommendation systems shape interpersonal interactions and influence opinion formation. Moreover, the property of the coevolution of both opinion dynamics and recommendation systems is also shown. Specifically, the convergence of this coevolutionary system is theoretically proved, and the mechanisms behind filter bubble formation are elucidated. Our analysis of the maximum number of opinion clusters shows how recommendation system parameters affect opinion grouping and polarization. Additionally, we incorporate the influence of propagators into our model and propose a reinforcement learning-based solution. The analysis and the propagation solution are demonstrated in simulations using the Yelp data set.</description>

      <title>TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with different performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Time Input-to-State Stability for Singularly Perturbed Systems via Composite Lyapunov Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</description>

      <title>Optimized Contact Plan Design for Reflector and Phased Array Terminals in Cislunar Space Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cislunar space is emerging as a critical domain for human exploration, requiring robust infrastructure to support spatial users-spacecraft with navigation and communication demands. Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon three-body orbits offers an effective solution to construct cislunar space infrastructure (CLSI). However, scheduling satellite links to serve users necessitates an appropriate contact plan design (CPD) scheme. Existing CPD schemes focus solely on inter-satellite link scheduling, overlooking their role in providing services to users. This paper introduces a CPD scheme that considers two classes of satellite transponders: Reflector Links (RL) for high-volume data transfers and Phased Array Links (PL) for fast switching and navigation services. Our approach supports both satellites and spatial users in cislunar space. Simulations validate the scheme, demonstrating effective support for user while meeting satellite ranging and communication requirements. These findings provide essential insights for developing future Cislunar Space Infrastructures.</description>

      <title>A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental in statistics, system identification, and machine learning. When prior knowledge about the system is available, Bayesian analysis provides a natural framework for encoding it through a prior distribution. In practice, such knowledge is often too vague to specify a full prior distribution, motivating the use of default 'uninformative' priors that minimize subjective bias. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is challenging. In this paper, we develop a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior; the method extends naturally to nonlinear state-space models. The resulting samples can be directly used in sampling-based system identification methods and Bayesian experiment design, providing an objective, information-geometric description of parameter uncertainty. Several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus is a well-studied problem in distributed sensing, computation and control, yet deriving useful and easily computable bounds on the rate of convergence to consensus remains a challenge. This paper discusses the use of seminorms for this goal. A previously suggested family of seminorms is revisited, and an error made in their original presentation is corrected, where it was claimed that the a certain seminorm is equal to the well-known coefficient of ergodicity. Next, a wider family of seminorms is introduced, and it is shown that contraction in any of these seminorms guarantees convergence at an exponential rate of infinite products of matrices, generalizing known results on stochastic matrices to the class of matrices whose row sums are all equal one. Finally, it is shown that such seminorms cannot be used to bound the rate of convergence of classes larger than the well-known class of scrambling matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise characteristics or extensive training.To validate the method performance we conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world data.Results demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Decomposed Learning for Quadrotor Geometric Attitude Control with Almost Global Exponential Convergence on SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and interpretable online learning approach called Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L) for disturbance identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. As a module instance of DiD-L, we propose the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM). Specifically, to address underlying underfitting problems, the high-dimensional mapping for online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (slices). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional subtasks addressed by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without the persistent excitation (PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we prove that the state solution of the rotational error dynamics exponentially converges into an arbitrarily small ball within an almost global attraction domain, despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring pre-training for unseen disturbances and specific knowledge of the model. To our knowledge in the quadrotor control field, DiD-L is the first online learning approach that is lightweight enough to run in real-time at 400 Hz on microcontroller units (MCUs) such as STM32, and has been validated through real-world experiments.</description>

Abstract: Polarimetric phased arrays (PPAs) enhance radar target detection and anti-jamming capabilities. However, the dual transmit/receive (T/R) channel requirement leads to high costs and system complexity. To address this, this paper introduces a polarization-coding reconfigurable phased array (PCRPA) and associated pattern synthesis techniques to reduce PPA costs while minimizing performance degradation. Each PCRPA element connects to a single T/R channel and incorporates two-level RF switches for real-time control of polarization states and waveforms. By adjusting element codes and excitation weights, the PCRPA can generate arbitrarily polarized and dual-polarized beams. Efficient beam pattern synthesis methods are also proposed, featuring novel optimization constraints derived from theoretical and analytical analysis of PCRPAs. Simulations demonstrate that the approach achieves low cross-polarization and sidelobe levels comparable to conventional architectures within the scan range, particularly for large arrays. However, the channel reduction inevitably incurs power and directivity loss. Experiments conducted on an $8\times 8$ X-band array antenna validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The PCRPA and synthesis methods are well-suited for large-scale PPA systems, offering significant cost-effectiveness while maintaining good sidelobe suppression and polarization control performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Complex Motion Plans using Neural ODEs with Safety and Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Dynamical System (DS) approach to learn complex, possibly periodic motion plans from kinesthetic demonstrations using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). To ensure reactivity and robustness to disturbances, we propose a novel approach that selects a target point at each time step for the robot to follow, by combining tools from control theory and the target trajectory generated by the learned NODE. A correction term to the NODE model is computed online by solving a quadratic program that guarantees stability and safety using control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions, respectively. Our approach outperforms baseline DS learning techniques on the LASA handwriting dataset and complex periodic trajectories. It is also validated on the Franka Emika robot arm to produce stable motions for wiping and stirring tasks that do not have a single attractor, while being robust to perturbations and safe around humans and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at https://github.com/Cherry0302/Enhanced-TR-SCO.</description>

      <title>Canonical Bayesian Linear System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.</description>

      <title>Residual Neural Terminal Constraint for MPC-based Collision Avoidance in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time. We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF, resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties. The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}</description>

      <title>Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>HPC Digital Twins for Evaluating Scheduling Policies, Incentive Structures and their Impact on Power and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schedulers are critical for optimal resource utilization in high-performance computing. Traditional methods to evaluate schedulers are limited to post-deployment analysis, or simulators, which do not model associated infrastructure. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind integration of scheduling and digital twins in HPC. This enables what-if studies to understand the impact of parameter configurations and scheduling decisions on the physical assets, even before deployment, or regarching changes not easily realizable in production. We (1) provide the first digital twin framework extended with scheduling capabilities, (2) integrate various top-tier HPC systems given their publicly available datasets, (3) implement extensions to integrate external scheduling simulators. Finally, we show how to (4) implement and evaluate incentive structures, as-well-as (5) evaluate machine learning based scheduling, in such novel digital-twin based meta-framework to prototype scheduling. Our work enables what-if scenarios of HPC systems to evaluate sustainability, and the impact on the simulated system.</description>
