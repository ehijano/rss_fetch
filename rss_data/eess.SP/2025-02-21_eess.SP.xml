      <title>Bridging Simulation and Reality: A 3D Clustering-Based Deep Learning Model for UAV-Based RF Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of radio frequency (RF) sources has critical applications, including search and rescue, jammer detection, and monitoring of hostile activities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant advantages for RF source localization (RFSL) over terrestrial methods, leveraging autonomous 3D navigation and improved signal capture at higher altitudes. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have further enhanced localization accuracy, particularly for outdoor scenarios. DL models often face challenges in real-world performance, as they are typically trained on simulated datasets that fail to replicate real-world conditions fully. To address this, we first propose the Enhanced Two-Ray propagation model, reducing the simulation-to-reality gap by improving the accuracy of propagation environment modeling. For RFSL, we propose the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdaptRNet, a DL-based method leveraging 3D clustering-based feature extraction for robust localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Enhanced Two-Ray model provides superior accuracy in simulating real-world propagation scenarios compared to conventional free-space and two-ray models. Notably, the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdaptRNet, trained entirely on simulated datasets, achieves exceptional performance when validated in real-world environments using the AERPAW physical testbed, with an average localization error of 18.2 m. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, utilizing 33.5 times fewer parameters, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across diverse trajectories, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>IncepFormerNet: A multi-scale multi-head attention network for SSVEP classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have shown outstanding performance in EEG classification tasks, particularly in Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential(SSVEP)-based Brain-Computer-Interfaces(BCI)systems. DL methods have been successfully applied to SSVEP-BCI. This study proposes a new model called IncepFormerNet, which is a hybrid of the Inception and Transformer architectures. IncepFormerNet adeptly extracts multi-scale temporal information from time series data using parallel convolution kernels of varying sizes, accurately capturing the subtle variations and critical features within SSVEP signals.Furthermore, the model integrates the multi-head attention mechanism from the Transformer architecture, which not only provides insights into global dependencies but also significantly enhances the understanding and representation of complex patterns.Additionally, it takes advantage of filter bank techniques to extract features based on the spectral characteristics of SSVEP data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted experiments on two public datasets, . The experimental results show that IncepFormerNet achieves an accuracy of 87.41 on Dataset 1 and 71.97 on Dataset 2 using a 1.0-second time window. To further verify the superiority of the proposed model, we compared it with other deep learning models, and the results indicate that our method achieves significantly higher accuracy than the others.The source codes in this work are available at: https://github.com/CECNL/SSVEP-DAN.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Motion Parameter Estimation: A Variational Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A near-field motion parameter estimation method is proposed. In contract to far-field sensing systems, the near-field sensing system leverages spherical-wave characteristics to enable full-vector location and velocity estimation.
  Despite promising advantages, the near-field sensing system faces a significant challenge, where location and velocity parameters are intricately coupled within the signal.
  To address this challenge, a novel subarray-based variational message passing (VMP) method is proposed for near-field joint location and velocity estimation. First, a factor graph representation is introduced, employing subarray-level directional and Doppler parameters as intermediate variables to decouple the complex location-velocity dependencies.
  Based on this, the variational Bayesian inference is employed to obtain closed-form posterior distributions of subarray-level parameters.
  Subsequently, the message passing technique is employed, enabling tractable computation of location and velocity marginal distributions. Two implementation strategies are proposed: 1) System-level fusion that aggregates all subarray posteriors for centralized estimation, or 2) Subarray-level fusion where locally processed estimates from subarrays are fused through Guassian product rule.
  Cram\'er-Rao bounds for location and velocity estimation are derived, providing theoretical performance limits.
  Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed VMP method outperforms existing approaches while achieving a magnitude lower complexity.
  Specifically, the proposed VMP method achieves centimeter-level location accuracy and sub-m/s velocity accuracy.
  It also demonstrates robust performance for high-mobility targets, making the proposed VMP method suitable for real-time near-field sensing and communication applications.</description>

      <title>AFDM-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Theoretical Framework and Pilot Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as one representative usage scenario of sixth-generation (6G) network. However, the unprecedented characteristics of 6G, especially the doubly dispersive channel, make classical ISAC waveforms rather challenging to guarantee a desirable performance level. The recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) can attain full diversity even under doubly dispersive effects, thus becoming a competitive candidate for next-generation ISAC waveforms. Relevant investigations are still at an early stage, which involve only straightforward design lacking explicit theoretical analysis. This paper provides an in-depth investigation on AFDM waveform design for ISAC applications. Specifically, the closed-form Cr\'{a}mer-Rao bounds of target detection for AFDM are derived, followed by a demonstration on its merits over existing counterparts. Furthermore, we formulate the ambiguity function of the pilot-assisted AFDM waveform for the first time, revealing conditions for stable sensing performance. To further enhance both the communication and sensing performance of the AFDM waveform, we propose a novel pilot design by exploiting the characteristics of AFDM signals. The proposed design is analytically validated to be capable of optimizing the ambiguity function property and channel estimation accuracy simultaneously as well as overcoming the sensing and channel estimation range limitation originated from the pilot spacing. Numerical results have verified the superiority of the proposed pilot design in terms of dual-functional performance.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Placement Design of Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have recently been proposed as a new candidate for flexible-antenna systems, not only inheriting the reconfiguration capability but also offering a unique feature: establishing line-of-sight links to mitigate large-scale path loss. However, sophisticated optimization of the placement of pinching antennas has very high complexity, which is challenging for practical implementation. This paper proposes a low-complexity placement design, providing the closed-form expression of the placement of pinching antennas, to maximize the sum rate of multiple downlink users. Orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are both investigated when the pinching-antenna system is only equipped with a single antenna and only the OMA case is studied when there are multiple antennas equipped by the pinching-antenna system. Simulation results indicate pinching-antenna systems can outperform conventional fixed-antenna systems and are more suitable for large service areas.</description>

      <title>Road to 6G Digital Twin Networks: Multi-Task Adaptive Ray-Tracing as a Key Enabler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a virtual, synchronized replica of physical network, the digital twin network (DTN) is envisioned to sense, predict, optimize and manage the intricate wireless technologies and architectures brought by 6G. Given that the properties of wireless channel fundamentally determine the system performances from the physical layer to network layer, it is a critical prerequisite that the invisible wireless channel in physical world be accurately and efficiently twinned. To support 6G DTN, this paper first proposes a multi-task adaptive ray-tracing platform for 6G (MART-6G) to generate the channel with 6G features, specially designed for DTN online real-time and offline high-accurate tasks. Specifically, the MART-6G platform comprises three core modules, i.e., environment twin module to enhance the sensing ability of dynamic environment; RT engine module to incorporate the main algorithms of propagations, accelerations, calibrations, 6G-specific new features; and channel twin module to generate channel multipath, parameters, statistical distributions, and corresponding three-dimensional (3D) environment information. Moreover, MART-6G is tailored for DTN tasks through the adaptive selection of proper sensing methods, antenna and material libraries, propagation models and calibration strategy, etc. To validate MART-6G performance, we present two real-world case studies to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and generality in both offline coverage prediction and online real-time channel prediction. Finally, some open issues and challenges are outlined to further support future diverse DTN tasks.</description>

      <title>Joint Waveform and Beamforming Design in RIS-ISAC Systems: A Model-Driven Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for future wireless systems. The recently developed symbol-level precoding (SLP) technique holds significant potential for ISAC waveform design, as it leverages both temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance multi-user communication and radar sensing capabilities. Concurrently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer additional controllable propagation paths, further amplifying interest in their application. However, previous studies have encountered substantial computational challenges due to the complexity of jointly designing SLP-based waveforms and RIS passive beamforming. In this paper, we propose a novel model-driven learning approach that jointly optimizes waveform and beamforming by unfolding the iterative alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Two joint design algorithms are developed for radar target detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation tasks in a cluttered RIS-ISAC system. While ensuring the communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, our objectives are: 1) to maximize the radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for target detection, and 2) to minimize the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for DoA estimation. Simulation results verify that our proposed model-driven learning algorithms achieve satisfactory communication and sensing performance, while also offering a substantial reduction in computational complexity, as reflected by the average execution time.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Degrees of Freedom for Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of a continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based continuous electromagnetic (EM) channel are analyzed. To this end, a simplified spatial model is derived using the Fresnel approximation. Leveraging this model and Landau's theorem, a closed-form expression for the spatial DoFs is derived. It is demonstrated that the number of DoFs is proportional to the transmit and receive aperture sizes while being inversely proportional to the propagation distance. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of the derived expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate physical activity level (PAL) classification could be beneficial for osteoarthritis (OA) management. This study examines the impact of sensor placement and deep learning models on AL classification using the Metabolic Equivalent of Task values. The results show that the addition of anankle sensor (WA) significantly improves the classification of intensity activities compared to wrist-only configuration(53% to 86.2%). The CNN-LSTM model achieves the highest accuracy (95.09%). Statistical analysis confirms multi-sensor setups outperform single-sensor configurations (p &lt; 0.05). The WA configuration offers a balance between usability and accuracy, making it a cost-effective solution for AL monitoring, particularly in OA management.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Spectrum Efficiency of Data-Carrying Reference Signals via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-carrying reference signals are a type of reference signal (RS) constructed on the Grassmann manifold, which allows for simultaneous data transmission and channel estimation to achieve boosted spectral efficiency at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, they do not improve spectral efficiency at low to middle SNRs compared with conventional RSs. To address this problem, we propose a numerical optimization-based Grassmann constellation design on the Grassmann manifold that accounts for both data transmission and channel estimation. In our numerical optimization, we derive an upper bound on the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of estimated channel matrices and a lower bound on the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI), and these bounds are optimized simultaneously by using a Bayesian optimization technique. The proposed objective function outperforms conventional design metrics in obtaining Pareto-optimal constellations for NMSE and AMI. The constellation obtained by our method achieves an NMSE comparable to conventional non-data-carrying RSs while enabling data transmission, resulting in superior AMI performance and improved spectral efficiency even at middle SNRs.</description>

      <title>Poststroke rehabilitative mechanisms in individualized fatigue level-controlled treadmill training -- a Rat Model Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individualized training improved post-stroke motor function rehabilitation efficiency. However, the mechanisms of how individualized training facilitates recovery is not clear. This study explored the cortical and corticomuscular rehabilitative effects in post-stroke motor function recovery during individualized training. Sprague-Dawley rats with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were randomly distributed into two groups: forced training (FOR-T, n=13) and individualized fatigue-controlled training (FAT-C, n=13) to receive training respectively from day 2 to day 14 post-stroke. The FAT-C group exhibited superior motor function recovery and less central fatigue compared to the FOR-T group. EEG PSD slope analysis demonstrated a better inter-hemispheric balance in FAT-C group compare to the FOR-T group. The dCMC analysis indicated that training-induced fatigue led to a short-term down-regulation of descending corticomuscular coherence (dCMC) and an up-regulation of ascending dCMC. In the long term, excessive fatigue hindered the recovery of descending control in the affected hemisphere. The individualized strategy of peripheral fatigue-controlled training achieved better motor function recovery, which could be attributed to the mitigation of central fatigue, optimization of inter-hemispheric balance and enhancement of descending control in the affected hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Error Resilience of Iterative Algorithms for Energy Efficiency: from Concept to Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative algorithms are widely used in digital signal processing applications. With the case study of radio astronomy calibration processing, this work contributes towards revealing and exploiting the intrinsic error resilience of iterative algorithms for energy efficiency benefits. We consider iterative methods that use a convergence criterion as a quality metric to terminate the iterative computations. We propose an adaptive statistical approximation model for high-level resilience analysis that provides an opportunity to divide an iterative algorithm into exact and approximate iterations. We realize an energy-efficient accelerator based on a heterogeneous architecture, where the heterogeneity is introduced using accurate and approximate processing cores. Our proposed methodology exploits the error-resilience of the algorithm, where initial iterations are processed on approximate modules while the later ones on accurate modules. The proposed accelerator design does not increase the number of iterations as compared to that of an accurate counterpart and provides sufficient precision to converge to an acceptable solution. Our implementation using TSMC 40nm Low Power (TCBN40LP) technology shows 23% savings in electrical energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for OFDM Radar Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method to reduce interference in OFDM radar systems through the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). The method involves adjusting the RIS elements to diminish interference effects and improve the clarity of the desired signal. A neural network framework is established to optimize the configurations of the RIS, aiming to lower the power from unwanted sources while enhancing the target signal. The network produces settings that focus on maximizing the signal at the intended angle. Utilizing a convolution-based approach, we illustrate the effective tuning of RIS elements for interference mitigation and the creation of nulls in the direction of interference, resulting in a better signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in a radar context, demonstrating its capability to enhance target detection while reducing interference.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Optimal Solutions and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14198</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by movable antennas (MAs), which can dynamically adjust antenna positions to enhance both sensing and communication performance for future wireless networks. To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we first derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized for optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. In particular, for the case with receive MAs only, we provide a closed-form optimal antenna position solution, and show that employing MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) can achieve a sensing performance gain upper-bounded by 4.77 dB. On the other hand, for the case with transmit MAs only, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution in the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. While in the scenario with non-LoS (NLoS) channels, a majorization-minimization (MM) based Rosen's gradient projection (RGP) algorithm with an efficient initialization method is proposed to obtain stationary solutions for the considered problem, which can be extended to the general case with both transmit and receive MAs. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with FPAs in terms of sensing and communication performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Pavement Sensor Data Acquisition for AI-Driven Transportation Research</title>

Abstract: Effective strategies for sensor data management are essential for advancing transportation research, especially in the current data-driven era, due to the advent of novel applications in artificial intelligence. This paper presents comprehensive guidelines for managing transportation sensor data, encompassing both archived static data and real-time data streams. The real-time system architecture integrates various applications with data acquisition systems (DAQ). By deploying the in-house designed, open-source Avena software platform alongside the NATS messaging system as a secure communication broker, reliable data exchange is ensured. While robust databases like TimescaleDB facilitate organized storage, visualization platforms like Grafana provide real-time monitoring capabilities.
  In contrast, static data standards address the challenges in handling unstructured, voluminous datasets. The standards advocate for a combination of cost-effective bulk cloud storage for unprocessed sensor data and relational databases for recording summarized analyses. They highlight the role of cloud data transfer tools like FME for efficient migration of sensor data from local storages onto the cloud. Further, integration of robust visualization tools into the framework helps in deriving patterns and trends from these complex datasets.
  The proposals were applied to INDOT's real-world case studies involving the I-65 and I-69 Greenfield districts. For real-time data collection, Campbell Scientific DAQ systems were used, enabling continuous generation and monitoring of sensor metrics. In the case of the archived I-69 database, summary data was compiled in Oracle, while the unprocessed data was stored in SharePoint. The results underline the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines and motivate their adoption in research projects.</description>

      <title>Role of the Pretraining and the Adaptation data sizes for low-resource real-time MRI video segmentation</title>

Abstract: Real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI) is frequently used in speech production studies as it provides a complete view of the vocal tract during articulation. This study investigates the effectiveness of rtMRI in analyzing vocal tract movements by employing the SegNet and UNet models for Air-Tissue Boundary (ATB)segmentation tasks. We conducted pretraining of a few base models using increasing numbers of subjects and videos, to assess performance on two datasets. First, consisting of unseen subjects with unseen videos from the same data source, achieving 0.33% and 0.91% (Pixel-wise Classification Accuracy (PCA) and Dice Coefficient respectively) better than its matched condition. Second, comprising unseen videos from a new data source, where we obtained an accuracy of 99.63% and 98.09% (PCA and Dice Coefficient respectively) of its matched condition performance. Here, matched condition performance refers to the performance of a model trained only on the test subjects which was set as a benchmark for the other models. Our findings highlight the significance of fine-tuning and adapting models with limited data. Notably, we demonstrated that effective model adaptation can be achieved with as few as 15 rtMRI frames from any new dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Management for the Uplink of Wideband Hybrid Beamforming System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the radio resource management (RRM) for the \emph{uplink} (UL) of a cellular system with codebook-based \emph{hybrid beamforming}. We consider the often neglected but highly practical multi-channel case with fewer radio frequency chains in the base station than user equipment (UEs) in the cell, assuming one RF chain per UE. As for any UL RRM, a per-time slot solution is needed as the allocation of power to subchannels by a UE can only be done once it knows which subchannels it has been allocated. The RRM in this system comprises beam selection, user selection and power allocation, three steps that are intricately coupled and we will show that the order in which they are performed does impact performance and so does the amount of coupling that we take into account. Specifically, we propose 4 online sequential solutions with different orders in which the steps are called and of different complexities, i.e., different levels of coupling between the steps. Our extensive numerical campaign for a mmWave system shows how a well-designed heuristic that takes some level of couplings between the steps can make the performance exceedingly better than a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional data on non-Euclidean domains by utilizing graph signals defined on graph vertices. In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Near-Field ISAC with Modular XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel modular extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed in this paper. We consider a downlink ISAC scenario and exploit the modular array architecture to enhance the communication spectral efficiency and sensing resolution while reducing the channel modeling complexity by employing the hybrid spherical and planar wavefront model. Considering the hybrid digital-analog structure inherent to modular arrays, we formulate a joint analog-digital beamforming design problem based on the communication spectral efficiency and sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). By exploring the structural similarity of the communication and sensing channels, it is proved that the optimal transmit covariance matrix lies in the subspace spanned by the subarray response vectors, yielding a closed-form solution for the optimal analog beamformer. Consequently, the joint design problem is transformed into a low-dimensional rank-constrained digital beamformer optimization. We first propose a manifold optimization method that directly optimizes the digital beamformer on the rank-constrained Stiefel manifold. Additionally, we develop an semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based approach that relaxes the rank constraint and employ the randomization technique to obtain a near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modular XL-MIMO ISAC framework and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Expanding Over-the-Air Computation with Frequency Modulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we introduce Logarithmic Frequency Shift Keying (Log-FSK), a novel frequency modulation for over-the-air computation (AirComp). Log-FSK leverages non-linear signal processing to produce AirComp in the frequency domain, this is, the maximum frequency of the received signal corresponds to the sum of the individual transmitted frequencies. The demodulation procedure relies on the inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the extraction of the maximum frequency component. Log-FSK enables the computation of functions beyond the sum by incorporating nomographic function representation. Furthermore, unlike existing AirComp modulations, Log-FSK allows to compute several functions in a single transmission. We evaluate the capabilities of the scheme in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and flat-fading channels. To demonstrate its practicality, we present specific applications and experimental results showcasing the effectiveness of Log-FSK AirComp within linear Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Our numerical results show that Log-FSK outperform linear analog modulations in terms of MSE and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Robust Feature Engineering Techniques for Designing Efficient Motor Imagery-Based BCI-Systems</title>

Abstract: A multitude of individuals across the globe grapple with motor disabilities. Neural prosthetics utilizing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology exhibit promise for improving motor rehabilitation outcomes. The intricate nature of EEG data poses a significant hurdle for current BCI systems. Recently, a qualitative repository of EEG signals tied to both upper and lower limb execution of motor and motor imagery tasks has been unveiled. Despite this, the productivity of the Machine Learning (ML) Models that were trained on this dataset was alarmingly deficient, and the evaluation framework seemed insufficient. To enhance outcomes, robust feature engineering (signal processing) methodologies are implemented. A collection of time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet-derived features was obtained from 16-channel EEG signals, and the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) approach was employed to identify the four most significant features. For classification K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB) models were implemented with these selected features, evaluating their effectiveness through metrics such as testing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. By leveraging SVM with a Gaussian Kernel, a remarkable maximum testing accuracy of 92.50% for motor activities and 95.48% for imagery activities is achieved. These results are notably more dependable and gratifying compared to the previous study, where the peak accuracy was recorded at 74.36%. This research work provides an in-depth analysis of the MI Limb EEG dataset and it will help in designing and developing simple, cost-effective and reliable BCI systems for neuro-rehabilitation.</description>

Abstract: The channel statistics of a continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based channel are analyzed using its continuous electromagnetic (EM) properties. The received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is discussed under isotropic scattering conditions. Using Landau's theorem, the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation of the EM fading channel are shown to exhibit a step-like behavior. Building on this, closed-form expressions for the probability distribution of the SNR and the average channel capacity are derived. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of the derivations.</description>

      <title>Towards Generative Ray Path Sampling for Faster Point-to-Point Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>

      <title>Herglotz-NET: Implicit Neural Representation of Spherical Data with Harmonic Positional Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing and processing data in spherical domains presents unique challenges, primarily due to the curvature of the domain, which complicates the application of classical Euclidean techniques. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising alternative for high-fidelity data representation; however, to effectively handle spherical domains, these methods must be adapted to the inherent geometry of the sphere to maintain both accuracy and stability. In this context, we propose Herglotz-NET (HNET), a novel INR architecture that employs a harmonic positional encoding based on complex Herglotz mappings. This encoding yields a well-posed representation on the sphere with interpretable and robust spectral properties. Moreover, we present a unified expressivity analysis showing that any spherical-based INR satisfying a mild condition exhibits a predictable spectral expansion that scales with network depth. Our results establish HNET as a scalable and flexible framework for accurate modeling of spherical data.</description>
