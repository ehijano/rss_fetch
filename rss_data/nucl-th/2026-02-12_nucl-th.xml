      <title>Improved linear Boltzmann transport model for hadron and jet suppression in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets serve as powerful tomographic probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the expanding landscape of jet observables reveals multi-faceted aspects of jet-medium interactions, a precise and simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and full jets still remains a challenge for theoretical models. In this work, we present two essential improvements to the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to bridge this gap. First, instead of implementing in-medium parton transport after vacuum parton showers complete, we introduce a medium scale at which the parton transport is inserted into the vacuum parton showers, providing a more physical picture of parton-QGP interactions. Second, we incorporate color flow information into the LBT model, enabling string connections between partons whose configurations are correlated with the medium-modified parton showers before hadronization. We demonstrate that both improvements alter the predicted ratio of hadron to jet quenching, leading to a satisfactory description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and jets with different flavors within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Constraining cross sections for unstable $^{153,159}$Gd$(n,\gamma)$ and their astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron capture $(n,\gamma)$ cross sections of Gadolinium (Gd) isotopes are critical to astrophysics research, nuclear reactor designs, and medical applications. However, the available $(n,\gamma)$ data on unstable Gd isotopes are scarce and direct measurement is challenging. In this work, we propose an approach to infer the $(n,\gamma)$ cross sections for unstable $^{153,159}$Gd isotopes by constraining both the $\gamma$-ray strength functions ($\gamma$SFs) and nuclear level densities (NLDs). Specifically, the key $\gamma$SF parameters are adjusted to match the available experimental data, and the NLD parameters are determined by renormalizing microscopic level densities through a Bayesian optimization method. Our approach is verified by comparing our predictions with the experimental $(n,\gamma)$ data for the stable $^{155,157}$Gd isotopes. We then infer the unstable $^{153,159}\text{Gd}(n,\gamma)$ cross sections within the neutron energy range of 0.01--5.0 MeV. The resulting uncertainty is about $30\%$, which is significantly reduced by a factor of 5.5 compared to a large uncertainty of $\sim167\%$ predicted with different nuclear models in TALYS. We further calculate the astrophysical reaction rates for the $^{153,159}\text{Gd}$ isotopes. It is found that the $^{159}\text{Gd}(n,\gamma)$ rate is larger by a factor of $\sim$2.9 than the JINA REACLIB recommendation. This enhancement increases the neutron capture branching ratio at $^{159}$Gd. Consequently, the resulting $^{160}$Gd abundance is increased by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to predictions using the JINA REACLIB rate in $s$-process nucleosynthesis simulations. Our approach is promising for extracting $(n,\gamma)$ data on a wider range of unstable isotopic chains as well as for essential astrophysical reaction network calculations and nuclear science applications.</description>

      <title>Strong potential in a box for applications to femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the short-range nucleon-nucleon interaction is essential for the interpretation of correlation femtoscopy measurements in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions. We present an analytical treatment of the strong interaction in two-nucleon systems by modelling it with a square-well potential and solving the Schroedinger equation in the presence of the Coulomb interaction. The resulting pair wave function is regular at small relative distances and allows for the inclusion of multiple partial waves. We apply this framework to proton-proton femtoscopy and compute theoretical correlation functions for realistic source sizes. We demonstrate that the commonly used Lednicky-Lyuboshits asymptotic approximation overestimates the correlation signal for small sources. Comparisons with numerical calculations using the CATS framework and the Argonne v18 potential show good agreement within current experimental uncertainties. The proposed analytical approach provides a practical and flexible tool for femtoscopic analyses of nucleon and baryon pairs.</description>

      <title>Prediction on total inventory of radioisotopes produced by the interaction of 20Ne beams on 181Ta (110-170 MeV)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to model the evaporation residues produced by the interaction of 108-170 MeV of 20Ne with the 181Ta target using Monte-Carlo PACE4 simulation code. Reaction mechanisms taking place in these interactions along with production cross sections have been discussed. Possibility of the production of clinically important exotic neutron deficient radioisotopes from these interactions have been assessed, but the result is not encouraging for production of radioisotopes useful in nuclear medicine.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Pseudoscalar Meson Structure from Light to Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the structure of pseudoscalar mesons within an algebraic model formulated in the light-front framework. The approach provides a unified description of leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), light-front wave functions (LFWFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs), charge radii, and impact-parameter GPDs (IPS-GPDs), all derived consistently from the same underlying Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Results are discussed for light ($\pi$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($\eta_c$, $\eta_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional landscape of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a recently proposed form-invariant algebraic model for the quark propagator and the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of pseudoscalar mesons to study the internal structure of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons. This model facilitates the construction of the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction, whose projection onto an appropriate flavor-basis leads to the light-front wavefunction for convenient linear combinations of the $s \bar{s}$ and $l\bar{l}\sim(u \bar{u} + d \bar{d})$ states. Using an overlap representation, we compute the valence-quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The construction of the model ensures that this multidimensional quantity is determined entirely by the corresponding valence-quark distribution amplitudes. Once the GPDs are constructed, we carry out a straightforward derivation of other desired physical observables such as the distribution functions and the electromagnetic form factors. We also provide explicit comparisons with available results, demonstrating that the present model offers a consistent physical picture for all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons.</description>

      <title>Emulation of large-scale qubit registers with a phase space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase-space approach is used and benchmarked for the simulation of the continuous-time evolution of large registers of qubits. It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made.</description>

      <title>Wave Propagation and Effective Refraction in Lorentz-Violating Wormhole Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of massless scalar waves in static, spherically symmetric Lorentz-violating wormhole spacetimes within a geometric-optical framework. Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Observational Probes of the Neutron Star Equation of State with Hyperons, Bosonic Dark Matter, and Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The presence of dark matter in neutron stars is of growing interest due to its potential impact on the structure and observable properties of these objects. Among the various candidates, the hypothetical sexaquark has emerged as a promising bosonic dark matter particle, potentially forming under extreme conditions in neutron star cores.
  Aims. We investigate whether a hybrid neutron star model that includes hyperons, bosonic dark matter (in the form of sexaquarks), and deconfined quark matter can satisfy all current observational constraints. We particularly focus on identifying the range of sexaquark masses consistent with mass-radius measurements and the tidal deformability limit.
  Methods. We used the DD2Y-T model for the hadronic phase, which includes hyperons, and a nonlocal Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for the deconfined quark phase. The phase transition was modeled as a smooth crossover using the replacement interpolation construction method. Sexaquark-baryon interactions were introduced via an effective mass shift representing repulsion. We incorporated the full set of current observational data, including NICER measurements of PSRs J0437-4715 and newly published J0614-3329 data, and performed a Bayesian analysis to constrain the sexaquark mass.
  Results. Our results show that the presence of the sexaquark softens the equation of state, enabling the hybrid model to satisfy both the radius and tidal deformability constraints around the canonical 1.4 M_\odot neutron stars. We find that hybrid EOSs with a sexaquark mass around 1900 MeV are in agreement with all available constraints, including those from HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, which represent the lowest and highest mass neutron stars observed to date. The Bayesian analysis favors a sexaquark mass range of 1885-1935 MeV, supporting the potential relevance of this exotic particle in neutron star interiors.</description>

      <title>Impact of spin polarization on the QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin polarization provides a novel probe of the rotational properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This work investigates the equation of state, particularly its transport and thermodynamic coefficients in noncentral O+O collisions, employing a parton distribution function that incorporates spin polarization induced by thermal vorticity. Within a kinetic theory framework, one finds that the magnitude of the squared speed of sound ($c_s^2$) is only weakly modified by spin polarization, whereas the specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$), specific bulk viscosity ($\zeta/s$), and mean free path ($\lambda$) show substantial changes. When spin polarization is included, both $c_s^2$ and $\zeta/s$ develop a nonmonotonic dependence on the collision energy, with an inflection point near $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=27$ GeV, corresponding to an average parton chemical potential of $\langle\mu_p\rangle=0.021$ GeV. These results suggest that spin polarization may serve as a useful probe for constraining the effective equation of state of QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Cluster-breaking and reconfiguration effects in $_\Lambda^{12}\rm{B}$ hypernucleus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cluster-breaking effect and spatial distribution of negative-parity states in the $_\Lambda^{12}\rm{B}$ hypernucleus using the Hyper-Brink model with cluster-breaking(CB-Hyper-Brink) optimized via Control Neural Network (Ctrl.NN). The results demonstrate that the inclusion of cluster-breaking is essential for accurately reproducing the observed low-lying energy levels and for making reliable predictions of the Hoyle-analog state 1-4 in $_\Lambda^{12}\rm{B}$. Cluster-breaking manifests as strong spin-orbit correlations and the dissolution of ideal cluster configurations, as revealed by the analysis of one-body spin-orbit operator expectation values and the spatial overlap with projected cluster bases. The interplay between short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction in the Lambda N interaction induces the cluster reconfiguration effect, which is characterized by the coexistence of Lambda-alpha and Lambda-triton correlations; this reconfiguration effect leads to a modest stabilization and shrinkage of cluster structures. The variation in electric quadrupole transition strengths, B(E2), between the ground and Hoyle-analog states serves as a sensitive probe for the degree of cluster-breaking, providing direct evidence for its physical relevance. These findings highlight the crucial role of cluster-breaking in characterizing the hypernuclear structure and offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between clustering and shell-model dynamics in hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Feed-down Hadrons in a Thermal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the potential impact of strong decays on the magnitude of fluctuations of net quantum numbers and integrals of balance functions based on a thermal hadron gas model. The calculations are based on a comprehensive list of known hadrons with masses up to 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ and include all decays of these hadrons with known branching fractions. The calculations are performed at vanishing baryo-chemical potential for temperatures between 140 and 200 MeV. We show that the decays feed-down substantially impact the single yield of measurable ``stable particles" as well as those of correlated densities of these species. Decays can then potentially have large and non-trivial impacts on measurements of net quantum number cumulants and balance functions. These observations are particularly important in the context of the search for the QCD critical point at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan as well as efforts to determine chemical susceptibilities near the phase transition at RHIC or LHC energies. Results obtained in this work also shed light on the importance of feed-down in measurements of balance functions in elementary p-p and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing $\alpha$ clustering in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at CSR energies using the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of low-energy nuclear collisions to intrinsic nuclear structure by studying the interplay between initial-state geometry and final-state observables in C+C and C+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.36$~GeV, relevant for experiments at the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) facility in Lanzhou and forthcoming experiments at the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) in Huizhou. Calculations are performed within the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM) using Woods--Saxon and triangular $\alpha$-clustered configurations for the $^{12}C$ nucleus. The initial geometry is characterized in terms of transverse size, compactness, eccentricities, and their ensemble-averaged fluctuations. We find that $\alpha$ clustering leads to a more compact participant configuration than the Woods--Saxon case, while transverse-size and eccentricity fluctuations show only weak sensitivity to clustering. At this beam energy, radial observables remain sensitive to geometric compactness, with the ensemble-averaged proton mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ enhanced for $\alpha$-clustered configurations, whereas pions show little sensitivity. The anisotropic response is examined using flow harmonic coefficients. We find an enhancement of the root-mean-square flow magnitudes, $v_n\{2\} = \sqrt{\langle v_n^2\rangle}$, for $\alpha$-clustered configurations at large $N_{part}$, while the ensemble-averaged fluctuation strength of individual harmonics remains small. Symmetric cumulants of the initial-state eccentricities show sensitivity to clustering, whereas the corresponding ensemble-averaged correlations among final-state flow harmonics do not exhibit a comparably strong separation. These results indicate that radial observables and correlation-based flow measurements provide complementary probes of $\alpha$ clustering in low-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

Abstract: In the high-energy limit, perturbative calculations in QCD are conveniently done using the dipole picture which factorizes the scattering amplitude into a perturbative part and the nonperturbative scattering off the nuclear target, described using correlators of Wilson lines. These correlators can be computed in the color-glass condensate effective field theory by using a Gaussian model for the color density of the target. In this work, we generalize the Gaussian model to a generic function that is local in the transverse coordinates and the light-cone time, and show how to compute physical Wilson-line correlators in this model. We also consider a simple model for the color density based on stable probability distributions and show that the small-dipole behavior of the dipole amplitude is modified from quadratic to a power law, where the power is given by the stability parameter of the distribution. This generalization of the Gaussian model is suitable for numerical applications in the high-energy limit and can be used in future phenomenological studies of the nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Softening holographic nuclear matter</title>

Abstract: Baryons in the holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model are described by instanton solutions on the flavor branes. A commonly used approximation for dense baryonic matter replaces the many-instanton solution by a simpler, spatially homogeneous, ansatz, which requires a discontinuity in the holographic direction of the non-abelian gauge field in order to account for topological baryon number. We point out that the simplest configuration with a single jump - often used in previous studies - results in matter at saturation density that is much stiffer than real-world nuclear matter. This is improved, although not completely remedied, by adding a second jump. We present a systematic discussion of all possible configurations up to four jumps, dynamically computing locations of and behavior at the discontinuities. We find solutions that continuously connect to those based on pointlike baryons, thus, for the first time, establishing a concrete link between the instantonic and homogeneous pictures. This is supported by translating the multi-jump profiles of the gauge field into gauge invariant multi-layer charge distributions. The most important of our novel configurations has a block-like structure in the bulk, becomes pointlike at low density and/or large coupling, and is energetically preferred over all previously studied configurations. Therefore, our work lays the ground for improved predictions from holography for dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>
