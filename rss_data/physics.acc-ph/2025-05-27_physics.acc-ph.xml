      <title>Electron and positron channeling and photon emission processes in boron doped periodically bent diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted of the profiles of the planar (-110) crystallographic direction in the diamond layer doped with boron atoms. The planar profiles for periodic doping following several ideal dependencies of the boron concentration on the distance in the crystalline medium. Numerical simulations of the channeling and photon emission processes have been carried out for 855 MeV electron and 530 MeV positron beams incident on boron-doped diamond with a four-period bending profile in the samples grown at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The simulations were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. It is shown that the channeling efficiency and the intensity of the crystalline undulator radiation strongly depend on the orientation of the incident beam relative to the bent channel profile at the entrance to the boron-doped layer. For the same conditions at the crystal entrance, the intensity of radiation emitted by positrons is significantly higher than that for electrons.</description>

      <title>Parametric mapping of the efficiency$\unicode{x2013}$instability relation in plasma-wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High efficiency is essential for plasma-wakefield accelerators to be a cost-effective alternative in high-power applications, such as a linear collider. However, in a plasma-wakefield accelerator the beam-breakup instability can be seeded by a transverse offset between the driver and trailing bunch. This instability, which rapidly increases the oscillation amplitude of the trailing bunch, grows with higher power-transfer efficiency from the driver to the trailing bunch [V. Lebedev et al., Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 21, 059901 (2018)]. In this paper, we use particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the efficiency$\unicode{x2013}$instability relation that constrains the driver-to-trailing-bunch power-transfer efficiency in beam-driven plasma accelerators. We test the relation using a grid of simulations across all parameters that affect the beam-breakup instability, assuming a uniform accelerating field (optimal beam loading) and no ion motion. We find that the previously proposed efficiency$\unicode{x2013}$instability relation represents a lower limit on the strength of the instability for a given efficiency. For each normalized wake radius, only a certain accelerating field reaches this lowest value of the transverse instability; deviating from this point can increase the growth rate by several orders of magnitude. Lastly, we highlight how the oscillation-amplitude growth of the trailing bunch can be reduced or damped with an initial uncorrelated energy spread and the presence of ion motion.</description>

      <title>Collider-quality electron bunches from an all-optical plasma photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad). Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$ nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider applications making a significant step towards the realization of high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.</description>

      <title>A Strong-QCD Regime Measurement of the Proton's Spin Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) remains one of the most important ways to understand the fundamental properties of ordinary matter. However, at low momentum transfer Q2, in the regime where the strong force becomes extremely strong, our understanding of QCD for ordinary nucleons becomes hazy. Several cutting edge theories such as Chiral Perturbation Theory and Lattice QCD have provided valuable predictions in this regime, but Lattice QCD has not yet extended predictions of many important quantities to this kinematic region, and Chiral Perturbation Theory has faced several important disagreements with experimental data for the neutron over the last several decades. It is therefore of extreme importance to have a benchmark of experimental data in the low energy regime for the proton's behavior, as a test of leading theories for the behavior of QCD in this regime. The E08-027 (g2p) experiment ran at Jefferson Lab in 2012 with the goal of collecting this valuable data. Full details of the g2p experiment and my experimental work at the University of New Hampshire are presented in this thesis, as well as a detailed description of the analysis process and the exciting benchmark results, which serve as a direct test of all current and future theories of QCD in the low-Q2 regime.</description>
