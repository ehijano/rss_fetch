      <title>INTACT: Compact Storage of Data Streams in Mobile Devices to Unlock User Privacy at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data streams produced by mobile devices, such as smartphones, offer highly valuable sources of information to build ubiquitous services. Such data streams are generally uploaded and centralized to be processed by third parties, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. In this context, existing protection mechanisms, such as Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs), have been investigated. Alas, none of them have actually been implemented, nor deployed in real-life, in mobile devices to enforce user privacy at the edge. Moreover, the diversity of embedded sensors and the resulting data deluge makes it impractical to provision such services directly on mobiles, due to their constrained storage capacity, communication bandwidth and processing power. This article reports on the FLI technique, which leverages a piece-wise linear approximation technique to capture compact representations of data streams in mobile devices. Beyond the FLI storage layer, we introduce Divide \&amp; Stay, a new privacy preservation technique to execute Points of Interest (POIs) inference. Finally, we deploy both of them on Android and iOS as the INTACT framework, making a concrete step towards enforcing privacy and trust in ubiquitous computing systems.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Matroid Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of constructing fault-tolerant bases in matroids. Given a matroid M and a redundancy parameter k, a k-fault-tolerant basis is a minimum-size set of elements such that, even after the removal of any k elements, the remaining subset still spans the entire ground set. Since matroids generalize linear independence across structures such as vector spaces, graphs, and set systems, this problem unifies and extends several fault-tolerant concepts appearing in prior research.
  Our main contribution is a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for the k-fault-tolerant basis problem, parameterized by both k and the rank r of the matroid. This two-variable parameterization by k + r is shown to be tight in the following sense. On the one hand, the problem is already NP-hard for k=1. On the other hand, it is Para-NP-hard for r \geq 3 and polynomial-time solvable for r \leq 2.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Directed Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Directed Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem in which the edges in the graph are directed and a vertex and edge can be visited multiple times. The goal is to find a directed closed walk of minimum length (or total weight) that visits every vertex of the given graph at least once. In a yet more general version, Directed Waypoint Routing Problem (DWRP), some vertices are marked as terminals and we are only required to visit all terminals. Furthermore, each edge has its capacity bounding the number of times this edge can be used by a solution.
  While both problems (and many other variants of TSP) were extensively investigated, mostly from the approximation point of view, there are surprisingly few results concerning the parameterized complexity. Our starting point is the result of Marx et al. [APPROX/RANDOM 2016] who proved that DTSP is W[1]-hard parameterized by distance to pathwidth 3. In this paper we aim to initiate the systematic complexity study of variants of DTSP with respect to various, mostly structural, parameters.
  We show that DWRP is FPT parameterized by the solution size, the feedback edge number, and the vertex integrity of the underlying undirected graph. Furthermore, the problem is XP parameterized by treewidth. On the complexity side, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the distance to constant treedepth.</description>

      <title>Shortest Paths in Multimode Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study shortest path problems in multimode graphs, a generalization of the min-distance measure introduced by Abboud, Vassilevska W. and Wang in [SODA'16]. A multimode shortest path is the shortest path using one of multiple `modes' of transportation that cannot be combined. This represents real-world scenarios where different modes are not combinable, such as flights operated by different airlines. More precisely, a $k$-multimode graph is a collection of $k$ graphs on the same vertex set and the $k$-mode distance between two vertices is defined as the minimum among the distances computed in each individual graph.
  We focus on approximating fundamental graph parameters on these graphs, specifically diameter and radius. In undirected multimode graphs we first show an elegant linear time 3-approximation algorithm for 2-mode diameter. We then extend this idea into a general subroutine that can be used as a part of any $\alpha$-approximation, and use it to construct a 2 and 2.5 approximation algorithm for 2-mode diameter. For undirected radius, we introduce a general scheme that can compute a 3-approximation of the $k$-mode radius for any $k$. In the directed case we develop novel techniques to construct a linear time algorithm to determine whether the diameter is finite.
  We also develop many conditional fine-grained lower bounds for various multimode diameter and radius approximation problems. We are able to show that many of our algorithms are tight under popular fine-grained complexity hypotheses, including our linear time 3-approximation for $3$-mode undirected diameter and radius. As part of this effort we propose the first extension to the Hitting Set Hypothesis [SODA'16], which we call the $\ell$-Hitting Set Hypothesis. We use this hypothesis to prove the first parameterized lower bound tradeoff for radius approximation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Faster exponential algorithms for cut problems via geometric data structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many hard computational problems, simple algorithms that run in time $2^n \cdot n^{O(1)}$ arise, say, from enumerating all subsets of a size-$n$ set. Finding (exponentially) faster algorithms is a natural goal that has driven much of the field of exact exponential algorithms (e.g., see Fomin and Kratsch, 2010). In this paper we obtain algorithms with running time $O(1.9999977^n)$ on input graphs with $n$ vertices, for the following well-studied problems:
  - $d$-Cut: find a proper cut in which no vertex has more than $d$ neighbors on the other side of the cut;
  - Internal Partition: find a proper cut in which every vertex has at least as many neighbors on its side of the cut as on the other side; and
  - ($\alpha,\beta$)-Domination: given intervals $\alpha,\beta \subseteq [0,n]$, find a subset $S$ of the vertices, so that for every vertex $v \in S$ the number of neighbors of $v$ in $S$ is from $\alpha$ and for every vertex $v \notin S$, the number of neighbors of $v$ in $S$ is from $\beta$.
  Our algorithms are exceedingly simple, combining the split and list technique (Horowitz and Sahni, 1974; Williams, 2005) with a tool from computational geometry: orthogonal range searching in the moderate dimensional regime (Chan, 2017). Our technique is applicable to the decision, optimization and counting versions of these problems and easily extends to various generalizations with more fine-grained, vertex-specific constraints, as well as to directed, balanced, and other variants. Algorithms with running times of the form $c^n$, for $c&lt;2$, were known for the first problem only for constant $d$, and for the third problem for certain special cases of $\alpha$ and $\beta$; for the second problem we are not aware of such results.</description>

      <title>Computing Maximum Cliques in Unit Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, the unit-disk graph $G(P)$ is a graph with $P$ as its vertex set such that two points of $P$ have an edge if their Euclidean distance is at most $1$. We consider the problem of computing a maximum clique in $G(P)$. The previously best algorithm for the problem runs in $O(n^{7/3+o(1)})$ time. We show that the problem can be solved in $O(n \log n + n K^{4/3+o(1)})$ time, where $K$ is the maximum clique size. The algorithm is faster than the previous one when $K=o(n)$. In addition, if $P$ is in convex position, we give a randomized algorithm that runs in $O(n^{15/7+o(1)})= O(n^{2.143})$ worst-case time and the algorithm can compute a maximum clique with high probability. For points in convex position, one special case we solve is when a point in the maximum clique is given; we present an $O(n^2\log n)$ time (deterministic) algorithm for this special case.</description>

      <title>Are there graphs whose shortest path structure requires large edge weights?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aspect ratio of a (positively) weighted graph $G$ is the ratio of its maximum edge weight to its minimum edge weight. Aspect ratio commonly arises as a complexity measure in graph algorithms, especially related to the computation of shortest paths. Popular paradigms are to interpolate between the settings of weighted and unweighted input graphs by incurring a dependence on aspect ratio, or by simply restricting attention to input graphs of low aspect ratio.
  This paper studies the effects of these paradigms, investigating whether graphs of low aspect ratio have more structured shortest paths than graphs in general. In particular, we raise the question of whether one can generally take a graph of large aspect ratio and reweight its edges, to obtain a graph with bounded aspect ratio while preserving the structure of its shortest paths. Our findings are:
  - Every weighted DAG on $n$ nodes has a shortest-paths preserving graph of aspect ratio $O(n)$. A simple lower bound shows that this is tight.
  - The previous result does not extend to general directed or undirected graphs; in fact, the answer turns out to be exponential in these settings. In particular, we construct directed and undirected $n$-node graphs for which any shortest-paths preserving graph has aspect ratio $2^{\Omega(n)}$.
  We also consider the approximate version of this problem, where the goal is for shortest paths in $H$ to correspond to approximate shortest paths in $G$. We show that our exponential lower bounds extend even to this setting. We also show that in a closely related model, where approximate shortest paths in $H$ must also correspond to approximate shortest paths in $G$, even DAGs require exponential aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Max-Distance Sparsification for Diversification and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a set family that is the solution domain of some combinatorial problem. The \emph{max-min diversification problem on $\mathcal{D}$} is the problem to select $k$ sets from $\mathcal{D}$ such that the Hamming distance between any two selected sets is at least $d$. FPT algorithms parameterized by $k+\ell $, where $\ell=\max_{D\in \mathcal{D}}|D|$, and $k+d$ have been actively studied recently for several specific domains.
  This paper provides unified algorithmic frameworks to solve this problem. Specifically, for each parameterization $k+\ell $ and $k+d$, we provide an FPT oracle algorithm for the max-min diversification problem using oracles related to $\mathcal{D}$. We then demonstrate that our frameworks provide the first FPT algorithms on several new domains $\mathcal{D}$, including the domain of $t$-linear matroid intersection, almost $2$-SAT, minimum edge $s,t$-flows, vertex sets of $s,t$-mincut, vertex sets of edge bipartization, and Steiner trees. We also demonstrate that our frameworks generalize most of the existing domain-specific tractability results.
  Our main technical breakthrough is introducing the notion of \emph{max-distance sparsifier} of $\mathcal{D}$, a domain on which the max-min diversification problem is equivalent to the same problem on the original domain $\mathcal{D}$. The core of our framework is to design FPT oracle algorithms that construct a constant-size max-distance sparsifier of $\mathcal{D}$. Using max-distance sparsifiers, we provide FPT algorithms for the max-min and max-sum diversification problems on $\mathcal{D}$, as well as $k$-center and $k$-sum-of-radii clustering problems on $\mathcal{D}$, which are also natural problems in the context of diversification and have their own interests.</description>

      <title>Practical and Accurate Local Edge Differentially Private Graph Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using local differential privacy (LDP), which enforces privacy at the individual level, where no third-party entity is trusted, unlike centralized models that assume a trusted curator. We introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph statistics: k-core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages input-dependent private graph properties, specifically the degeneracy and maximum degree of the graph, to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior methods, our error bounds are determined by the maximum degree rather than the total number of edges, resulting in significantly tighter guarantees. For triangle counting, we improve upon the work of Imola, Murakami, and Chaudhury [USENIX Security `21, `22], which bounds error in terms of edge count. Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et al.'s randomized response technique [ICALP `23], and a novel analysis, yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show substantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x of exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala et al. [FOCS `22]. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative approximation errors by up to six orders of magnitude, while maintaining competitive runtime.</description>

      <title>Is it easier to count communities than find them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graph models with community structure have been studied extensively in the literature. For both the problems of detecting and recovering community structure, an interesting landscape of statistical and computational phase transitions has emerged. A natural unanswered question is: might it be possible to infer properties of the community structure (for instance, the number and sizes of communities) even in situations where actually finding those communities is believed to be computationally hard? We show the answer is no. In particular, we consider certain hypothesis testing problems between models with different community structures, and we show (in the low-degree polynomial framework) that testing between two options is as hard as finding the communities.
  Our methods give the first computational lower bounds for testing between two different ``planted'' distributions, whereas previous results have considered testing between a planted distribution and an i.i.d. ``null'' distribution. We also show a formal relationship between the low--degree frameworks for recovery in a planted model and for testing two planted models.</description>

      <title>Reductions in local certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local certification is a topic originating from distributed computing, where a prover tries to convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$. To convince the vertices, the prover gives a small piece of information, called certificate, to each vertex, and the vertices then decide whether the property $\mathcal{P}$ is satisfied by just looking at their certificate and the certificates of their neighbors. When studying a property $\mathcal{P}$ in the perspective of local certification, the aim is to find the optimal size of the certificates needed to certify $\mathcal{P}$, which can be viewed a measure of the local complexity of $\mathcal{P}$.
  A certification scheme is considered to be efficient if the size of the certificates is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. While there have been a number of meta-theorems providing efficient certification schemes for general graph classes, the proofs of the lower bounds on the size of the certificates are usually very problem-dependent.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of hardness reduction in local certification, and show that we can transfer a lower bound on the certificates for a property $\mathcal{P}$ to a lower bound for another property $\mathcal{P}'$, via a (local) hardness reduction from $\mathcal{P}$ to $\mathcal{P}'$. We then give a number of applications in which we obtain polynomial lower bounds for many classical properties using such reductions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reconfiguration of Tile Arrangements by a Single Active Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconfiguring a two-dimensional connected grid arrangement of passive building blocks from a start configuration to a goal configuration, using a single active robot that can move on the tiles, remove individual tiles from a given location and physically move them to a new position by walking on the remaining configuration. The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the overall makespan, while keeping the tile configuration connected.
  We provide both negative and positive results. (1) We generalize the problem by introducing weighted movement costs, which can vary depending on whether tiles are carried or not, and prove that this variant is NP-hard. (2) We give a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for the case of disjoint start and target bounding boxes, which additionally yields optimal carry distance for 2-scaled instances.</description>
