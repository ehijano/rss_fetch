      <title>Cooperation, Correlation and Competition in Ergodic $N$-player Games and Mean-field Games of Singular Controls: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ergodic symmetric $N$-player and mean-field games of singular control in both cooperative and competitive settings. The state process dynamics of a representative player follow geometric Brownian motion, controlled additively through a nondecreasing process. Agents aim to maximize a long-time average reward functional with instantaneous profit of power type. The game shows strategic complementarities, in that the marginal profit function is increasing with respect to the dynamic average of the states of the other players, when $N&lt;\infty$, or with respect to the stationary mean of the players' distribution, in the mean-field case. In the mean-field formulation, we explicitly construct the solution to the mean-field control problem associated with central planner optimization, as well as Nash and coarse correlated equilibria (with singular and regular recommendations). Among our findings, we show that coarse correlated equilibria may exist even when Nash equilibria do not. Additionally, we show that a coarse correlated equilibrium with a regular (absolutely continuous) recommendation can outperform a Nash equilibrium where the equilibrium policy is of reflecting type (thus singularly continuous). Furthermore, we prove that the constructed mean-field control and mean-field equilibria can approximate the cooperative and competitive equilibria, respectively, in the corresponding game with $N$ players when $N$ is sufficiently large. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to characterize coarse correlated equilibria, construct the explicit solution to an ergodic mean-field control problem, and provide approximation results for the related $N$-player game in the context of singular control games.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Factor Models for Different Periods of the Electricity Spot Price Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to major shifts in European energy supply, a structural change can be observed in Austrian electricity spot price data starting from the second quarter of the year 2021 onward. In this work we study the performance of two different factor models for the electricity spot price in three different time periods. To this end, we consider three samples of EEX data for the Austrian base load electricity spot price, one from the pre-crises from 2018 to 2021, the second from the time of the crisis from 2021 to 2023 and the whole data from 2018 to 2023. For each of these samples, we investigate the fit of a classical 3-factor model with a Gaussian base signal and one positive and one negative jump signal and compare it with a 4-factor model to assess the effect of adding a second Gaussian base signal to the model. For the calibration of the models we develop a tailor-made Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Gibbs sampling. To evaluate the model adequacy, we provide simulations of the spot price as well as a posterior predictive check for the 3- and the 4-factor model. We find that the 4-factor model outperforms the 3-factor model in times of non-crises. In times of crises, the second Gaussian base signal does not lead to a better fit of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding stochastic electricity spot price models in this new market environment. Hence, it serves as a solid base for future research.</description>

      <title>Risk-Averse Markov Decision Processes through a Distributional Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By adopting a distributional viewpoint on law-invariant convex risk measures, we construct dynamics risk measures (DRMs) at the distributional level. We then apply these DRMs to investigate Markov decision processes, incorporating latent costs, random actions, and weakly continuous transition kernels. Furthermore, the proposed DRMs allow risk aversion to change dynamically. Under mild assumptions, we derive a dynamic programming principle and show the existence of an optimal policy in both finite and infinite time horizons. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for the optimality of deterministic actions. For illustration, we conclude the paper with examples from optimal liquidation with limit order books and autonomous driving.</description>
