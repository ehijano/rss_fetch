      <title>Thermodynamic Algorithms for Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating computation by harnessing the thermalization properties of physical systems. This work introduces a novel approach to solving quadratic programming problems using thermodynamic hardware. By incorporating a thermodynamic subroutine for solving linear systems into the interior-point method, we present a hybrid digital-analog algorithm that outperforms traditional digital algorithms in terms of speed. Notably, we achieve a polynomial asymptotic speedup compared to conventional digital approaches. Additionally, we simulate the algorithm for a support vector machine and predict substantial practical speedups with only minimal degradation in solution quality. Finally, we detail how our method can be applied to portfolio optimization and the simulation of nonlinear resistive networks.</description>

      <title>AMSnet-KG: A Netlist Dataset for LLM-based AMS Circuit Auto-Design Using Knowledge Graph RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits are mainly full-custom designed, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A significant portion of the effort is experience-driven, which makes the automation of AMS circuit design a formidable challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, fostering advancements in the automatic design process for large-scale AMS circuits. However, the absence of high-quality datasets has led to issues such as model hallucination, which undermines the robustness of automatically generated circuit designs. To address this issue, this paper introduces AMSnet-KG, a dataset encompassing various AMS circuit schematics and netlists. We construct a knowledge graph with annotations on detailed functional and performance characteristics. Facilitated by AMSnet-KG, we propose an automated AMS circuit generation framework that utilizes the comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy (e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on required specifications. Next, matched circuit components are retrieved and assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications are met. We perform case studies of operational amplifier and comparator design to verify the automatic design flow from specifications to netlists with minimal human effort. The dataset used in this paper will be open-sourced upon publishing of this paper.</description>

      <title>SimPhony: A Device-Circuit-Architecture Cross-Layer Modeling and Simulation Framework for Heterogeneous Electronic-Photonic AI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs) offer transformative potential for next-generation high-performance AI but require interdisciplinary advances across devices, circuits, architecture, and design automation. The complexity of hybrid systems makes it challenging even for domain experts to understand distinct behaviors and interactions across design stack. The lack of a flexible, accurate, fast, and easy-to-use EPIC AI system simulation framework significantly limits the exploration of hardware innovations and system evaluations on common benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose SimPhony, a cross-layer modeling and simulation framework for heterogeneous electronic-photonic AI systems. SimPhony offers a platform that enables (1) generic, extensible hardware topology representation that supports heterogeneous multi-core architectures with diverse photonic tensor core designs; (2) optics-specific dataflow modeling with unique multi-dimensional parallelism and reuse beyond spatial/temporal dimensions; (3) data-aware energy modeling with realistic device responses, layout-aware area estimation, link budget analysis, and bandwidth-adaptive memory modeling; and (4) seamless integration with model training framework for hardware/software co-simulation. By providing a unified, versatile, and high-fidelity simulation platform, SimPhony enables researchers to innovate and evaluate EPIC AI hardware across multiple domains, facilitating the next leap in emerging AI hardware.

      <title>Physics-Informed LLM-Agent for Automated Modulation Design in Power Electronics Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents have demonstrated outstanding performance in solving complex industrial tasks. However, in the pursuit of carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, existing AI-assisted design automation faces significant limitations in explainability, scalability, and usability. To address these challenges, we propose LP-COMDA, an LLM-based, physics-informed autonomous agent that automates the modulation design of power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human supervision. Unlike traditional AI-assisted approaches, LP-COMDA contains an LLM-based planner that gathers and validates design specifications through a user-friendly chat interface. The planner then coordinates with physics-informed design and optimization tools to iteratively generate and refine modulation designs autonomously. Through the chat interface, LP-COMDA provides an explainable design process, presenting explanations and charts. Experiments show that LP-COMDA outperforms all baseline methods, achieving a 63.2% reduction in error compared to the second-best benchmark method in terms of standard mean absolute error. Furthermore, empirical studies with 20 experts conclude that design time with LP-COMDA is over 33 times faster than conventional methods, showing its significant improvement on design efficiency over the current processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various collaborative distributed machine learning (CDML) systems, including federated learning systems and swarm learning systems, with diferent key traits were developed to leverage resources for the development and use of machine learning(ML) models in a conidentiality-preserving way. To meet use case requirements, suitable CDML systems need to be selected. However, comparison between CDML systems to assess their suitability for use cases is often diicult. To support comparison of CDML systems and introduce scientiic and practical audiences to the principal functioning and key traits of CDML systems, this work presents a CDML system conceptualization and CDML archetypes.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.</description>
