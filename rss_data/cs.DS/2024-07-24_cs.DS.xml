      <title>Color Refinement for Relational Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color Refinement, also known as Naive Vertex Classification, is a classical method to distinguish graphs by iteratively computing a coloring of their vertices. While it is mainly used as an imperfect way to test for isomorphism, the algorithm permeated many other, seemingly unrelated, areas of computer science. The method is algorithmically simple, and it has a well-understood distinguishing power: It is logically characterized by Cai, F\"urer and Immerman (1992), who showed that it distinguishes precisely those graphs that can be distinguished by a sentence of first-order logic with counting quantifiers and only two variables. A combinatorial characterization is given by Dvo\v{r}\'ak (2010), who shows that it distinguishes precisely those graphs that can be distinguished by the number of homomorphisms from some tree.
  In this paper, we introduce Relational Color Refinement (RCR, for short), a generalization of the Color Refinement method from graphs to arbitrary relational structures, whose distinguishing power admits the equivalent combinatorial and logical characterizations as Color Refinement has on graphs: We show that RCR distinguishes precisely those structures that can be distinguished by the number of homomorphisms from an acyclic relational structure. Further, we show that RCR distinguishes precisely those structures that can be distinguished by a sentence of the guarded fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Two Results on LPT: A Near-Linear Time Algorithm and Parcel Delivery using Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is to increase our understanding of the Longest Processing Time First (LPT) heuristic. LPT is a classical heuristic for the fundamental problem of uniform machine scheduling. For different machine speeds, LPT was first considered by Gonzalez et al (SIAM J. Computing, 1977). Since then, extensive work has been done to improve the approximation factor of the LPT heuristic. However, all known implementations of the LPT heuristic take $O(mn)$ time, where $m$ is the number of machines and $n$ is the number of jobs. In this work, we come up with the first near-linear time implementation for LPT. Specifically, the running time is $O((n+m)(\log^2{m}+\log{n}))$. Somewhat surprisingly, the result is obtained by mapping the problem to dynamic maintenance of lower envelope of lines, which has been well studied in the computational geometry community.
  Our second contribution is to analyze the performance of LPT for the Drones Warehouse Problem (DWP), which is a natural generalization of the uniform machine scheduling problem motivated by drone-based parcel delivery from a warehouse. In this problem, a warehouse has multiple drones and wants to deliver parcels to several customers. Each drone picks a parcel from the warehouse, delivers it, and returns to the warehouse (where it can also get charged). The speeds and battery lives of the drones could be different, and due to the limited battery life, each drone has a bounded range in which it can deliver parcels. The goal is to assign parcels to the drones so that the time taken to deliver all the parcels is minimized. We prove that the natural approach of solving this problem via the LPT heuristic has an approximation factor of $\phi$, where $\phi \approx 1.62$ is the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>Hardness and Approximability of Dimension Reduction on the Probability Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimension reduction is a technique used to transform data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space, aiming to retain as much of the original information as possible. This approach is crucial in many disciplines like engineering, biology, astronomy, and economics. In this paper, we consider the following dimensionality reduction instance: Given an n-dimensional probability distribution p and an integer m&lt;n, we aim to find the m-dimensional probability distribution q that is the closest to p, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the measure of closeness. We prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard, and we present an approximation algorithm for it.</description>

      <title>Canadian Traveller Problems in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formalises the Canadian Traveller problem as a positional two-player game on graphs. We consider two variants depending on whether an edge is blocked. In the locally-informed variant, the traveller learns if an edge is blocked upon reaching one of its endpoints, while in the uninformed variant, they discover this only when the edge is supposed to appear. We provide a polynomial algorithm for each shortest path variant in the uninformed case. This algorithm also solves the case of directed acyclic non-temporal graphs.
  In the locally-informed case, we prove that finding a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we establish that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when $k=1$ but NP-hard for $k\geq 2$.
  Additionally, we show that the standard (non-temporal) Canadian Traveller Problem is NP-hard when there are $k\geq 4$ blocked edges, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first hardness result for CTP for a constant number of blocked edges.</description>

      <title>A Simple Algorithm for Near-Vizing Edge-Coloring in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple $(1+\varepsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring algorithm for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta = \Omega(\log n / \varepsilon)$ with running time $O\left(m\,\log^3 n/\varepsilon^3\right)$. Our algorithm improves upon that of [Duan, He, and Zhang; SODA19], which was the first near-linear time algorithm for this problem. While our results are weaker than the current state-of-the-art, our approach is significantly simpler, both in terms of analysis as well as implementation, and may be of practical interest.</description>

      <title>A Faster Branching Algorithm for the Maximum $k$-Defective Clique Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16588v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-defective clique of an undirected graph $G$ is a subset of its vertices that induces a nearly complete graph with a maximum of $k$ missing edges. The maximum $k$-defective clique problem, which asks for the largest $k$-defective clique from the given graph, is important in many applications, such as social and biological network analysis. In the paper, we propose a new branching algorithm that takes advantage of the structural properties of the $k$-defective clique and uses the efficient maximum clique algorithm as a subroutine. As a result, the algorithm has a better asymptotic running time than the existing ones. We also investigate upper-bounding techniques and propose a new upper bound utilizing the \textit{conflict relationship} between vertex pairs. Because conflict relationship is common in many graph problems, we believe that this technique can be potentially generalized. Finally, experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on a wide range of open benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new balanced separator theorem for unit-disk graphs involving two shortest paths combined with the 1-hop neighbours of those paths and two other vertices. This answers an open problem of Yan, Xiang and Dragan [CGTA '12] and improves their result that requires removing the 3-hop neighborhood of two shortest paths. Our proof uses very different ideas, including Delaunay triangulations and a generalization of the celebrated balanced separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan [J. Appl. Math. '79] to systems of non-intersecting paths.</description>

      <title>Trickle-Down in Localization Schemes and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trickle-down is a phenomenon in high-dimensional expanders with many important applications -- for example, it is a key ingredient in various constructions of high-dimensional expanders or the proof of rapid mixing for the basis exchange walk on matroids and in the analysis of log-concave polynomials. We formulate a generalized trickle-down equation in the abstract context of linear-tilt localization schemes. Building on this generalization, we improve the best-known results for several Markov chain mixing or sampling problems -- for example, we improve the threshold up to which Glauber dynamics is known to mix rapidly in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model. Other applications of our framework include improved mixing results for the Langevin dynamics in the $O(N)$ model, and near-linear time sampling algorithms for the antiferromagnetic and fixed-magnetization Ising models on expanders. For the latter application, we use a new dynamics inspired by polarization, a technique from the theory of stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Commutative Factors in Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models to allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes. To exploit symmetries in, e.g., factor graphs, it is crucial to identify commutative factors, i.e., factors having symmetries within themselves due to their arguments being exchangeable. The current state of the art to check whether a factor is commutative with respect to a subset of its arguments iterates over all possible subsets of the factor's arguments, i.e., $O(2^n)$ iterations for a factor with $n$ arguments in the worst case. In this paper, we efficiently solve the problem of detecting commutative factors in a factor graph. In particular, we introduce the detection of commutative factors (DECOR) algorithm, which allows us to drastically reduce the computational effort for checking whether a factor is commutative in practice. We prove that DECOR efficiently identifies restrictions to drastically reduce the number of required iterations and validate the efficiency of DECOR in our empirical evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alphabetic codes and binary search trees are combinatorial structures that abstract search procedures in ordered sets endowed with probability distributions. In this paper, we design new linear-time algorithms to construct alphabetic codes, and we show that the obtained codes are not too far from being optimal. Moreover, we exploit our results on alphabetic codes to provide new bounds on the average cost of optimal binary search trees. Our results improve on the best-known bounds on the average cost of optimal binary search trees present in the literature.</description>

      <title>Inference of rankings planted in random tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring an unknown ranking of $n$ items from a random tournament on $n$ vertices whose edge directions are correlated with the ranking. We establish, in terms of the strength of these correlations, the computational and statistical thresholds for detection (deciding whether an observed tournament is purely random or drawn correlated with a hidden ranking) and recovery (estimating the hidden ranking with small error in Spearman's footrule or Kendall's tau metric on permutations). Notably, we find that this problem provides a new instance of a detection-recovery gap: solving the detection problem requires much weaker correlations than solving the recovery problem. In establishing these thresholds, we also identify simple algorithms for detection (thresholding a degree 2 polynomial) and recovery (outputting a ranking by the number of "wins" of a tournament vertex, i.e., the out-degree) that achieve optimal performance up to constants in the correlation strength. For detection, we find that the above low-degree polynomial algorithm is superior to a natural spectral algorithm. We also find that, whenever it is possible to achieve strong recovery (i.e., to estimate with vanishing error in the above metrics) of the hidden ranking, then the above "Ranking By Wins" algorithm not only does so, but also outputs a close approximation of the maximum likelihood estimator, a task that is NP-hard in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Hardness of sampling solutions from the Symmetric Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two related classes of algorithms, stable algorithms and Boolean circuits with bounded depth, cannot produce an approximate sample from the uniform measure over the set of solutions to the symmetric binary perceptron model at any constraint-to-variable density. This result is in contrast to the question of finding \emph{a} solution to the same problem, where efficient (and stable) algorithms are known to succeed at sufficiently low density. This result suggests that the solutions found efficiently -- whenever this task is possible -- must be highly atypical, and therefore provides an example of a problem where search is efficiently possible but approximate sampling from the set of solutions is not, at least within these two classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Static Pricing Guarantees for Queueing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general queueing model with price-sensitive customers in which the service provider seeks to balance two objectives, maximizing the average revenue rate and minimizing the average queue length. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process, observe an offered price, and decide to join the queue if their valuation exceeds the price. The queue is operated first-in first-out, and the service times are exponential. Our model represents applications in areas like make-to-order manufacturing, cloud computing, and food delivery.
  The optimal solution for our model is dynamic; the price changes as the state of the system changes. However, such dynamic pricing policies may be undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this work, we provide performance guarantees for a simple and natural class of static pricing policies which charge a fixed price up to a certain occupancy threshold and then allow no more customers into the system. We provide a series of results showing that such static policies can simultaneously guarantee a constant fraction of the optimal revenue with at most a constant factor increase in expected queue length. For instance, our policy for the M/M/1 setting allows bi-criteria approximations of $(0.5, 1), (0.66, 1.16), (0.75, 1.54)$ and $(0.8, 2)$ for the revenue and queue length, respectively. We also provide guarantees for settings with multiple customer classes and multiple servers, as well as the expected sojourn time objective.</description>

      <title>Arborescences and Shortest Path Trees when Colors Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color-constrained subgraph problems are those where we are given an edge-colored (directed or undirected) graph and the task is to find a specific type of subgraph, like a spanning tree, an arborescence, a single-source shortest path tree, a perfect matching etc., with constraints on the number of edges of each color. Some of these problems, like color-constrained spanning tree, have elegant solutions and some of them, like color-constrained perfect matching, are longstanding open questions. In this work, we study color-constrained arborescences and shortest path trees. Computing a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs turns out to be NP-hard in general but polynomial-time solvable when all cycles have positive weight. This polynomial-time solvability is due to the fact that the solution space is essentially the set of all color-constrained arborescences of a directed acyclic subgraph of the original graph. While finding color-constrained arborescence of digraphs is NP-hard in general, we give efficient algorithms when the input graph is acyclic. Consequently, a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs having only positive weight cycles can be efficiently computed. Our algorithms also generalize to the problem of finding a color-constrained shortest path tree with minimum total weight. En route, we sight nice connections to colored matroids and color-constrained bases.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks for Blockchain Data Sharding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data sharding$\unicode{x2013}$in which block data is sharded without sharding compute$\unicode{x2013}$is at the present the favored approach for scaling Ethereum and other popular blockchains. A key challenge toward implementing data sharding is verifying whether the entirety of a block's data is available in the network (across its shards). A central technique proposed to conduct this verification uses erasure-coded blocks and is called data availability sampling (DAS). While the high-level protocol details of DAS have been well discussed in the community, discussions around how such a protocol will be implemented at the peer-to-peer layer are lacking. We identify random sampling of nodes as a fundamental primitive necessary to carry out DAS and present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of a large number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., 50% of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for DAS functions in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>

  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x = b,\, x \in Z^n_{\geq 0} \bigr\}\text{ with $A \in Z^{k \times n}$, $rank(A) = k$, $b \in Z^{k}$ and}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x \leq b,\, x \in Z^n \bigr\} \text{ with $A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}$, $rank(A) = n$, $b \in Z^{n+k}$.} \end{gather*} The first problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the standard form of the codimension $k$}, and the second problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the canonical form with $n+k$ constraints.} We show that, for any sufficiently large $\Delta$, both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot (f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)^2 / 2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)}\bigr)} $$ operations, where $
  f_{k,d} = \min \Bigl\{ k^{k/2},
  \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (d + k)\bigr)^{k/2}
  \Bigr\} $, $d$ is the dimension of a corresponding polyhedron and $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $rank(A) \times rank(A)$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  As our second main result, we show that the feasibility variants of both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta \cdot \log^3(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta) $$ operations. The constant $f_{k,d}$ can be replaced by other constant $g_{k,\Delta} = \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (k \Delta)\bigr)^{k/2}$ that depends only on $k$ and $\Delta$. Additionally, we consider different partial cases with $k=0$ and $k=1$, which have interesting applications.
  As a result of independent interest, we propose an $n^2/2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log n}\bigr)}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences, indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of the order $n$. Additionally, we give a complete, self-contained error analysis of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform for Abelian groups with respect to the Word-RAM computational model.</description>
