      <title>Can spinodal decomposition occur during decompression-induced vesiculation of magma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volcanic eruptions are driven by decompression-induced vesiculation of volatiles in magma. Its initial phase has long been described as nucleation. Recently, it was proposed that spinodal decomposition (SD; an energetically spontaneous phase separation without forming a distinct interface) may occur during magma vesiculation. This suggestion is currently based only on qualitative textural observations of the products of decompression experiments. In this study, I used a simple thermodynamic approach to quantitatively investigate whether SD can occur during magma vesiculation. Using the previous water solubility data, I plotted the binodal and spinodal curves on the chemical composition-pressure plane for several hydrous magmas, treating them as two-component symmetric regular solutions of silicate and water. The spinodal curves were much lower than the binodal curves at pressures sufficiently below the second critical endpoints. In addition, the final pressure of all the decompression experiments performed to date fell between these two curves. This suggests that SD is unlikely to occur in the pressure range of magmatic processes in the continental crust or at realistic decompression rates i.e. magma vesiculation results from nucleation, as previously suggested. To test this thermodynamic approach, I estimated the microscopic surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus in previous decompression experiments by substituting the spinodal pressure into the nonclassical nucleation theory (non-CNT) equation for the dependence of the surface tension on the degree of supersaturation. The resulting values were significantly more scattered than those obtained by the conventional method: inversion of the experimental bubble number density using the classical nucleation theory (CNT) formula. Thus, it is difficult to judge whether the non-CNT equation is appropriate for magma systems.</description>

      <title>Insights on the dip of fault zones in Southern California from modeling of seismicity with anisotropic point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate models of fault zone geometry are important for scientific and hazard applications. While seismicity can provide high-resolution point measurements of fault geometry, extrapolating these measurements to volumes may involve making strong assumptions. This is particularly problematic in distributed fault zones, which are commonly observed in immature faulting regions. In this study, we focus on characterizing the dip of fault zones in Southern California with the goal of improving fault models. We introduce a novel technique from spatial point process theory to quantify the orientation of persistent surficial features in seismicity, even when embedded in wide shear zones. The technique makes relatively mild assumptions about fault geometry and is formulated with the goal of determining the dip of a fault zone at depth. The method is applied to 11 prominent seismicity regions in Southern California. Overall, the results compare favorably with the geometry models provided by the SCEC Community Fault Model and other focused regional studies. More specifically, we find evidence that the Southern San Andreas and San Jacinto fault zones are both northeast dipping at seismogenic depths at the length scales of 1.0-4.0 km. In addition, we find more limited evidence for some depth dependent variations in dip that suggest a listric geometry. The developed technique can provide an independent source of information from seismicity to augment existing fault geometry models.</description>

      <title>A multi-step calibration strategy for reliable parameter determination of salt rock mechanics constitutive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable hydrogen storage in salt caverns requires fast injection and production rates to cope with the imbalance between energy production and consumption. Such operational conditions raise concerns about the mechanical stability of salt caverns. Choosing an appropriate constitutive model for salt mechanics is an important step in investigating this issue, and many constitutive models with several parameters have been presented in the literature. However, a robust calibration strategy to reliably determine which model and which parameter set represent the given rock, based on stress-strain data, remains an unsolved challenge. For the first time in the community, we present a multi-step strategy to determine a single parameter set based on many deformation datasets for salt rocks. Towards this end, we first develop a comprehensive constitutive model able to capture all relevant nonlinear deformation physics of transient, reverse, and steady-state creep. The determination of the single set of representative material parameters is achieved by framing the calibration process as an optimization problem, for which the global PSO algorithm is employed. Dynamic data integration is achieved by a multi-step calibration strategy for a situation where experiments are included one at a time, as they become available. Additionally, our calibration strategy is made flexible to account for mild heterogeneity between rock samples, resulting in a single set of parameters that is representative of the deformation datasets. As a rigorous mathematical analysis and the lack of relevant experimental datasets, we consider a wide range of synthetic experimental data, inspired by the existing sparse relevant data in the literature. The results of our performance analyses show that the proposed calibration strategy is robust and accuracy is improved as more experiments are included for calibration.</description>

      <title>GAN-supervised Seismic Data Reconstruction: An Enhanced-Learning for Improved Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic data interpolation of irregularly missing traces plays a crucial role in subsurface imaging, enabling accurate analysis and interpretation throughout the seismic processing workflow. Despite the widespread exploration of deep supervised learning methods for seismic data reconstruction, several challenges still remain open. Particularly, the requirement of extensive training data and poor domain generalization due to the seismic survey's variability poses significant issues. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep-learning-based seismic data reconstruction approach that leverages data redundancy. This method involves a two-stage training process. First, an adversarial generative network (GAN) is trained using synthetic seismic data, enabling the extraction and learning of their primary and local seismic characteristics. Second, a reconstruction network is trained with synthetic data generated by the GAN, which dynamically adjusts the noise and distortion level at each epoch to promote feature diversity. This approach enhances the generalization capabilities of the reconstruction network by allowing control over the generation of seismic patterns from the latent space of the GAN, thereby reducing the dependency on large seismic databases. Experimental results on field and synthetic seismic datasets both pre-stack and post-stack show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline supervised learning and unsupervised approaches such as deep seismic prior and internal learning, by up to 8 dB of PSNR.</description>

      <title>Note on Using Singular Value Decomposition to Solve for Single-Phase Flow and Identify Isolated Clusters in Heterogeneous Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diluted pore networks or networks that are obtained directly from image analysis are commonly used to evaluate flow through complex porous media. These networks are often subjected to singular points and regions, that is, isolated sub-networks that are not connecting the inlet and outlet. These regions impair the invertibility of the modified Laplacian matrix and affect the accuracy and robustness of pore network models. Searching and eliminating these singularities is commonly done by preconditioning or searching algorithms like breadth-first search or depth-first search. Here, we propose using singular value decomposition (SVD) to simultaneously solve for single-phase flow and locate isolated regions. We demonstrate the performance of the method for networks obtained from images of a partially saturated medium, and for diluted networks close to the percolation threshold.</description>

      <title>Basal force fluctuations and granular rheology: Linking macroscopic descriptions of granular flows to bed forces with implications for monitoring signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Granular flows are ubiquitous in nature with single flows traversing a wide range of dynamic conditions from initiation to deposition. Many of these flows are responsible for significant hazards and have the ability to generate remotely detectable seismic signals. These signals provide a potential for real-time flow measurements from a safe distance. To fully realize the benefit of seismic measurements, basal granular forces must be linked to macroscopic internal flow dynamics across a wide range of flow conditions. We utilize discrete element simulations to observe dry and submerged granular flows under plane-shear and inclined flow configurations, relating bulk kinematics to basal force distributions. We find that force fluctuations scale with non-dimensional shear-rate ($I$), and this scaling tracks three flow regimes that can be described by $\mu(I)$ rheology, as well as a fourth regime that marks a `phase change' from a liquid-like to a gas-like state: (1) an unsteady particle rearrangement regime when $I&lt;10^{-3}$, where basal forces are dominated by low frequencies; (2) an intermediate regime when $10^{-3}&lt; I&lt;10^{-2}$, where basal forces start to become noise-like, (3) a transitional regime at $10^{-2}&lt;I&lt;10^{-1}$, where the increase in basal tractions with increasing shear-rates stalls as the granular bed dilates, partially destroying the contact network and memory stored in the particle contact network, and (4) a fully collisional regime when $I&gt;10^{-1}$, where the signal is nearly flat up to a cutoff frequency. This effort suggests that basal forces can be used to interpret complex granular processes in geophysical flows.</description>
