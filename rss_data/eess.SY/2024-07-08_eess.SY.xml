      <title>C-ShipGen: A Conditional Guided Diffusion Model for Parametric Ship Hull Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ship design is a complex design process that may take a team of naval architects many years to complete. Improving the ship design process can lead to significant cost savings, while still delivering high-quality designs to customers. A new technology for ship hull design is diffusion models, a type of generative artificial intelligence. Prior work with diffusion models for ship hull design created high-quality ship hulls with reduced drag and larger displaced volumes. However, the work could not generate hulls that meet specific design constraints. This paper proposes a conditional diffusion model that generates hull designs given specific constraints, such as the desired principal dimensions of the hull. In addition, this diffusion model leverages the gradients from a total resistance regression model to create low-resistance designs. Five design test cases compared the diffusion model to a design optimization algorithm to create hull designs with low resistance. In all five test cases, the diffusion model was shown to create diverse designs with a total resistance less than the optimized hull, having resistance reductions over 25%. The diffusion model also generated these designs without retraining. This work can significantly reduce the design cycle time of ships by creating high-quality hulls that meet user requirements with a data-driven approach.</description>

      <title>Predict. Optimize. Revise. On Forecast and Policy Stability in Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Poroelastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework designed to model coupled-field problems specifically tailored for heterogeneous poroelastic media. Firstly, a composite neural network is developed where distinct neural networks are dedicated to predicting displacement and pressure variables for each material, employing identical activation functions but trained separately across all other parameters. Secondly, we handle the challenges of heterogeneous material interfaces by the Interface- PINNs (I-PINNs) framework, where different activation functions across any material interface are prescribed to ensure that the discontinuities in solution fields and gradients are accurately captured. We compare the modified PINNs framework with the conventional approach on two one-dimensional benchmark examples for poroelasticity in heterogeneous media. Furthermore, we assess a single neural network architecture, comparing it against the composite neural network proposed in this work. These examples show that the proposed framework demonstrates superior approximation accuracy in both displacements and pressures, and better convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Analytical Gradient and Hessian Evaluation for System Identification using State-Parameter Transition Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Einstein notation is utilized to synthesize state and parameter transition matrices, by solving a set of ordinary differential equations. Additionally, for the system identification problem, it has been demonstrated that the gradient and Hessian of a cost function can be analytically constructed using the same matrix and tensor metrics. A general gradientbased optimization problem is then posed to identify unknown system parameters and unknown initial conditions. Here, the analytical gradient and Hessian of the cost function are derived using these state and parameter transition matrices. The more robust performance of the proposed method for identifying unknown system parameters and unknown initial conditions over an existing conventional quasi-Newton method-based system identification toolbox (available in MATLAB) is demonstrated by using two widely used benchmark datasets from real dynamic systems. In the existing toolbox, gradient and Hessian information, which are derived using a finite difference method, are more susceptible to numerical errors compared to the analytical approach presented.
  Keywords: Gradient-based Optimization, Transition matrix and tensors, Gradient and Hessian, System identification.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal cooperative control Method of Highway Ramp Merge Based on Vehicle-road Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merging area of highway ramps faces multiple challenges, including traffic congestion, collision risks, speed mismatches, driver behavior uncertainties, limited visibility, and bottleneck effects. However, autonomous vehicles engaging in depth coordination between vehicle and road in merging zones, by pre-planning and uploading travel trajectories, can significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of merging zones.In this paper,we mainly introduce mainline priority cooperation method to achieve the time and space cooperative control of highway merge.Vehicle-mounted intelligent units share real-time vehicle status and driving intentions with Road Section Management Units, which pre-plan the spatiotemporal trajectories of vehicle travel. After receiving these trajectories, Vehicle Intelligent Units strictly adhere to them. Through this deep collaboration between vehicles and roads, conflicts in time and space during vehicle travel are eliminated in advance.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Free Coordinated Dispatch of Microgrid: A Data-Driven Online Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into microgrids poses challenges to reliable and economic operation due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility of RES. Contrary to the previous dispatch methods that require precise predictions of RES, this paper proposes a novel prediction-free and data-driven coordinated dispatch framework for reliable microgrid operations. In the offline stage, ex-post optimal dispatch sequences are generated based on historical dispatch from "God' s-eye view". The sequences offer a global reference and are sequentially updated based on the newly observed data. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive virtual-queue-based online convex optimization (OCO) method to generate the real-time control policy of microgrid, which aim to minimize the instant operation cost while tracking the offline reference. We provide theoretical proof that the proposed method outperforms the existing OCO methods and admits sublinear dynamic regret bound and sublinear hard cumulative constraint violation bound for OCO with time-varying constraints. Case study illustrates that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of economic optimality, computational efficiency, and security.</description>

      <title>BasisN: Reprogramming-Free RRAM-Based In-Memory-Computing by Basis Combination for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made breakthroughs in various fields including image recognition and language processing. DNNs execute hundreds of millions of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. To efficiently accelerate such computations, analog in-memory-computing platforms have emerged leveraging emerging devices such as resistive RAM (RRAM). However, such accelerators face the hurdle of being required to have sufficient on-chip crossbars to hold all the weights of a DNN. Otherwise, RRAM cells in the crossbars need to be reprogramed to process further layers, which causes huge time/energy overhead due to the extremely slow writing and verification of the RRAM cells. As a result, it is still not possible to deploy such accelerators to process large-scale DNNs in industry. To address this problem, we propose the BasisN framework to accelerate DNNs on any number of available crossbars without reprogramming. BasisN introduces a novel representation of the kernels in DNN layers as combinations of global basis vectors shared between all layers with quantized coefficients. These basis vectors are written to crossbars only once and used for the computations of all layers with marginal hardware modification. BasisN also provides a novel training approach to enhance computation parallelization with the global basis vectors and optimize the coefficients to construct the kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that cycles per inference and energy-delay product were reduced to below 1% compared with applying reprogramming on crossbars in processing large-scale DNNs such as DenseNet and ResNet on ImageNet and CIFAR100 datasets, while the training and hardware costs are negligible.</description>

      <title>Automated C/C++ Program Repair for High-Level Synthesis via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In High-Level Synthesis (HLS), converting a regular C/C++ program into its HLS-compatible counterpart (HLS-C) still requires tremendous manual effort. Various program scripts have been introduced to automate this process. But the resulting codes usually contain many issues that should be manually repaired by developers. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automate code generation, they can also be used for automated program repair in HLS. However, due to the limited training of LLMs considering hardware and software simultaneously, hallucinations may occur during program repair using LLMs, leading to compilation failures. Besides, using LLMs for iterative repair also incurs a high cost. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-driven program repair framework that takes regular C/C++ code as input and automatically generates its corresponding HLS-C code for synthesis while minimizing human repair effort. To mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs and enhance the prompt quality, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm is introduced to guide the LLMs toward correct repair. In addition, we use LLMs to create a static bit width optimization program to identify the optimized bit widths for variables. Moreover, LLM-driven HLS optimization strategies are introduced to add/tune pragmas in HLS-C programs for circuit optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-driven automated framework can achieve much higher repair pass rates in 24 real-world applications compared with the traditional scripts and the direct application of LLMs for program repair.</description>

      <title>Specification-guided temporal logic control for stochastic systems: a multi-layered approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers to satisfy temporal requirements has proven to be challenging for dynamical systems that are affected by uncertainty. This is mainly due to the states evolving in a continuous uncountable space, the stochastic evolution of the states, and infinite-horizon temporal requirements on the system evolution, all of which makes closed-form solutions generally inaccessible. A promising approach for designing provably correct controllers on such systems is to utilize the concept of abstraction, which is based on building simplified abstract models that can be used to approximate optimal controllers with provable closeness guarantees. The available abstraction-based methods are further divided into discretization-based approaches that build a finite abstract model by discretizing the continuous space of the system, and discretization-free approaches that work directly on the continuous state space without the need for building a finite space. To reduce the conservatism in the sub-optimality of the designed controller originating from the abstraction step, this paper develops an approach that naturally has the flexibility to combine different abstraction techniques from the aforementioned classes and to combine the same abstraction technique with different parameters. First, we develop a multi-layered discretization-based approach with variable precision by combining abstraction layers with different precision parameters. Then, we exploit the advantages of both classes of abstraction-based methods by extending this multi-layered approach guided by the specification to combinations of layers with respectively discretization-based and discretization-free abstractions. We achieve an efficient implementation that is less conservative and improves the computation time and memory usage. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed multi-layered approach on several case studies.</description>

      <title>Configuring Transmission Thresholds in IIoT Alarm Scenarios for Energy-Efficient Event Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications involve real-time monitoring, detection, and data analysis. This is challenged by the intermittent activity of IIoT devices (IIoTDs) and their limited battery capacity. Indeed, the former issue makes resource scheduling and random access difficult, while the latter constrains IIoTDs' lifetime and efficient operation. In this paper, we address interconnected aspects of these issues. Specifically, we focus on extending the battery life of IIoTDs sensing events/alarms by minimizing the number of unnecessary transmissions. Note that when multiple devices access the channel simultaneously, there are collisions, potentially leading to retransmissions, thus reducing energy efficiency. We propose a threshold-based transmission-decision policy based on the sensing quality and the network spatial deployment. We optimize the transmission thresholds using several approaches such as successive convex approximation, block coordinate descent methods, Voronoi diagrams, explainable machine learning, and algorithms based on natural selection and social behavior. Besides, we propose a new approach that reformulates the optimization problem as a $Q$-learning solution to promote adaptability to system dynamics. Through numerical evaluation, we demonstrate significant performance enhancements in complex IIoT environments, thus validating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed solutions. We show that Q-learning performs the best, while the block coordinate descending method incurs the worst performance. Additionally, we compare the proposed methods with a benchmark assigning the same threshold to all the devices for transmission decision. Compared to the benchmark, up to 94\% and 60\% reduction in power consumption are achieved in low-density and high-density scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to overapproximate forward stochastic reach sets of discrete-time, stochastic nonlinear systems with interval geometry. This is made possible by extending the theory of mixed-monotone systems to incorporate stochastic orders, and a concentration inequality result that lower-bounds the probability the state resides within an interval through a monotone mapping. Then, we present an algorithm to compute the overapproximations of forward reachable set and the probability the state resides within it. We present our approach on two aerospace examples to show its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Enabling Multicast Transmission for Spatio-Temporally Asynchronous User Requests in Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in wireless devices and data traffic volume necessitates more efficient transmission methods. Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</description>

      <title>A Complex-Coefficient Voltage Control for Virtual Synchronous Generators for Dynamic Enhancement and Power-Voltage Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As electric power systems evolve towards decarbonization, the transition to inverter-based resources (IBRs) presents challenges to grid stability, necessitating innovative control solutions. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) emerges as a prominent solution. However, conventional VSGs are prone to instability in strong grids, slow voltage regulation, and coupled power-voltage response. To address these issues, this paper introduces an advanced VSG control strategy. A novel analysis of the VSG control dynamics is presented through a second-order closed-loop complex single-input single-output system, employing a vectorized geometrical pole analysis technique for enhanced voltage stability and dynamics. The proposed comprehensive controller design mitigates issues related to control interacted subsynchronous resonance and $dq \leftrightarrow 3\phi$ transformation-induced voltage-coupled power transients, achieving improved system robustness and simplified control tuning. Key contributions include a two-fold design: optimized voltage transition characteristics through direct pole placement and transient power overshoot correction via a compensator. Validated by simulation and experiments, the findings offer a pragmatic solution for integrating VSG technology into decarbonizing power systems, ensuring reliability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>LFT modelling and $\mu$-based robust performance analysis of hybrid multi-rate control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on robust stability and $H_\infty$ performance analyses of hybrid continuous/discrete time linear multi-rate control systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties. These affect the continuous-time plant in a rational way which is then modeled as a Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT). Based on a zero-order-hold (ZOH) LFT discretization process at the cost of bounded quantifiable approximations, and then using LFT-preserving down-sampling operations, a single-rate discrete-time closed-loop LFT model is derived. Interestingly, for any step inputs, and any admissible values of the uncertain parameters, the outputs of this model cover those of the initial hybrid multi-rate closed-loop system at every sampling time of the slowest control loop. Such an LFT model, which also captures the discretization errors, can then be used to evaluate both robust stability and guaranteed $H_\infty$ performance with a $\mu$-based approach. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a realistic and easily reproducible example inspired by the validation of multi-rate attitude control systems.</description>

      <title>Balancing Operator's Risk Averseness in Model Predictive Control of a Reservoir System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control strategy suited for flood control of water resources infrastructure. Despite many studies on reservoir flood control and their theoretical contribution, optimisation methodologies have not been widely applied in real-time operation due to disparities between research assumptions and practical requirements. First, tacit objectives such as minimising the magnitude and frequency of changes in the existing outflow schedule are considered important in practice, but these are nonlinear and challenging to formulate to suit all conditions. Incorporating these objectives transforms the problem into a multi-objective nonlinear optimisation problem that is difficult to solve online. Second, it is reasonable to assume that the weights and parameters are not stationary because the preference varies depending on the state of the system. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that converts the original intractable problem into parameterized linear MPC problems with dynamic optimisation of weights and parameters. This is done by introducing a model-based learning concept under the assumption of the dynamic nature of the operator's preference. We refer to this framework as Parameterised Dynamic MPC (PD-MPC). The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a numerical experiment for the Daecheong multipurpose reservoir in South Korea. We find that PD-MPC outperforms `standard' MPC-based designs without a dynamic optimisation process under the same uncertain inflows.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Waveform Generated Metasurface: A New Paradigm for Direct Modulation and Beamforming Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04544v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) are especially important in a variety of fields like radar detection, wireless communications and integrated sensing and communications. Typically, backscatter devices are used to achieve passive signal reflection modulation to facilitate information transmission or to interfere with radar echoes. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) or Metasurface is a promising technology that combines the advantages of backscatter devices and reflective array antennas. Previous studies demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve reflection modulation by utilizing the superposition of the quantified reflective coefficient (RC) of each unit but suffer from the computing complexity of codebook sequence, the safety of communication, and the flexibility of modulation. To overcome the difficulties, we propose new paradigm of metasurface, i.e. AWG-RIS, that can independently generate arbitrary baseband waveforms and beam patterns based on a magnitude-phase decoupled unit design without altering the beam pattern. We proposed an analysis framework and introduce waveform factor and beamforming factor into the new model which provide the theoretical support for the flow from the control signal to the outgoing electromagnetic wave. Furthermore, we introduce the world's first prototype that demonstrates passive arbitrary waveform generation without altering the beam pattern. The experiments validate the generation of arbitrary waveforms and spectrograms, both for a single input and through the superposition of multiple inputs.</description>

      <title>Suitability of Common Ingestible Antennas for Multiplexed Gastrointestinal Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ingestible sensor devices, which are increasingly used for internal health monitoring, rely on antennas to perform sensing functions and simultaneously to communicate with external devices. Despite the development of various ingestible antennas, there has been no comprehensive comparison of their performance as biosensors. This paper addresses this gap by examining and comparing the suitability of three common types of ingestible antennas -- dipole, patch, and loop -- as biosensors for distinguishing gastrointestinal tissues (stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) based on their electromagnetic properties. The antennas studied in this work conform to the inner surface of biocompatible polylactic acid capsules with varying shell thicknesses and operate in the 433 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band. The comparison is performed in gastrointestinal tissues using several antenna parameters: 1) Sensing Capability: Changes in the phase of the reflection coefficient in the tissues are selected as the sensing parameter. 2) Robustness: The frequency interval (f_i) in which the antennas are matched (|S11| &lt; -10 dB) in all the tissues and the maximum change in the center frequency (f_c) in different tissues are examined. 3) Radiation Performance: The gain and radiation efficiency of the antennas are examined. The effect of shell thickness on gain and radiation efficiency at 434 MHz is presented. Additionally, the radiation efficiency at various frequencies allocated for medical communications is compared with the theoretical maximum achievable efficiencies. These comprehensive data provide valuable information for making engineering decisions when designing multiplexed biosensor antennas for ingestible applications.</description>

      <title>An Outline of Prognostics and Health Management Large Model: Concepts, Paradigms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prognosis and Health Management (PHM), critical for ensuring task completion by complex systems and preventing unexpected failures, is widely adopted in aerospace, manufacturing, maritime, rail, energy, etc. However, PHM's development is constrained by bottlenecks like generalization, interpretation and verification abilities. Presently, generative artificial intelligence (AI), represented by Large Model, heralds a technological revolution with the potential to fundamentally reshape traditional technological fields and human production methods. Its capabilities, including strong generalization, reasoning, and generative attributes, present opportunities to address PHM's bottlenecks. To this end, based on a systematic analysis of the current challenges and bottlenecks in PHM, as well as the research status and advantages of Large Model, we propose a novel concept and three progressive paradigms of Prognosis and Health Management Large Model (PHM-LM) through the integration of the Large Model with PHM. Subsequently, we provide feasible technical approaches for PHM-LM to bolster PHM's core capabilities within the framework of the three paradigms. Moreover, to address core issues confronting PHM, we discuss a series of technical challenges of PHM-LM throughout the entire process of construction and application. This comprehensive effort offers a holistic PHM-LM technical framework, and provides avenues for new PHM technologies, methodologies, tools, platforms and applications, which also potentially innovates design, research &amp; development, verification and application mode of PHM. And furthermore, a new generation of PHM with AI will also capably be realized, i.e., from custom to generalized, from discriminative to generative, and from theoretical conditions to practical applications.</description>

      <title>Passenger Route and Departure Time Guidance under Disruptions in Oversaturated Urban Rail Transit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urban rail transit (URT) system attracts many commuters with its punctuality and convenience. However, it is vulnerable to disruptions caused by factors like extreme weather and temporary equipment failures, which greatly impact passengers' journeys and diminish the system's service quality. In this study, we propose targeted travel guidance for passengers at different space-time locations by devising passenger rescheduling strategies during disruptions. This guidance not only offers insights into route changes but also provides practical recommendations for delaying departure times when required. We present a novel three-feature four-group passenger classification principle, integrating temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal features to classify passengers in disrupted URT networks. This approach results in the creation of four distinct solution spaces based on passenger groups. A mixed integer programming model is built based on individual level considering the First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule in oversaturated networks. Additionally, we present a two-stage solution approach for handling the complex issues in large-scale networks. Experimental results from both small-scale artificial networks and the real-world Beijing URT network validate the efficacy of our proposed passenger rescheduling strategies in mitigating disruptions. Specifically, when compared to scenarios with no travel guidance during disruptions, our strategies achieve a substantial reduction in total passenger travel time by 29.7% and 50.9% respectively, underscoring the effectiveness in managing unexpected disruptions.</description>

      <title>Reliable Projection Based Unsupervised Learning for Semi-Definite QCQP with Application of Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a special class of quadratic-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) with semi-definite constraints. Traditionally, since such a problem is non-convex and N-hard, the neural network (NN) is regarded as a promising method to obtain a high-performing solution. However, due to the inherent prediction error, it is challenging to ensure all solution output by the NN is feasible. Although some existing methods propose some naive methods, they only focus on reducing the constraint violation probability, where not all solutions are feasibly guaranteed. To deal with the above challenge, in this paper a computing efficient and reliable projection is proposed, where all solution output by the NN are ensured to be feasible. Moreover, unsupervised learning is used, so the NN can be trained effectively and efficiently without labels. Theoretically, the solution of the NN after projection is proven to be feasible, and we also prove the projection method can enhance the convergence performance and speed of the NN. To evaluate our proposed method, the quality of service (QoS)-contained beamforming scenario is studied, where the simulation results show the proposed method can achieve high-performance which is competitive with the lower bound.</description>

      <title>Robust Affine Formation Control of Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine formation control is a subset of formation control methods, which has gained increasing popularity for its flexibility and maneuverability in diverse applications. Affine formation control is inherently distributed in nature, where the local controllers onboard each agent are linearly dependent on the relative position measurements of the neighboring agents. The unavailability of these measurements in practice, due to node failure or missing links, leads to a change in the underlying graph topology, and subsequently causes instability and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an estimation framework to enhance the robustness of distributed affine formation control systems against these topology changes. Our estimation framework features an adaptive fusion of both temporal information from the dynamics of agents and spatial information which is derived from the geometry of the affine formations. We propose a suite of algorithms under this framework to tackle various practical scenarios, and numerically verify our proposed estimator on stability, convergence rate, and optimality criterion. Simulations show the performance of our proposed algorithms as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and we summarize them with future research directions.</description>

      <title>TwinLab: a framework for data-efficient training of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Simulation-based digital twins represent an effort to provide high-accuracy real-time insights into operational physical processes. However, the computation time of many multi-physical simulation models is far from real-time. It might even exceed sensible time frames to produce sufficient data for training data-driven reduced-order models. This study presents TwinLab, a framework for data-efficient, yet accurate training of neural-ODE type reduced-order models with only two data sets. Design/methodology/approach: Correlations between test errors of reduced-order models and distinct features of corresponding training data are investigated. Having found the single best data sets for training, a second data set is sought with the help of similarity and error measures to enrich the training process effectively. Findings: Adding a suitable second training data set in the training process reduces the test error by up to 49% compared to the best base reduced-order model trained only with one data set. Such a second training data set should at least yield a good reduced-order model on its own and exhibit higher levels of dissimilarity to the base training data set regarding the respective excitation signal. Moreover, the base reduced-order model should have elevated test errors on the second data set. The relative error of the time series ranges from 0.18% to 0.49%. Prediction speed-ups of up to a factor of 36,000 are observed. Originality: The proposed computational framework facilitates the automated, data-efficient extraction of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital twins from existing simulation models, independent of the simulation software.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>EAGERx: Graph-Based Framework for Sim2real Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sim2real, that is, the transfer of learned control policies from simulation to real world, is an area of growing interest in robotics due to its potential to efficiently handle complex tasks. The sim2real approach faces challenges due to mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from inaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among other factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified software pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support various simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale abstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx's integrated delay simulation, domain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm contribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of robot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse robotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior. EAGERx is open source and its code is available at https://eagerx.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faced with a dangerous epidemic humans will spontaneously social distance to reduce their risk of infection at a socio-economic cost. Compartmentalised epidemic models have been extended to include this endogenous decision making: Individuals choose their behaviour to optimise a utility function, self-consistently giving rise to population behaviour. Here we study the properties of the resulting Nash equilibria, in which no member of the population can gain an advantage by unilaterally adopting different behaviour. We leverage a new analytic solution to obtain, (1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behaviour and the current number of infections; (2) new scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; (3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioural response and depend only on the basic reproduction number of the disease; (4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility. We discuss how these analytic results provide a deep and intuitive understanding into the disease dynamics, useful for both individuals and policymakers. In particular the relationship between social distancing and infections represents a heuristic that could be communicated to the population to encourage, or "bootstrap", rational behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic behaviour of a power system can be described by a system of differential-algebraic equations. Time-domain simulations are used to simulate the evolution of these dynamics. They often require the use of small time step sizes and therefore become computationally expensive. To accelerate these simulations, we propose a simulator - PINNSim - that allows to take significantly larger time steps. It is based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the solution of the dynamics of single components in the power system. To resolve their interaction we employ a scalable root-finding algorithm. We demonstrate PINNSim on a 9-bus system and show the increased time step size compared to a trapezoidal integration rule. We discuss key characteristics of PINNSim and important steps for developing PINNSim into a fully fledged simulator. As such, it could offer the opportunity for significantly increasing time step sizes and thereby accelerating time-domain simulations.</description>

      <title>Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially to move freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity on the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>A Stiffness-Oriented Model Order Reduction Method for Low-Inertia Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel model order reduction technique tailored for power systems with a large share of inverter-based energy resources. Such systems exhibit an increased level of dynamic stiffness compared to traditional power systems, posing challenges for time-domain simulations and control design. Our approach involves rotation of the coordinate system of a linearized system using a transformation matrix derived from the real Jordan canonical form, leading to mode decoupling. The fast modes are then truncated in the rotated coordinate system to obtain a lower-order model with reduced stiffness. Applying the same transformation to the original nonlinear system results in an approximate separation of slow and fast states, which can be truncated to reduce the stiffness. The resulting reduced-order model demonstrates an accurate time-domain performance, the slow eigenvalues of the linearized system are correctly preserved, and a reduction in the model stiffness is achieved, allowing for accurate integration with increased step size. Our methodology is assessed in detail for a 3-bus system with generation units involving grid-forming/following converters and synchronous machines, where it allows for a computational speed-up of up to 100x compared to the original system. Several standard larger test systems are also considered.</description>

      <title>Learning flow functions of spiking systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for surrogate modelling of spiking systems. These systems are often described by stiff differential equations with high-amplitude oscillations and multi-timescale dynamics, making surrogate models an attractive tool for system design and simulation. We parameterise the flow function of a spiking system using a recurrent neural network architecture, allowing for a direct continuous-time representation of the state trajectories. The spiking nature of the signals makes for a data-heavy and computationally hard training process; thus, we describe two methods to mitigate these difficulties. We demonstrate our framework on two conductance-based models of biological neurons, showing that we are able to train surrogate models which accurately replicate the spiking behaviour.</description>

      <title>Augmented Labeled Random Finite Sets and Its Application to Group Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of group target tracking (GTT), wherein multiple closely spaced targets within a group pose a coordinated motion. To improve the tracking performance, the labeled random finite sets (LRFSs) theory is adopted, and this paper develops a new kind of LRFSs, i.e., augmented LRFSs, which introduces group information into the definition of LRFSs. Specifically, for each element in an LRFS, the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of its represented target are incorporated. Furthermore, by means of the labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs, the group structure is iteratively propagated and updated during the tracking process, which achieves the simultaneously estimation of the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of multiple group targets, and further improves the GTT tracking performance. Finally, simulation experiments are provided, which well demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeled multi-Bernoulli filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs for GTT tracking.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Control for Safety Under Input Constraints Using a Composition of Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a closed-form optimal control that satisfies both safety constraints (i.e., state constraints) and input constraints (e.g., actuator limits) using a composition of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs). This main contribution is obtained through the combination of several ideas. First, we present a method for constructing a single relaxed control barrier function (R-CBF) from multiple CBFs, which can have different relative degrees. The construction relies on a log-sum-exponential soft-minimum function and yields an R-CBF whose zero-superlevel set is a subset of the intersection of the zero-superlevel sets of all CBFs used in the composition. Next, we use the soft-minimum R-CBF to construct a closed-form control that is optimal with respect to a quadratic cost subject to the safety constraints. Finally, we use the soft-minimum R-CBF to develop a closed-form optimal control that not only guarantees safety but also respects input constraints. The key elements in developing this novel control include: the introduction of the control dynamics, which allow the input constraints to be transformed into controller-state constraints; the use of the soft-minimum R-CBF to compose multiple safety and input CBFs, which have different relative degrees; and the development of a desired surrogate control (i.e., a desired input to the control dynamics). We demonstrate these new control approaches in simulation on a nonholonomic ground robot.</description>

      <title>Exact Instability Radius of Discrete-Time LTI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robust instability of an unstable plant subject to stable perturbations is of significant importance and arises in the study of sustained oscillatory phenomena in nonlinear systems. This paper analyzes the robust instability of linear discrete-time systems against stable perturbations via the notion of robust instability radius (RIR) as a measure of instability. We determine the exact RIR for certain unstable systems using small-gain type conditions by formulating the problem in terms of a phase change rate maximization subject to appropriate constraints at unique peak-gain frequencies, for which stable first-order all-pass functions are shown to be optimal. Two real-world applications -- minimum-effort sampled-data control of magnetic levitation systems and neural spike generations in the FitzHugh--Nagumo model subject to perturbations -- are provided to illustrate the utility of our results.</description>

      <title>Learning Decentralized Linear Quadratic Regulators with $\sqrt{T}$ Regret</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an online learning algorithm that adaptively designs a decentralized linear quadratic regulator when the system model is unknown a priori and new data samples from a single system trajectory become progressively available. The algorithm uses a disturbance-feedback representation of state-feedback controllers coupled with online convex optimization with memory and delayed feedback. Under the assumption that the system is stable or given a known stabilizing controller, we show that our controller enjoys an expected regret that scales as $\sqrt{T}$ with the time horizon $T$ for the case of partially nested information pattern. For more general information patterns, the optimal controller is unknown even if the system model is known. In this case, the regret of our controller is shown with respect to a linear sub-optimal controller. We validate our theoretical findings using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Robust Pivoting Manipulation using Contact Implicit Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizable manipulation requires that robots be able to interact with novel objects and environment. This requirement makes manipulation extremely challenging as a robot has to reason about complex frictional interactions with uncertainty in physical properties of the object and the environment. In this paper, we study robust optimization for planning of pivoting manipulation in the presence of uncertainties. We present insights about how friction can be exploited to compensate for inaccuracies in the estimates of the physical properties during manipulation. Under certain assumptions, we derive analytical expressions for stability margin provided by friction during pivoting manipulation. This margin is then used in a Contact Implicit Bilevel Optimization (CIBO) framework to optimize a trajectory that maximizes this stability margin to provide robustness against uncertainty in several physical parameters of the object. We present analysis of the stability margin with respect to several parameters involved in the underlying bilevel optimization problem. We demonstrate our proposed method using a 6 DoF manipulator for manipulating several different objects. We also design and validate an MPC controller using the proposed algorithm which can track and regulate the position of the object during manipulation.</description>

      <title>DiffTune-MPC: Closed-Loop Learning for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has been applied to many platforms in robotics and autonomous systems for its capability to predict a system's future behavior while incorporating constraints that a system may have. To enhance the performance of a system with an MPC controller, one can manually tune the MPC's cost function. However, it can be challenging due to the possibly high dimension of the parameter space as well as the potential difference between the open-loop cost function in MPC and the overall closed-loop performance metric function. This paper presents DiffTune-MPC, a novel learning method, to learn the cost function of an MPC in a closed-loop manner. The proposed framework is compatible with the scenario where the time interval for performance evaluation and MPC's planning horizon have different lengths. We show the auxiliary problem whose solution admits the analytical gradients of MPC and discuss its variations in different MPC settings, including nonlinear MPCs that are solved using sequential quadratic programming. Simulation results demonstrate the learning capability of DiffTune-MPC and the generalization capability of the learned MPC parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this correspondence, we propose a joint mechanical and electrical adjustment of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for the performance improvements of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. In particular, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) MIMO channel model for the mechanically-tilted IRS in general deployment, and consider two types of scenarios with and without the direct path of LEO-ground user link due to the orbital flight. With the aim of maximizing the end-to-end performance, we jointly optimize tilting angle and phase shift of IRS along with the transceiver beamforming, whose performance superiority is verified via simulations with the Orbcomm LEO satellite using a real orbit data.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of affine-control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of affine-control systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result is crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically. We bring as a numerical example the Schr\"odinger equation for a qubit with uncertain resonance frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tie-knotting task is highly challenging due to the tie's high deformation and long-horizon manipulation actions. This work presents TieBot, a Real-to-Sim-to-Real learning from visual demonstration system for the robots to learn to knot a tie. We introduce the Hierarchical Feature Matching approach to estimate a sequence of tie's meshes from the demonstration video. With these estimated meshes used as subgoals, we first learn a teacher policy using privileged information. Then, we learn a student policy with point cloud observation by imitating teacher policy. Lastly, our pipeline learns a residual policy when the learned policy is applied to real-world execution, mitigating the Sim2Real gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TieBot in simulation and the real world. In the real-world experiment, a dual-arm robot successfully knots a tie, achieving 50% success rate among 10 trials.
