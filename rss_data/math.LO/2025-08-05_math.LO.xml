      <title>A free two-generated left distributive algebra of elementary embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set-theoretic large cardinal axiom known as I3 posits the existence of a non-trivial rank-to-rank embedding from an initial segment of the universe of sets into itself. Laver showed that the algebra generated by a single such embedding under the operation of application is in fact the free left distributive (LD) algebra on one generator. This and associated theorems using the set-theoretic structure of the embeddings yielded numerous results about general LD algebras under the assumption of I3, only some of which have since been proven without the use of such a strong axiom. A natural question is whether, under the assumption of I3, one can obtain a free LD algebra of embeddings on more than one generator. Here we show that, under an assumption only just above I3 in the large cardinal hierarchy (namely, I2), we indeed obtain a two-generated free left distributive algebra of rank-to-rank embeddings.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci Numbers and Model-Complete Axiomatization of Presburger Arithmetic Expanded with a Beatty Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a recursive theory that completely axiomatizes the structure $\langle \mathbb{Z},&lt;, +,f,0\rangle$ where $f$ is the function that maps each $x$ to the integer part of $\varphi x $, with $\varphi$ the golden ratio. We prove that our axiomatization is model-complete in a language expanded with a function which we call the Fibonacci floor function, as defined in the introduction. We also present an improvement of the axiomatization of the structure $\langle \mathbb{Z}, +, f,0\rangle$ already studied in [KZ22].</description>

      <title>The Derivative of a Constructible Function is Constructible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of constructible functions in the setting of tame real geometry has been introduced by Cluckers and Dan Miller in their work on parametric integration of globally subanalytic functions. A function on a globally subanalytic set is called constructible if it is a finite sum of finite products of globally subanalytic functions and the logarithm of positive globally subanalytic functions. We show that the class of constructible functions is stable under taking derivatives.</description>

      <title>Satisfaction is not absolute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0670</link>
      <description>arXiv:1312.0670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the satisfaction relation $\mathcal{N}\models\varphi[\vec a]$ of first-order logic is not absolute between models of set theory having the structure $\mathcal{N}$ and the formulas $\varphi$ all in common. Two models of set theory can have the same natural numbers, for example, and the same standard model of arithmetic $\langle\mathbb{N},{+},{\cdot},0,1,{\lt}\rangle$, yet disagree on their theories of arithmetic truth; two models of set theory can have the same natural numbers and the same arithmetic truths, yet disagree on their truths-about-truth, at any desired level of the iterated truth-predicate hierarchy; two models of set theory can have the same natural numbers and the same reals, yet disagree on projective truth; two models of set theory can have the same $\langle H_{\omega_2},{\in}\rangle$ or the same rank-initial segment $\langle V_\delta,{\in}\rangle$, yet disagree on which assertions are true in these structures.
  On the basis of these mathematical results, we argue that a philosophical commitment to the determinateness of the theory of truth for a structure cannot be seen as a consequence solely of the determinateness of the structure in which that truth resides. The determinate nature of arithmetic truth, for example, is not a consequence of the determinate nature of the arithmetic structure $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ itself, but rather, we argue, is an additional higher-order commitment requiring its own analysis and justification.</description>

      <title>Subseries Numbers for Convergent Subseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every conditionally convergent series of real numbers has a subseries that diverges. The subseries numbers, previously studied in arXiv:1801.06206 , answer the question how many subsets of the natural numbers are necessary, such that every conditionally convergent series has a subseries that diverges, with the index set being one of our chosen sets. By restricting our attention to subseries generated by an index set that is both infinite and coinfinite, we may ask the question where the subseries have to be convergent. The answer to this question is a cardinal characteristic of the continuum.
  We consider several closely related variations to this question, and show that our cardinal characteristics are related to several well-known cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In our investigation, we simultaneously will produce dual results, answering the question how many conditionally convergent series one needs such that no single infinite coinfinite set of indices makes all of the series converge.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of limit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of limit models assuming the existence of a nicely behaved independence notion. Under reasonable assumptions, we show that all `long' limit models are isomorphic, and all `short' limit models are non-isomorphic.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $\mathbf{K}$ be a $\aleph_0$-tame abstract elementary class stable in $\lambda \geq \operatorname{LS}(\mathbf{K})$ with amalgamation, joint embedding and no maximal models. Suppose there is an independence relation on the models of size $\lambda$ that satisfies uniqueness, extension, non-forking amalgamation, universal continuity, and $(\geq \kappa)$-local character in a minimal regular $\kappa &lt; \lambda^+$.
  Suppose $\delta_1, \delta_2 &lt; \lambda^+$ with $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) &lt; \operatorname{cf}(\delta_2)$. Then for any $N_1, N_2, M \in \mathbf{K}_\lambda$ where $N_l$ is a $(\lambda, \delta_l)$-limit model over $M$ for $l = 1, 2$,
  \[N_1 \text{ is isomorphic to } N_2 \text{ over } M \iff \operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) \geq \kappa\]
  Both implications in the conclusion have improvements. High cofinality limits are isomorphic without the $\aleph_0$-tameness assumption and assuming the independence relation is defined only on high cofinality limit models. Low cofinality limits are non-isomorphic without assuming non-forking amalgamation.
  We show how our results can be used to study limit models in both abstract settings and in natural examples of abstract elementary classes.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 3: strong regularity and the vertex partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here the strong regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. This type of regular decomposition comes with two components, a partition of the vertices, and a partition of the pairs of vertices. The data of a regular decomposition also includes two parameters measuring quasirandomness, a fixed constant $\epsilon_1&gt;0$, and a function $\epsilon_2:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow (0,1]$. We define two growth functions associated to a hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs: $T_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ which measures the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\epsilon_2)$ which measures the size of the pairs component. We introduce the following question. What are the possible asymptotic growth rates of functions of the form $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$? In this paper, we consider this question for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$, proving a separation into four classes: constant, polynomial, exponential, or at least wowzer. The separations among the constant, polynomial and exponential ranges require only slow growing (namely polynomial) choices for $\epsilon_2$. The jump to the wowzer range uses a very fast growing $\epsilon_2$ and makes crucial use of a lower bound construction for strong graph regularity due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 4: strong regularity and the pairs partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies bounds in a strong form of regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs which was developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. Regular decompositions of this type involve two structural components: a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. The regularity of such decompositions are measured by two parameters: an $\epsilon_1&gt;0$ and a function $\epsilon_2:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow (0,1]$. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ for the size of the pairs component. The problem of understanding the asymptotic growth of such functions was introduced in a companion paper, which also proved several results about $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. In this paper we study the possible asymptotic behavior of $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential. All results require only reasonable growth rates for $\epsilon_2$ (namely polynomial).</description>
