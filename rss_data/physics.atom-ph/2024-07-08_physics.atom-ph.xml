      <title>Interacting Circular Rydberg Atoms Trapped in Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular Rydberg atoms (CRAs), i.e., Rydberg atoms with maximal orbital momentum, ideally combine long coherence times and strong interactions, a key property of quantum systems, in particular for the development of quantum technologies. However, the dipole-dipole interaction between CRAs has not been observed so far. We report the measurement and characterization of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between two CRAs, individually trapped in optical tweezers, and find excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. We demonstrate a dynamic control over the strength of the interaction by tuning the orientation of an electric field. We use the interaction between the CRAs as a meter for the interatomic distance, and record the relative motion between two atoms in their traps. This motion, that we induce through the interaction between Rydberg levels with permanent electric dipoles, transiently populated during the preparation of the circular states, is a signature of spin-motion coupling.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Comparison of Two Thulium Optical Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental comparison of two thulium optical lattice clocks in a time interval of up to one hour has been carried out. The synchronous comparison of a clock transition in two independent atomic ensembles using a single ultrastable laser has allowed us to eliminate fluctuations of the laser frequency from the measured frequency difference and to reach a relative measurement error of $10^{-16}$ after 500-s averaging, which corresponds to a relative instability of $2\times10^{-15}/\sqrt{\tau}$. The successful demonstration of the long-term operation of two systems using the synchronous comparison of clock transitions opens the possibility of studying systematic shifts in thulium optical clocks with an uncertainty of $10^{-17}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics in Strong Electromagnetic Fields: Substate Resolved K$\alpha$ Transition Energies in Helium-like Uranium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recorded X-ray spectra of stored and electron cooled helium-like uranium (U$^{90+}$) with an unmatched spectral resolution of close to 90 eV, using novel metallic magnetic calorimeter detectors at CRYRING@ESR. This allowed for an accurate determination of the energies of all four components of the K$\alpha$ transitions in U$^{90+}$. We find good agreement with state-of-the-art bound-state QED calculations for the strong-field regime. Our results do not support any systematic deviation between experiment and theory in helium-like systems, the presence of which was subject of intense debates in recent years.</description>

      <title>Transmission spectroscopy of CF$_4$ molecules in intense x-ray fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear interaction of x-rays with matter is at the heart of understanding and controlling ultrafast molecular dynamics from an atom-specific viewpoint, providing new scientific and analytical opportunities to explore the structure and dynamics of small quantum systems. At increasingly high x-ray intensity, the sensitivity of ultrashort x-ray pulses to specific electronic states and emerging short-lived transient intermediates is of particular relevance for our understanding of fundamental multi-photon absorption processes. In this work, intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses at the European XFEL (EuXFEL) are combined with a gas cell and grating spectrometer for a high-intensity transmission spectroscopy study of multiphoton-induced ultrafast molecular fragmentation dynamics in CF$_4$. This approach unlocks the direct intra-pulse observation of transient fragments, including neutral atoms, by their characteristic absorption lines in the transmitted broad-band x-ray spectrum. The dynamics with and without initially producing fluorine K-shell holes are studied by tuning the central photon energy. The absorption spectra are measured at different FEL intensities to observe nonlinear effects. Transient isolated fluorine atoms and ions are spectroscopically recorded within the ultrashort pulse duration of few tens of femtoseconds. An isosbestic point that signifies the correlated transition between intact neutral CF$_4$ molecules and charged atomic fragments is observed near the fluorine K-edge. The dissociation dynamics and the multiphoton absorption-induced dynamics encoded in the spectra are theoretically interpreted. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of high-intensity x-ray transmission spectroscopy to study ultrafast molecular dynamics with sensitivity to specific intermediate species and their electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Diffraction Imaging of Electron Dynamics in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizing the electron dynamics in four dimensions of space and time is crucial to the understanding of several ubiquitous processes in nature. Hence, ultrafast X-ray and electron imaging tools have been developed to probe the dynamics of matter by means of the time-resolved diffraction imaging (TRDI). In this work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the TRDI to the case of the laser-driven electron dynamics in solid state systems. We demonstrate that the TRDI signal encodes an essential information about the time-dependent electron density of the system under study and thus makes it possible to decipher the ultrafast quantum dynamics and the electron transfer phenomena in solids. We apply the developed approach to image the laser-driven electron dynamics in neutral graphene showing that the predictions made by the fully quantum version of the TRDI deviate significantly from those obtained with the conventional semiclassical approach.</description>

      <title>Application of Magnus expansion for the quantum dynamics of $\Lambda$-systems under periodic driving and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing a sixth order expression for the differential time evolution operator based on the Magnus expansion (ME), we conducted quantum dynamics calculations of a $\Lambda$-system driven by two sinusoidal time dependent fields. For a closed system dynamics, we confirmed the equivalence of the dynamics in the Hilbert space and the Liouville space numerically. We also conducted open system quantum dynamics calculation by generalizing the ME to the non-Hermitian dynamics in the Liouville space for the case where the effects of photonic bath are represented by Lindblad operators. In both cases, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) was assessed. We found significant errors of RWA during initial stages of the dynamics for representative cases where electromagnetically induced transparency or coherent population trapping can be observed. The presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics reduces the errors of RWA, but significant errors for off-diagonal elements of the density operator can still be seen. We also found that approaches to steady state limits of exact dynamics are slower than those for RWA. These results demonstrate the utility of the ME as a general and reliable tool for closed and open system quantum dynamics for time dependent Hamiltonians, and expose potential issues of drawing conclusions based solely on RWA.</description>

      <title>Collective transition quenching in the presence of multiple competing decay channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for 'collective transition quenching', a quantum many-body dissipative phenomenon that occurs in systems with multiple collective decay channels. Despite the competition, interactions suppress all but the dominant decay transition, leading to a 'winner takes all' dynamic where the system primarily settles into the dominant ground state. We prove that, in the presence of permutation symmetry, this problem is exactly solvable for any number of competing channels. Additionally, we develop an approximate model for the dynamics by mapping the evolution into a continuity equation for a fluid, and show analytically that the dominant transition ratio converges to unity with increasing system size as a power-law, for any branching ratio. This near-deterministic preparation of the dominant ground state has broad applicability. As an example we discuss a protocol for molecular photoassociation where collective dynamics effectively acts as a catalyst, amplifying the yield in a particular final state. Our results open new avenues for many-body strategies in the preparation and control of quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five time-dependent orbital optimized coupled-cluster (TD-ooCC) methods, of which four can converge to the complete active space self-consistent-field method, are presented for fermion-mixtures with arbitrary fermion kinds and numbers. Truncation schemes maintaining the intragroup orbital rotation invariance, as well as equations of motion of CC amplitudes and orbitals, are derived. Present methods are compact CC-parameterization alternatives to the time-dependent multiconfiguration self-consistent-field method for systems consisting of arbitrarily different kinds and numbers of interacting fermions. Theoretical analysis of applications of present methods to various chemical systems are reported.</description>

      <title>Correcting heading errors in optically pumped magnetometers through microwave interrogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to measure in situ for heading errors of optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in the challenging parameter regime of compact vapor cells with imperfect optical pumping and high buffer gas pressure. For this, we utilize microwave-driven Ramsey and Rabi frequency spectroscopy (FS) to independently characterize scalar heading errors in free induction decay (FID) signals. Both of these approaches suppress 5-nT inaccuracies in geomagnetic fields caused by nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) shifts in FID measurements to below 0.6 nT. For Ramsey FS, we implement short periods of microwave interrogation within a $\pi/2-t_R-3\pi/2$ Ramsey interferometry sequence, effectively circumventing systematic errors from off-resonant driving. Conversely, Rabi FS leverages an atom-microwave Hamiltonian for accurate modeling of Rabi oscillation frequencies, achieving a measurement precision down to 80 pT$/ \sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ that is limited primarily by technical microwave noise. We show that the fundamental sensitivity of Rabi FS is 30 pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ with our vapor cell parameters through a Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis. This work paves the way for future investigations into the accuracy of hyperfine structure (HFS) magnetometry and contributes to the broader applicability of OPMs in fields ranging from navigation and geophysics to space exploration and unexploded ordinance detection, where heading error mitigation is essential.</description>

      <title>Reconciling mean-squared radius differences in the silver chain through improved measurement and {\it ab initio} calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear charge radius differences in the silver isotopic chain have been reported through different combinations of experiment and theory, exhibiting a tension of two combined standard errors. This study investigates this issue by combining high-accuracy calculations for six low-lying states of atomic silver with an improved measurement of the $5s ^2S_{1/2} - 5p ^2P_{3/2}$ transition optical isotope shift. Our calculations predict measured electronic transition energies in Ag I at the 0.3\% level, the highest accuracy achieved in this system so far. We calculate electronic isotope shift factors by employing analytical response relativistic coupled-cluster theory, and find that a consistent charge radius difference between $^{107,109}$Ag is returned when combining our calculations with the available optical isotope shift measurements. We therefore recommend an improved value for the mean-squared charge radius difference between $^{107}$Ag and $^{109}$Ag as $0.207(3)[4]$ fm$^2$, within one combined error from the value derived from muonic Ag experiments, and an updated set of charge radii differences across the isotopic chain.</description>

      <title>Genetics-based deperturbation analysis for the spin-orbit coupled ${\rm A}^1\Sigma^+$ and ${\rm b}^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deperturbation analysis of the spin-orbit coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ and $\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb based on the rovibrational energy levels observed previously by photoassociation spectroscopy in bosonic $^7$Li$^{85}$Rb molecule. Using the genetic algorithm, we fit the potential energy curves of the $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ state and the $\rm b^3\Pi$ state into point-wise form. We then fit these point-wise potentials along with the spin-orbit coupling into expanded Morse oscillator functional form and optimise analytical parameters based on the experimental data. From the fitted results, we calculate the transition dipole moment matrix elements for transitions from the rovibrational levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state to the Feshbach state and the absolute rovibrational ground state for fermionic $^6$Li$^{87}$Rb molecule. Based on the calculated transition dipole moment matrix elements, several levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state are predicted to be suitable as the intermediate state for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage transfer from the Feshbach state to the absolute rovibrational ground state. In addition, we also provide a similar estimation for ${\rm B}^1\Pi$-${\rm c}^3\Sigma_1^+$-${\rm b}^3\Pi_1$ state based on available $ab\ initio$ interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Dissipative time crystal in a strongly interacting Rydberg gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.20070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been well established to characterize classical and quantum phase transitions of matter, such as in condensation, crystallization or quantum magnetism. Generalizations of this paradigm to the time dimension can lead to a time crystal phase, which spontaneously breaks the time translation symmetry of the system. Whereas the existence of a continuous time crystal at equilibrium has been challenged by no-go theorems, this difficulty can be circumvented by dissipation in an open system. Here, we report the experimental observation of such dissipative time crystalline order in a room-temperature atomic gas, where ground-state atoms are continuously driven to Rydberg states. The emergent time crystal is revealed by persistent oscillations of the photon transmission, and we show that the observed limit cycles arise from the coexistence and competition between distinct Rydberg components. The nondecaying autocorrelation of the oscillation, together with the robustness against temporal noises, indicate the establishment of true long-range temporal order and demonstrates the realization of a continuous time crystal.</description>

      <title>Towards a zero magnetic field environment for ultracold atoms experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimization of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in ultracold gas research. For instance, the contact interaction dominates all the other energy scales in the zero magnetic field limit, giving rise to novel quantum phases of matter. However, lowering magnetic fields well below the mG level is often challenging in ultracold gas experiments. In this article, we apply Landau-Zener spectroscopy to characterize and reduce the magnetic field on an ultracold gas of sodium atoms to a few tens of {\mu}G. The lowest magnetic field achieved here opens to observing novel phases of matter with ultracold spinor Bose gases.</description>
