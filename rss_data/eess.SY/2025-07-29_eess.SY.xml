      <title>Simultaneous improvement of control and estimation for battery management systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state of charge of battery systems is an important metric typically estimated by observation models, represented by open-circuit voltage graphs. These observation models are often nonlinear in the state of charge, resulting in varying observability from a state estimation perspective. In this paper, we employ a stochastic optimal control (also known as dual control) approach to simultaneously satisfy the control objective in the state of charge of battery systems and improve estimation accuracy. This is achieved implicitly by prioritizing trajectories that pass through high-observability regions of the state space, thereby improving the quality of future measurements. We apply our algorithm to a numerical simulation of a multi-battery system and show a statistical improvement in both the control objective and the state estimation error.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Control of Stochastic Oscillators via Periodic and Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of steering the phase distribution of oscillators all receiving the same control input to a given target distribution. In a large population limit, the distribution of oscillators can be described by a probability density. Then, our problem can be seen as that of ensemble control with a constraint on the steady-state density. In particular, we consider the case where oscillators are subject to stochastic noise, for which the theoretical understanding is still lacking. First, we characterize the reachability of the phase distribution under periodic feedforward control via the Fourier coefficients of the target density and the phase sensitivity function of oscillators. This enables us to design a periodic input that makes the stationary distribution of oscillators closest to the target by solving a convex optimization problem. Next, we devise an ensemble control method combining periodic and feedback control, where the feedback component is designed to accelerate the convergence of the distribution of oscillators. We exhibit some convergence results for the proposed method, including a result that holds even under measurement errors in the phase distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Experimental Implementation and Validation of Predictor-Based CACC for Vehicular Platoons With Distinct Actuation Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide experimental validation, in a pair of vehicles, of a recently introduced predictor-based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design, developed for achieving delay compensation in heterogeneous vehicular platoons subject to long actuation delays that may be distinct for each individual vehicle. We provide the explicit formulae of the control design that is implemented, accounting for the effect of zero-order hold and sampled measurements; as well as we obtain vehicle and string stability conditions numerically, via derivation of the transfer functions relating the speeds of pairs of consecutive vehicles. We also present consistent simulation results for a platoon with a larger number of vehicles, under digital implementation of the controller. Both the simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the predictor-based CACC design in guaranteeing individual vehicle stability, string stability, and tracking, despite long/distinct actuation delays.</description>

      <title>Deep Neuro-Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller for Higher-Order Heterogeneous Nonlinear Multi-Agent Teams with Leader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-based neuro-adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy for leader-follower tracking in multi-agent systems with higher-order, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and unknown dynamics under external disturbances. The DNN is used to compensate the unknown nonlinear dynamics with higher accuracy than shallow neural networks (NNs) and SMC ensures robust tracking. This framework employs restricted potential functions within a set-theoretic paradigm to ensure system trajectories remain bounded within a compact set, improving robustness against approximation errors and external disturbances. The control scheme is grounded in non-smooth Lyapunov stability theory, with update laws derived for both inner and outer layer network weights of DNN. A numerical example is simulated that showcases the proposed controller's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Greenhouse Climate Regulation in Lettuce Cultivation Using BiLSTM and GRU Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient greenhouse management is essential for sustainable food production in response to a growing global population. However, maintaining optimal indoor climates requires significant energy and resources, making advanced control systems critical for economic viability and environmental sustainability. Traditional greenhouse models are often complex and imprecise, limiting the effectiveness of conventional control strategies. To address these challenges, this study investigates data-driven predictive control methods using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Our experiments showed that GRU-based predictive control reduced temperature and humidity violations by up to 5\% and required 40\% less computation time than the LSTM approach, all while maintaining equivalent economic performance and crop yield. These findings demonstrate that GRU-based predictive control offers a more efficient and practical solution for real-time greenhouse climate regulation in precision agriculture.</description>

Abstract: Stray flux tubes around cylindrical poles are commonly modelled starting from the results for planar flux tubes using the circumference of the cylinder as depth. While this is a tried and tested approach, we here discuss analytical expressions using the actual axisymmetric geometry of a fraction of a hollow torus and compare their results to those of the accepted approach.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale EV charging on the real-time operation of distribution systems: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Game-Based Multi-Agent Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic decision-making framework for autonomous driving in multi-agent scenarios. A novel hierarchical game-based decision framework is developed for the ego vehicle. This framework features an interaction graph, which characterizes the interaction relationships between the ego and its surrounding traffic agents (including AVs, human driven vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, and others), and enables the ego to smartly select a limited number of agents as its game players. Compared to the standard multi-player games, where all surrounding agents are considered as game players, the hierarchical game significantly reduces the computational complexity. In addition, compared to pairwise games, the most popular approach in the literature, the hierarchical game promises more efficient decisions for the ego (in terms of less unnecessary waiting and yielding). To further reduce the computational cost, we then propose an improved hierarchical game, which decomposes the hierarchical game into a set of sub-games. Decision safety and efficiency are analyzed in both hierarchical games. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, with an intersection-crossing scenario as a case study.</description>

      <title>Planning Persuasive Trajectories Based on a Leader-Follower Game Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework that enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to proactively shape the intentions and behaviors of interacting human drivers. The framework employs a leader-follower game model with an adaptive role mechanism to predict human interaction intentions and behaviors. It then utilizes a branch model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to plan the AV trajectory, persuading the human to adopt the desired intention. The proposed framework is demonstrated in an intersection scenario. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the framework for generating persuasive AV trajectories despite uncertainties.</description>

      <title>RATE: An LLM-Powered Retrieval Augmented Generation Technology-Extraction Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678 research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They also offer new insights into emerging trends within the BCI-XR field. The source code is available https://github.com/AryaAftab/RATE</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Green Energy Integration in Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-optimized energy management system for e-commerce data centers, aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The proposed system leverages DRL algorithms to dynamically manage the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and grid power, adapting to fluctuating energy availability in real time. The study demonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\% reduction in energy costs, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods (28\%) and heuristic approaches (22\%). Additionally, it maintains a low SLA violation rate of 1.5\%, compared to 3.0\% for RL and 4.8\% for heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\% improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\% reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly solution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior performance in balancing multiple objectives. Through rigorous testing and ablation studies, the paper validates the effectiveness of the DRL model's architecture and parameters, offering a robust solution for energy management in data centers. The findings highlight the potential of DRL in advancing energy optimization strategies and addressing sustainability challenges.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Quantitative Cyber-Physical Reliability of SCADA Systems in Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (V2G) Capable Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services. However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling based on IEEE RTS-79 system data. This work presents how AV2G-based attacks degrade system performance by using Monte Carlo simulations method, highlighting the need for cybersecurity-hardening strategies in smart grid design.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.</description>

      <title>Fluidically Innervated Lattices Make Versatile and Durable Tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Sliding Mode Control for Uncertain Systems with Time-Varying Delays via Predictor Feedback and Super-Twisting Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stabilization control strategy for linear time-invariant systems affected by known time-varying measurement delays and matched unknown nonlinear disturbances, which may encompass actuator faults. It is considered that part of the state vector is not available for real-time measurement. To address this, the proposed approach combines an open-loop predictor with a state observer designed using the Super-Twisting Algorithm, aiming to compensate for the delays and estimate the unmeasured state components. Specifically, the nonlinear observer-based framework enables the reconstruction of unmodeled fault signals without assuming that they originate from a known exogenous system, offering robustness against parametric uncertainties. Meanwhile, the predictor forwards the delayed output in time. Subsequently, a sliding mode control law is formulated to enforce an ideal sliding mode and ensure global stabilization, even under a broader class of perturbations, unmodeled disturbances, parametric uncertainties, and delays, owing to the integration of the Super-Twisting observer. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Projecting the New Body: How Body Image Evolves During Learning to Walk with a Wearable Robot</title>

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability, and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal, indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination. However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained, likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>Systolic Array-based Accelerator for State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Constrained Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e., the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Modeling of Vehicular Maneuvers and Interactions at Urban Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur. Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay, making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Benders decomposition and enhanced SDDP for multistage stochastic programs with block-separable multistage recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to efficiently solve multistage stochastic programs with block separable recourse where each recourse problem is a multistage stochastic program with stage-wise independent uncertainty. The algorithm first decomposes the full problem into a reduced master problem and subproblems using Adaptive Benders decomposition. The subproblems are then solved by an enhanced SDDP. The enhancement includes (1) valid bounds at each iteration, (2) a path exploration rule, (3) cut sharing among subproblems, and (4) guaranteed {\delta}-optimal convergence. The cuts for the subproblems are then shared by calling adaptive oracles. The key contribution of the paper is the first algorithm for solving this class of problems. The algorithm is demonstrated on a power system investment planning problem with multi-timescale uncertainty. The case study results show that (1) the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve this type of problem, (2) deterministic wind modelling underestimate the objective function, and (3) stochastic modelling of wind leads to different investment decisions.</description>

      <title>A Graphical Method for Designing Time-Optimal Non-Cartesian Gradient Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges for non-Cartesian MRI is the need of designing time-optimal and hardware-compatible gradient waveforms for the provided $k$-space trajectory. Currently dominant methods either work only for certain trajectories or require significant computation time. In this paper, we aim to develop a fast general method that is able to generate time-optimal gradient waveforms for arbitrary non-Cartesian trajectories satisfying both slew rate and gradient constraints. In the proposed method, the gradient waveform is projected into a space defined by the gradients along the spatial directions, termed as $g$-space. In the constructed $g$-space, the problem of finding the next gradient vector given the current gradient vector under desired slew rate limit and with desired direction is simplified to finding the intersection between a line and a circle. To handle trajectories with increasing curvature, a Forward and Backward Sweep (FBS) strategy is introduced, which ensures the existence of the solution to the above mentioned geometry problem for arbitrary trajectories. Furthermore, trajectory reparameterization is proposed to ensure trajectory fidelity. We compare the proposed method with the previous optimal-control method in simulations and validate its feasibility for real MR acquisitions in phantom and human knee for a wide range of non-Cartesian trajectories. The proposed method enables accurate and fast gradient waveform design, achieving significant reduction in computation time and slew rate overshoot compared to the previous method. The source code will be publicly accessible upon publication of this study.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the first SCL-band long-haul transmission using G.654.E-compliant fibre, achieving 100.8 Tb/s (GMI) over 1552 km, despite its 1520 nm cutoff wavelength. Due to the fibre's ultra-low loss and low nonlinearity, the achievable-information-rate with lumped amplification is comparable to that of G.652.D-compliant fibre links with distributed-Raman-amplification.</description>

Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance for Convex Primitives via Differentiable Optimization Based High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of dynamical systems is crucial, where collision avoidance is a primary concern. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.</description>

Abstract: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model-predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and develop an optimal control strategy using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework, along with our Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture, allows for custom transient behavior, predictive control, and closed-loop feedback, addressing limitations of existing methods. Comparative analyses with established model-predictive controllers revealed Hion controllers' superior optimality and tracking capabilities. Optimal control strategies are also demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Core Loss -- Cycle-by-cycle Modeling of Power Magnetics in PWM DC-AC Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, PWM excitation is one of the most common waveforms seen by magnetic components in power electronic converters. Core loss modelling approaches such as improved Generalized Steinmetz equation (iGSE) or the loss map based on composite waveform hypothesis (CWH) process the PWM excitation piecewisely, which is proven to be effective for DC DC converters. As the additional challenge in PWM DC AC converters, the fundamental-frequency sinewave component induces the "major loop loss" on top of the piecewise high-frequency segments, which however cannot be modelled on a switching cycle basis by any existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fundamental concept, instantaneous core loss, which is the time-domain core loss observed experimentally for the first time in history. Extending the reactive voltage cancellation concept, this work presents a method to measure the instantaneous core loss, which only contains real power loss, as a function of time. Based on measurements in evaluated soft magnetic components, it was discovered that the discharging stage exhibits higher core loss than the charging stage. A modelling approach is then proposed to break down the major loop core loss, typically an average value in the literature, into the time domain to enable cycle-by-cycle modelling of core losses in PWM converters. This work enhances the fundamental understanding of the core loss process by moving from the average model to the time-domain model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes tackling safety-critical stochastic Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks with a sample-based, model-based approach. At the core of the method lies a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that acts as function approximation, providing a model-based predictive control policy. To ensure safety, a probabilistic Control Barrier Function (CBF) is integrated into the MPC controller. To approximate the effects of stochasticies in the optimal control formulation and to fulfil the probabilistic CBF condition, a sample-based approach with guarantees is employed. Furthermore, to counterbalance the additional computational burden due to sampling, a learnable terminal cost formulation is included in the MPC objective. An RL algorithm is deployed to learn both the terminal cost and the CBF constraint. Results from a numerical experiment on a constrained LTI problem corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in reducing computation time while preserving control performance and safety.</description>

      <title>Unifying Direct and Indirect Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops learning-enabled safe controllers for linear systems subject to system uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Given the disturbance zonotope, the databased closed-loop dynamics (CLDs) are first characterized using a matrix zonotope (MZ), and refined through several steps to yield a constrained matrix zonotope (CMZ). This refinement is achieved by introducing conformal equality constraints that eliminate incompatible disturbance realizations. More precisely, prior knowledge and observed data are used separately to construct CMZ representations of disturbance sequences that conform to both data and prior knowledge, and are intersected by the initial MZ of the disturbance sequence, producing a refined CMZ. This approach reduces conservatism. To further reduce the conservativeness, we unify open-loop learning with closed-loop learning by presenting a novel set-membership identification method that models open-loop dynamics as a CMZ. The prior knowledge serves as an initial feasible open-loop model set (FOLMS) of this CMZ, which is refined into a posterior set whenever new informative online data becomes available. This posterior FOLMS then adaptively replaces the prior knowledge set employed in the disturbance elimination of the closed-loop learning process. The resulting refined parameterized set of CLD is subsequently leveraged to directly and adaptively learn a controller that robustly enforces safety. Toward this goal, we formulate a linear programming problem that guarantees {\lambda}contractiveness of a polyhedral safe set. A simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and support the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. However, existing data-driven approaches to learning the Koopman operator rely on batch data. In this work, we present a sparse online learning algorithm that learns the Koopman operator iteratively via stochastic approximation, with explicit control over model complexity and provable convergence guarantees. Specifically, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and address the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen RKHS. In this mis-specified setting, we relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator. We further establish both asymptotic and finite-time convergence guarantees for our learning algorithm in mis-specified setting, with trajectory-based sampling where the data arrive sequentially over time. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to learn unknown nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>A General Safety Framework for Autonomous Manipulation in Human Environments</title>

Abstract: Autonomous robots are projected to significantly augment the manual workforce, especially in repetitive and hazardous tasks. For a successful deployment of such robots in human environments, it is crucial to guarantee human safety. State-of-the-art approaches to ensure human safety are either too conservative to permit a natural human-robot collaboration or make strong assumptions that do not hold for autonomous robots, e.g., knowledge of a pre-defined trajectory. Therefore, we propose the shield for Safe Autonomous human-robot collaboration through Reachability Analysis (SARA shield). This novel power and force limiting framework provides formal safety guarantees for manipulation in human environments while realizing fast robot speeds. As unconstrained contacts allow for significantly higher contact forces than constrained contacts (also known as clamping), we use reachability analysis to classify potential contacts by their type in a formally correct way. For each contact type, we formally verify that the kinetic energy of the robot is below pain and injury thresholds for the respective human body part in contact. Our experiments show that SARA shield satisfies the contact safety constraints while significantly improving the robot performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.</description>
