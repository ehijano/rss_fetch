      <title>Improving the mean-field approximation in continuous models of population dynamics with nonlocal dispersal: applications to vegetation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spot patterns, in which vegetation patches form a hexagonal lattice, are frequent in nature and could serve as an early-warning indicator of abrupt vegetation collapses. Consequently, they have been intensively studied using both individual-based models and density-based field equations. Yet, the relationship between these two approaches remains unclear, particularly in scenarios where vegetation dynamics exhibit strong long-range spatial correlations and traditional mean-field approximations fail. To solve this issue, we develop a new method that refines mean-field approximations by describing both the dynamics of the biomass density field and its spatial correlations. This new approach harnesses the strengths of both individual and density-based mdoels, treating spatial correlations explicitly and allowing for the identification of spatial instabilities resulting in periodic patterns. Our results indicate that this new approximation predicts the parameter regimes where regular periodic patterns emerge more accurately than mean-field models, suggesting that it could provide a more robust framework to perform further nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Soliton gas of the integrable Boussinesq equation and its generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised hydrodynamics (GHD) is a recent and powerful framework to study many-body integrable systems, quantum or classical, out of equilibrium. It has been applied to several models, from the delta Bose gas to the XXZ spin chain, the KdV soliton gas and many more. Yet it has only been applied to (1+1)-dimensional systems and generalisation to higher dimensions of space is non-trivial. We study the Boussinesq equation which, while generally considered to be less physically relevant than the KdV equation, is interesting as a stationary reduction of the (boosted) Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, a prototypical and universal example of a nonlinear integrable PDE in (2+1) dimensions. We follow a heuristic approach inspired by the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in order to construct the GHD of the Boussinesq soliton gas. Such approach allows for a statistical mechanics interpretation of the Boussinesq soliton gas that comes naturally with the GHD picture. This is to be seen as a first step in the construction of the KP soliton gas, yielding insight on some classes of solutions from which we may be able to build an intuition on how to devise a more general theory. This also offers another perspective on the construction of anisotropic bidirectional soliton gases previously introduced phenomenologically by Congy et al (2021).</description>

      <title>Deep noise squeezing in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. We use Green's functions to analyse the response of resonators to added noise. In one approach, we obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method, while in the second approach, exactly, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonators response to added noise. In a single parametric resonator, due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning at the instability threshold in a single parametrically-driven resonator. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a dynamical system consisting a parametric resonator linearly coupled to a harmonic resonator. In this system, we were able to observe deep squeezing at around $-40$~dB in one of the quadratures of the harmonic resonator response. We noticed that this occurs near a Hopf bifurcation to parametric instability, which is only possible when the dynamics of the coupled resonators cannot be decomposed into normal modes. Finally, we also showed that our analysis of squeezing based on Floquet theory can be applied to multiple coupled resonators with parametric modulation and multiple noise inputs.</description>
