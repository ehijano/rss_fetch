      <title>SwiftKV: An Edge-Oriented Attention Algorithm and Multi-Head Accelerator for Fast, Efficient LLM Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge acceleration for large language models is crucial for their widespread application; however, achieving fast attention inference and efficient decoding on resource-constrained edge accelerators remains challenging. This paper presents SwiftKV Attention, a per-token pipelined, low-latency single-pass attention inference algorithm, where every (kt, vt) in the KV cache is processed exactly once in a uniform per-token pipeline without score materialization, blockwise softmax, or a second pass, thereby enabling fast execution on edge accelerators with a single hardware set and no resource-intensive parallelism. Furthermore, to address the limited support for multi-head LLM decoding in existing accelerators, we design the SwiftKV-MHA accelerator, which enables high precision attention and low precision GEMV on the same processor array, achieving fast and efficient multi-head parallel decoding. Experimental results show that, on the edge accelerator, the SwiftKV Attention algorithm achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention and significantly outperforms other attention algorithms. SwiftKV-MHA further reduces attention latency by 13.48*; under the same settings, it improves generation speed by 17.4% and increases token efficiency by 1.98* compared with state-of-the-art works.</description>

      <title>RidgeWalker: Perfectly Pipelined Graph Random Walks on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Random Walks (GRWs) offer efficient approximations of key graph properties and have been widely adopted in many applications. However, GRW workloads are notoriously difficult to accelerate due to their strong data dependencies, irregular memory access patterns, and imbalanced execution behavior. While recent work explores FPGA-based accelerators for GRWs, existing solutions fall far short of hardware potential due to inefficient pipelining and static scheduling. This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs. The key insight behind RidgeWalker is that the Markov property of GRWs allows decomposition into stateless, fine-grained tasks that can be executed out-of-order without compromising correctness. Building on this, RidgeWalker introduces an asynchronous pipeline architecture with a feedback-driven scheduler grounded in queuing theory, enabling perfect pipelining and adaptive load balancing. We prototype RidgeWalker on datacenter FPGAs and evaluated it across a range of GRW algorithms and real-world graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RidgeWalker achieves an average speedup of 7.0x over state-of-the-art FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively.

      <title>OpenACM: An Open-Source SRAM-Based Approximate CiM Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of data-intensive AI workloads has exacerbated the ``memory wall'' bottleneck. Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) using SRAM offers a scalable solution, but its vast design space makes manual design impractical, creating a need for automated compilers. A key opportunity lies in approximate computing, which leverages the error tolerance of AI applications for significant energy savings. However, existing DCiM compilers focus on exact arithmetic, failing to exploit this optimization. This paper introduces OpenACM, the first open-source, accuracy-aware compiler for SRAM-based approximate DCiM architectures. OpenACM bridges the gap between application error tolerance and hardware automation. Its key contribution is an integrated library of accuracy-configurable multipliers (exact, tunable approximate, and logarithmic), enabling designers to make fine-grained accuracy-energy trade-offs. The compiler automates the generation of the DCiM architecture, integrating a transistor-level customizable SRAM macro with variation-aware characterization into a complete, open-source physical design flow based on OpenROAD and the FreePDK45 library. This ensures full reproducibility and accessibility, removing dependencies on proprietary tools. Experimental results on representative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate that OpenACM achieves energy savings of up to 64\% with negligible loss in application accuracy.

      <title>Mugi: Value Level Parallelism For Efficient LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.</description>

      <title>InterPUF: Distributed Authentication via Physically Unclonable Functions and Multi-party Computation for Reconfigurable Interposers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern system-in-package (SiP) platforms increasingly adopt reconfigurable interposers to enable plug-and-play chiplet integration across heterogeneous multi-vendor ecosystems. However, this flexibility introduces severe trust challenges, as traditional authentication schemes fail to scale or adapt in decentralized, post-fabrication programmable environments. This paper presents InterPUF, a compact and scalable authentication framework that transforms the interposer into a distributed root of trust. InterPUF embeds a route-based differential delay physically unclonable function (PUF) across the reconfigurable interconnect and secures authentication using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring raw PUF signatures are never exposed. Our hardware evaluation shows only 0.23% area and 0.072% power overhead across diverse chiplets while preserving authentication latency within tens of nanoseconds. Simulation results using pyPUF confirm strong uniqueness, reliability, and modeling resistance under process, voltage, and temperature variations. By combining interposer-resident PUF primitives with cryptographic hashing and collaborative verification, InterPUF enforces a minimal-trust authentication model without relying on a centralized anchor.</description>

      <title>IMS: Intelligent Hardware Monitoring System for Secure SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol exhibits security vulnerabilities, enabling partial or complete denial-of-service (DoS) through protocol-violation attacks. The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with &lt;=3% latency overhead, and throughput of &gt;2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.</description>

      <title>CarbonClarity: Understanding and Addressing Uncertainty in Embodied Carbon for Sustainable Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied carbon footprint modeling has become an area of growing interest due to its significant contribution to carbon emissions in computing. However, the deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of uncertainty modeling limits system designers' ability to make informed, carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95th percentile of embodied carbon per cm$^2$ can reach up to 1.6X for the 7nm technology node. Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty, achieving an 18% reduction in the 95th percentile compared to monolithic designs for the mobile application.</description>
