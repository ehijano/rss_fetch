      <title>A Dynamic Framework for Semantic Grouping of Common Data Elements (CDE) Using Embeddings and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns. These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4) supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000 CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy, performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement (Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-like Preference Profiling in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aspire to profile users by interpreting their interaction histories, echoing how humans make decisions by weighing experience, relative preference strength, and situational relevance. Yet, existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit, neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation RecPO exploits adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction, maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting contexts.</description>

      <title>TransAct V2: Lifelong User Action Sequence Modeling on Pinterest Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling user action sequences has become a popular focus in industrial recommendation system research, particularly for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction tasks. However, industry-scale CTR models often rely on short user sequences, limiting their ability to capture long-term behavior. Additionally, these models typically lack an integrated action-prediction task within a point-wise ranking framework, reducing their predictive power. They also rarely address the infrastructure challenges involved in efficiently serving large-scale sequential models. In this paper, we introduce TransAct V2, a production model for Pinterest's Homefeed ranking system, featuring three key innovations: (1) leveraging very long user sequences to improve CTR predictions, (2) integrating a Next Action Loss function for enhanced user action forecasting, and (3) employing scalable, low-latency deployment solutions tailored to handle the computational demands of extended user action sequences.</description>

      <title>NextQuill: Causal Preference Modeling for Enhancing LLM Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) for individual users has become increasingly important as they are progressively integrated into real-world applications to support users' daily lives. However, existing personalization approaches often fail to distinguish which components of model predictions and training data truly reflect user preferences, leading to superficial personalization alignment. In this paper, we introduce NextQuill, a novel LLM personalization alignment framework grounded in causal preference modeling. We approach personalization from a causal perspective, treating both model predictions and ground-truth data generation as outcomes influenced by user preferences, along with other factors. We define the true preference effect as the causal impact of user history (which reflects preferences) on each token prediction or data generation instance, estimated through causal intervention techniques. Building on this insight, NextQuill introduces two complementary alignment strategies: (1) aligning model-internal causal preference effects on predictions with those reflected in ground-truth data, rather than indiscriminately fitting predictions, and (2) focusing on fitting preference-bearing tokens identified via ground-truth data preference effects, rather than treating all tokens uniformly. By integrating these strategies, NextQuill shifts the alignment process toward learning from causal preference effects, facilitating more effective and personalized adaptation. Experiments across multiple personalization benchmarks demonstrate that NextQuill significantly improves personalization quality, offering a principled, causal foundation for LLM personalization. Our codes are available on https://github.com/juntaoyou/NextQuill.</description>

      <title>Learning Binarized Representations with Pseudo-positive Sample Enhancement for Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning vectorized embeddings is fundamental to many recommender systems for user-item matching. To enable efficient online inference, representation binarization, which embeds latent features into compact binary sequences, has recently shown significant promise in optimizing both memory usage and computational overhead. However, existing approaches primarily focus on numerical quantization, neglecting the associated information loss, which often results in noticeable performance degradation. To address these issues, we study the problem of graph representation binarization for efficient collaborative filtering. Our findings indicate that explicitly mitigating information loss at various stages of embedding binarization has a significant positive impact on performance. Building on these insights, we propose an enhanced framework, BiGeaR++, which specifically leverages supervisory signals from pseudo-positive samples, incorporating both real item data and latent embedding samples. Compared to its predecessor BiGeaR, BiGeaR++ introduces a fine-grained inference distillation mechanism and an effective embedding sample synthesis approach. Empirical evaluations across five real-world datasets demonstrate that the new designs in BiGeaR++ work seamlessly well with other modules, delivering substantial improvements of around 1%-10% over BiGeaR and thus achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to the competing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/BiGeaR-SS.</description>

      <title>UTCS: Effective Unsupervised Temporal Community Search with Pre-training of Temporal Dynamics and Subgraph Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world applications, the evolving relationships between entities can be modeled as temporal graphs, where each edge has a timestamp representing the interaction time.
  As a fundamental problem in graph analysis, {\it community search (CS)} in temporal graphs has received growing attention but exhibits two major limitations: (1) Traditional methods typically require predefined subgraph structures, which are not always known in advance. (2) Learning-based methods struggle to capture temporal interaction information. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we propose an effective \textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}ommunity \textbf{S}earch with pre-training of temporal dynamics and subgraph knowledge model (\textbf{\model}). \model~contains two key stages: offline pre-training and online search. In the first stage, we introduce multiple learning objectives to facilitate the pre-training process in the unsupervised learning setting. In the second stage, we identify a candidate subgraph and compute community scores using the pre-trained node representations and a novel scoring mechanism to determine the final community members. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Combining social relations and interaction data in Recommender System with Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recommender system is an important subject in the field of data mining, where the item rating information from users is exploited and processed to make suitable recommendations with all other users. The recommender system creates convenience for e-commerce users and stimulates the consumption of items that are suitable for users. In addition to e-commerce, a recommender system is also used to provide recommendations on books to read, movies to watch, courses to take or websites to visit. Similarity between users is an important impact for recommendation, which could be calculated from the data of past user ratings of the item by methods of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization or singular vector decomposition. In the development of graph data mining techniques, the relationships between users and items can be represented by matrices from which collaborative filtering could be done with the larger database, more accurate and faster in calculation. All these data can be represented graphically and mined by today's highly developed graph neural network models. On the other hand, users' social friendship data also influence consumption habits because recommendations from friends will be considered more carefully than information sources. However, combining a user's friend influence and the similarity between users whose similar shopping habits is challenging. Because the information is noisy and it affects each particular data set in different ways. In this study, we present the input data processing method to remove outliers which are single reviews or users with little interaction with the items; the next proposed model will combine the social relationship data and the similarity in the rating history of users to improve the accuracy and recall of the recommender system.</description>

      <title>DeepShop: A Benchmark for Deep Research Shopping Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web agents for online shopping have shown great promise in automating user interactions across e-commerce platforms. Benchmarks for assessing such agents do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as "Find iPhone 15." Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments. DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution: Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels: easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction, while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the advancement of deep research shopping agents.</description>

      <title>MMM4Rec: An Transfer-Efficient Framework for Multi-modal Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) systems model user preferences by analyzing interaction histories. Although transferable multi-modal SR architectures demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional ID-based approaches, current methods incur substantial fine-tuning costs when adapting to new domains due to complex optimization requirements and negative transfer effects - a significant deployment bottleneck that hinders engineers from efficiently repurposing pre-trained models for novel application scenarios with minimal tuning overhead. We propose MMM4Rec (Multi-Modal Mamba for Sequential Recommendation), a novel multi-modal SR framework that incorporates a dedicated algebraic constraint mechanism for efficient transfer learning. By combining State Space Duality (SSD)'s temporal decay properties with a time-aware modeling design, our model dynamically prioritizes key modality information, overcoming limitations of Transformer-based approaches. The framework implements a constrained two-stage process: (1) sequence-level cross-modal alignment via shared projection matrices, followed by (2) temporal fusion using our newly designed Cross-SSD module and dual-channel Fourier adaptive filtering. This architecture maintains semantic consistency while suppressing noise propagation.MMM4Rec achieves rapid fine-tuning convergence with simple cross-entropy loss, significantly improving multi-modal recommendation accuracy while maintaining strong transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate MMM4Rec's state-of-the-art performance, achieving the maximum 31.78% NDCG@10 improvement over existing models and exhibiting 10 times faster average convergence speed when transferring to large-scale downstream datasets.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch in Active Learning: LLM Embedding Quality Dictates Query Strategy Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Unseen Capabilities: How Many Theorems Do LLMs Know?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However, current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge -- information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.</description>

      <title>Entity Image and Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The datasets are accessible through the GitHub page: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit-retrieval.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Information Retrieval with a Monolingual Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages, therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones. In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual and code switching use cases.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Named Entity Recognition Models for Russian Cultural News Texts: From BERT to LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for person names within the specialized domain of Russian news texts concerning cultural events. The study utilizes the unique SPbLitGuide dataset, a collection of event announcements from Saint Petersburg spanning 1999 to 2019. A comparative evaluation of diverse NER models is presented, encompassing established transformer-based architectures such as DeepPavlov, RoBERTa, and SpaCy, alongside recent Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. Key findings highlight the superior performance of GPT-4o when provided with specific prompting for JSON output, achieving an F1 score of 0.93. Furthermore, GPT-4 demonstrated the highest precision at 0.99. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of current NER model capabilities and limitations when applied to morphologically rich languages like Russian within the cultural heritage domain, offering insights for researchers and practitioners. Follow-up evaluation with GPT-4.1 (April 2025) achieves F1=0.94 for both simple and structured prompts, demonstrating rapid progress across model families and simplified deployment requirements.</description>

      <title>Token and Span Classification for Entity Recognition in French Historical Encyclopedias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in historical texts presents unique challenges due to non-standardized language, archaic orthography, and nested or overlapping entities. This study benchmarks a diverse set of NER approaches, ranging from classical Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and spaCy-based models to transformer-based architectures such as CamemBERT and sequence-labeling models like Flair. Experiments are conducted on the GeoEDdA dataset, a richly annotated corpus derived from 18th-century French encyclopedias. We propose framing NER as both token-level and span-level classification to accommodate complex nested entity structures typical of historical documents. Additionally, we evaluate the emerging potential of few-shot prompting with generative language models for low-resource scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially on nested entities, generative models offer promising alternatives when labeled data are scarce. The study highlights ongoing challenges in historical NER and suggests avenues for hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods to better capture the intricacies of early modern French text.</description>

      <title>INESC-ID @ eRisk 2025: Exploring Fine-Tuned, Similarity-Based, and Prompt-Based Approaches to Depression Symptom Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance. Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision (R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance, particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation, outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Information Retrieval to Enhance Spoken Language Understanding Prompts in Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home assistants, booking systems, or recommendations. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation as Noisy In-Context Learning: A Unified Theory and Risk Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks, such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces annotative indexing, a novel framework that unifies and generalizes traditional inverted indexes, column stores, object stores, and graph databases. As a result, annotative indexing can provide the underlying indexing framework for databases that support retrieval augmented generation, knowledge graphs, entity retrieval, semi-structured data, and ranked retrieval. While we primarily focus on human language data in the form of text, annotative indexing is sufficiently general to support a range of other datatypes, and we provide examples of SQL-like queries over a JSON store that includes numbers and dates. Taking advantage of the flexibility of annotative indexing, we also demonstrate a fully dynamic annotative index incorporating support for ACID properties of transactions with hundreds of multiple concurrent readers and writers.</description>

      <title>KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections.
  To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate 13 solutions on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</description>

      <title>ArchRAG: Attributed Community-based Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) for solving question-answer (QA) tasks. The state-of-the-art RAG approaches often use the graph data as the external data since they capture the rich semantic information and link relationships between entities. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches cannot accurately identify the relevant information from the graph and also consume large numbers of tokens in the online retrieval process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel graph-based RAG approach, called Attributed Community-based Hierarchical RAG (ArchRAG), by augmenting the question using attributed communities, and also introducing a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method. To retrieve the most relevant information from the graph for the question, we build a novel hierarchical index structure for the attributed communities and develop an effective online retrieval method. Experimental results demonstrate that ArchRAG outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and token cost. Moreover, ArchRAG has been successfully applied to domain knowledge QA in Huawei Cloud Computing.</description>

      <title>LSRP: A Leader-Subordinate Retrieval Framework for Privacy-Preserving Cloud-Device Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-device collaboration leverages on-cloud Large Language Models (LLMs) for handling public user queries and on-device Small Language Models (SLMs) for processing private user data, collectively forming a powerful and privacy-preserving solution. However, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the scalable problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs while underutilizing the advantage of on-device SLMs in accessing and processing personalized data. This leads to two interconnected issues: 1) Limited utilization of the problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs, which fail to align with personalized user-task needs, and 2) Inadequate integration of user data into on-device SLM responses, resulting in mismatches in contextual user information.
  In this paper, we propose a Leader-Subordinate Retrieval framework for Privacy-preserving cloud-device collaboration (LSRP), a novel solution that bridges these gaps by: 1) enhancing on-cloud LLM guidance to on-device SLM through a dynamic selection of task-specific leader strategies named as user-to-user retrieval-augmented generation (U-U-RAG), and 2) integrating the data advantages of on-device SLMs through small model feedback Direct Preference Optimization (SMFB-DPO) for aligning the on-cloud LLM with the on-device SLM. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that LSRP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving question-answer relevance and personalization, while preserving user privacy through efficient on-device retrieval.

      <title>Comparing Lexical and Semantic Vector Search Methods When Classifying Medical Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification is a common AI problem, and vector search is a typical solution. This transforms a given body of text into a numerical representation, known as an embedding, and modern improvements to vector search focus on optimising speed and predictive accuracy. This is often achieved through neural methods that aim to learn language semantics. However, our results suggest that these are not always the best solution. Our task was to classify rigidly-structured medical documents according to their content, and we found that using off-the-shelf semantic vector search produced slightly worse predictive accuracy than creating a bespoke lexical vector search model, and that it required significantly more time to execute. These findings suggest that traditional methods deserve to be contenders in the information retrieval toolkit, despite the prevalence and success of neural models.</description>

      <title>PoisonArena: Uncovering Competing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, widely used to improve the factual grounding of large language models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject manipulated content into the retriever's corpus. While prior research has predominantly focused on single-attacker settings, real-world scenarios often involve multiple, competing attackers with conflicting objectives. In this work, we introduce PoisonArena, the first benchmark to systematically study and evaluate competing poisoning attacks in RAG. We formalize the multi-attacker threat model, where attackers vie to control the answer to the same query using mutually exclusive misinformation. PoisonArena leverages the Bradley-Terry model to quantify each method's competitive effectiveness in such adversarial environments. Through extensive experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, we demonstrate that many attack strategies successful in isolation fail under competitive pressure. Our findings highlight the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) and F1 score and underscore the need for competitive evaluation to assess real-world attack robustness. PoisonArena provides a standardized framework to benchmark and develop future attack and defense strategies under more realistic, multi-adversary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) encounters efficiency challenges when scaling to massive knowledge bases while preserving contextual relevance. We propose Hash-RAG, a framework that integrates deep hashing techniques with systematic optimizations to address these limitations. Our queries directly learn binary hash codes from knowledgebase code, eliminating intermediate feature extraction steps, and significantly reducing storage and computational overhead. Building upon this hash-based efficient retrieval framework, we establish the foundation for fine-grained chunking. Consequently, we design a Prompt-Guided Chunk-to-Context (PGCC) module that leverages retrieved hash-indexed propositions and their original document segments through prompt engineering to enhance the LLM's contextual awareness. Experimental evaluations on NQ, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves a 90% reduction in retrieval time compared to conventional methods while maintaining considerate recall performance. Additionally, The proposed system outperforms retrieval/non-retrieval baselines by 1.4-4.3% in EM scores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering and evaluating long-form talk content such as videos and podcasts poses a significant challenge for users, as it requires a considerable time investment. Previews offer a practical solution by providing concise snippets that showcase key moments of the content, enabling users to make more informed and confident choices. We propose an LLM-based approach for generating podcast episode previews and deploy the solution at scale, serving hundreds of thousands of podcast previews in a real-world application. Comprehensive offline evaluations and online A/B testing demonstrate that LLM-generated previews consistently outperform a strong baseline built on top of various ML expert models, showcasing a significant reduction in the need for meticulous feature engineering. The offline results indicate notable enhancements in understandability, contextual clarity, and interest level, and the online A/B test shows a 4.6% increase in user engagement with preview content, along with a 5x boost in processing efficiency, offering a more streamlined and performant solution compared to the strong baseline of feature-engineered expert models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.</description>

      <title>SPOT-Trip: Dual-Preference Driven Out-of-Town Trip Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-town trip recommendation aims to generate a sequence of Points of Interest (POIs) for users traveling from their hometowns to previously unvisited regions based on personalized itineraries, e.g., origin, destination, and trip duration. Modeling the complex user preferences--which often exhibit a two-fold nature of static and dynamic interests--is critical for effective recommendations. However, the sparsity of out-of-town check-in data presents significant challenges in capturing such user preferences. Meanwhile, existing methods often conflate the static and dynamic preferences, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we for the first time systematically study the problem of out-of-town trip recommendation. A novel framework SPOT-Trip is proposed to explicitly learns the dual static-dynamic user preferences. Specifically, to handle scarce data, we construct a POI attribute knowledge graph to enrich the semantic modeling of users' hometown and out-of-town check-ins, enabling the static preference modeling through attribute relation-aware aggregation. Then, we employ neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to capture the continuous evolution of latent dynamic user preferences and innovatively combine a temporal point process to describe the instantaneous probability of each preference behavior. Further, a static-dynamic fusion module is proposed to merge the learned static and dynamic user preferences. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, showing that SPOT-Trip achieves performance improvement by up to 17.01%.</description>

Abstract: Given a semi-structured knowledge base (SKB), where text documents are interconnected by relations, how can we effectively retrieve relevant information to answer user questions? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as "hybrid" questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.</description>

      <title>TACLR: A Scalable and Efficient Retrieval-based Method for Industrial Product Attribute Value Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial deployment. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Further, it has been successfully deployed on the real-world e-commerce platform Xianyu, processing millions of product listings daily with frequently updated, large-scale attribute taxonomies. We release the code to facilitate reproducibility and future research at https://github.com/SuYindu/TACLR.</description>

      <title>ViDoRAG: Visual Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Dynamic Iterative Reasoning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/ViDoRAG.</description>

      <title>DRAMA: Diverse Augmentation from Large Language Models to Smaller Dense Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong effectiveness and robustness while fine-tuned as dense retrievers. However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Dense Retrievers: Short, Early, and Literal Biases Outranking Factual Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense retrieval models are commonly used in Information Retrieval (IR) applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since they often serve as the first step in these systems, their robustness is critical to avoid downstream failures. In this work, we repurpose a relation extraction dataset (e.g., Re-DocRED) to design controlled experiments that quantify the impact of heuristic biases, such as a preference for shorter documents, on retrievers like Dragon+ and Contriever. We uncover major vulnerabilities, showing retrievers favor shorter documents, early positions, repeated entities, and literal matches, all while ignoring the answer's presence! Notably, when multiple biases combine, models exhibit catastrophic performance degradation, selecting the answer-containing document in less than 10% of cases over a synthetic biased document without the answer. Furthermore, we show that these biases have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, where retrieval-preferred documents can mislead LLMs, resulting in a 34% performance drop than providing no documents at all. https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohsenfayyaz/ColDeR</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven E-Commerce Marketing Content Optimization: Balancing Creativity and Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As e-commerce competition intensifies, balancing creative content with conversion effectiveness becomes critical. Leveraging LLMs' language generation capabilities, we propose a framework that integrates prompt engineering, multi-objective fine-tuning, and post-processing to generate marketing copy that is both engaging and conversion-driven. Our fine-tuning method combines sentiment adjustment, diversity enhancement, and CTA embedding. Through offline evaluations and online A/B tests across categories, our approach achieves a 12.5 % increase in CTR and an 8.3 % increase in CVR while maintaining content novelty. This provides a practical solution for automated copy generation and suggests paths for future multimodal, real-time personalization.</description>

      <title>Improving Dialogue State Tracking through Combinatorial Search for In-Context Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.</description>
