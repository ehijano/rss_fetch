      <title>Engaging and Educating Eclipse Observers Through Workshops, Media, Planetarium shows and Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heliophysics Big Year was an extended year where major solar events engaged the public. It included two eclipses (annular on October 14, 2023 and total on April 8, 2024), plus solar max and the Parker Solar Probe perihelion December 24, 2024. After the eclipse of 2017, many millions more Americans planned to view the solar corona. We expanded our eclipse website with activities, citizen science projects, resources, training videos, equipment, and external links. We were the Southwest Regional Coordinator for Citizen CATE 2024 project, training the state coordinators and their teams with the equipment and procedures. We trained teachers at local, regional, national, and international workshops, providing eclipse viewing cards, lenses to make solar cup projectors, a safe viewing screen pattern, and access to the training materials. We made presentations to the media and hosted public events to demonstrate safe eclipse viewing techniques. HMNS hosted live viewing for the annular and total plus solstice and equinox events, reaching tens of thousands of people. HMNS also secured a grant to provide 100 eclipse viewing cards for every public school (8,800+) in Texas. We distributed another 57,000 eclipse viewers to teachers and the public. We appeared in media both in advance of the eclipses and as live commentators. The most lasting and impactful product was our planetarium show Totality, which was given away free and shown in various formats (flatscreen, fisheye, or prewarped). Over 180,000 views of the show and its animations have been documented. We continued to improve our space weather forecasting site, which correctly predicted the major solar storms of May 10-11 and October 8-10, 2024. In total, we reached nearly two million learners.</description>

      <title>Ion-neutral chemistry at icy moons: the case of Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Icy moons orbiting giant planets are often described as airless bodies though they host an exosphere where collisions between neutral species are scarce. In the case of Ganymede, the neutral composition is dominated by $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$. Past observations by Galileo showed that Ganymede hosts an ionosphere and those by Juno revealed the presence of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$, an ion species only stemming from ion-neutral collisions. $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ detection suggests that ions and neutrals might still collide and be the source of new ion species on icy moons. We examine Ganymede's ability to host a more diverse ionosphere in terms of ion composition than previously thought and predict its variety. We upgraded our test-particle code of Ganymede's ionosphere, formerly collisionless, to include ion-neutral collisions in a probabilistic manner. The updated code is applied to three Galileo flybys of Ganymede that were investigated in the absence of chemistry. Both sets of simulations have been compared and the effect of ion-neutral chemistry has been assessed. We show that in the case of an exosphere predominantly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$, the ionosphere is made not only of their associated cations but also of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$, $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$, and $\mathrm{O_2H^+}$. Simulations reveal that, depending on the location, the contribution of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ and $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ to the ion composition may be significant. Strong dayside/nightside and Jovian/anti-Jovian asymmetries in the ion composition are identified. Our findings are key to interpreting Juno and future JUICE ion mass spectrometer datasets.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric/ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</description>

      <title>Magnitude of Short-Wavelength Electric Field Fluctuations in Simulations of Collisionless Plasma Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-amplitude electrostatic fluctuations are routinely observed by spacecraft upon traversal of collisionless shocks in the heliosphere. Kinetic simulations of shocks have struggled to reproduce the amplitude of such fluctuations, complicating efforts to understand their influence on energy dissipation and shock structure. In this paper, 1D particle-in-cell simulations with realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio are used to show that in cases with upstream electron temperature $T_e$ exceeding the ion temperature $T_i$, the magnitude of the fluctuations increases with the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, reaching realistic values at $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce} \gtrsim 30$. The large-amplitude fluctuations in the simulations are shown to be associated with electrostatic solitary structures, such as ion phase-space holes. In the cases where upstream temperature ratio is reversed, the magnitude of the fluctuations remains small.</description>
