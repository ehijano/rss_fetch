      <title>Maximal toroids and Cartan subgroups of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified theory of Cartan subgroups and maximal toroids - defined as connected multiplicative type subgroups that are maximal amongst all such subgroups - which holds for all affine algebraic groups over a field, regardless of smoothness. For instance we show that maximal toroids always exist, that they are invariant under base change, and that they are in natural 1-1 correspondence with Cartan subgroups. Our results generalise known results for Cartan subgroups and maximal tori of smooth affine algebraic groups, as well as their analogues for restricted Lie algebras. We conclude with some applications to, and a brief discussion of, some generation problems for algebraic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lift to the multivariate Eulerian polynomials the identity implying that univariate Eulerian polynomials are palindromic. As a consequence of this generalization, we obtain nice combinatorial identities that can be directly extracted from this polynomial relation and the bijection between permutations involved in the proof of the identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. For $p=2$, the fields of values of the complex irreducible characters of finite groups whose degrees are not divisible by $p$ have been classified; for odd primes $p$, a conjectural classification has been proposed. In this work, we extend this conjecture to characters whose degrees are divisible by arbitrary powers of $p$, and we provide some evidence supporting its validity.</description>

      <title>Fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1980, Odoni initiated the study of the fixed-point proportion of iterated Galois groups of polynomials motivated by prime density problems in arithmetic dynamics.
  The main goal of the present paper is to completely settle the longstanding open problem of computing the fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups of polynomials. Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics. This result has direct applications to the proportion of periodic points of polynomials over finite fields.
  The general framework developed in this paper applies more generally to rational functions over arbitrary fields and generalizes, via a unified approach, previous partial results, which have all been proved with very different methods.</description>

      <title>Uni-width subgroups, universal elements, and lambda number of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cyclic subgroup $N$ of a finite group $G$ is called a uni-width subgroup of $G$ if $N$ is the unique cyclic subgroup of $G$ of order $|N|$. In this article, we prove that a finite group $G$ admits a unique largest uni-width subgroup denoted by $U(1;G)$. We then show that the prime factors of the order of $U(1;G)$ influence the structure decomposition of its Fitting subgroup ${\mathrm{Fit}}(G)$. A power graph $\Gamma_G$ of a finite group is defined by $G$ being its set of vertices, and a pair of distinct elements $x,y \in G$ are connected by an edge if either $x \in \langle y \rangle$ or $y \in \langle x \rangle$. A universal element of a graph is a vertex that is adjacent to each of the remaining vertices. Our following result shows that a power graph $\Gamma_G$ of a finite non-trivial group admits a non-identity universal element if and only if it is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion $2$-group. The lambda number $\lambda(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is a measure of the least number of colors required for an $L(2,1)$-type of vertex coloring on $\Gamma_G$, which is known to be $\geq |G|$. Generalizing an earlier result, we then derive a necessary condition on a finite group $G$ such that $\lambda(G) = |G|$. Finally, we show that this result is best possible by exhibiting a family of groups without the necessary condition for which $\lambda(G) &gt; |G|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group scheme over a field $k$. We show there exists a unipotent normal subgroup of $G$ which contains all other such subgroups; we call it the restricted unipotent radical $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$ of $G$. We investigate some properties of $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$, and study those $G$ for which $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$ is trivial. In particular, we relate these notions to their well-known analogues for smooth connected affine $k$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a non-positively curved cube complex with hyperbolic fundamental group. We prove that $\pi_1(X)$ has a non-free subgroup of infinite index unless $\pi_1(X)$ is either free or a surface group, answering questions of Gromov and Whyte (in a special case) and Wise. A similar result for one-relator groups follows, answering a question posed by several authors. The proof relies on a careful analysis of free and cyclic splittings of cubulated groups.</description>

      <title>On Ulam widths of finitely presented infinite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental notion in group theory, which originates in an article of Ulam and von Neumann from $1947$ is uniform simplicity. A group $G$ is said to be $n$-uniformly simple for $n \in \mathbf{N}$ if for every $f,g\in G\setminus \{id\}$, there is a product of no more than $n$ conjugates of $g$ and $g^{-1}$ that equals $f$. Then $G$ is uniformly simple if it is $n$-uniformly simple for some $n \in \mathbf{N}$, and we refer to the smallest such $n$ as the Ulam width, denoted as $\mathcal{R}(G)$. If $G$ is simple but not uniformly simple, one declares $\mathcal{R}(G)=\infty$. In this article, we construct for each $n\in \mathbf{N}$, a finitely presented infinite simple group $G$ such that $n&lt;\mathcal{R}(G)&lt;\infty$. These are the first such examples among the class of finitely presented infinite simple groups. For the class of finitely generated (but not finitely presentable) infinite simple groups, the existence of such examples was settled in the work of Muranov. However, this had remained open for the class of finitely presented infinite simple groups. Our examples are also of type $F_{\infty}$, which means that they are fundamental groups of aspherical CW complexes with finitely many cells in each dimension. Uniformly simple groups are in particular uniformly perfect: there is an $n\in \mathbf{N}$ such that every element of the group can be expressed as a product of at most $n$ commutators of elements in the group. We also show that the analogous notion of width for uniform perfection is unbounded for our family of finitely presented infinite simple groups. To our knowledge, this is also the first such family.</description>

      <title>Some generalizations of Camina pairs and orders of elements in cosets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate certain generalizations of Camina pairs. Let $H$ be a nontrivial proper subgroup of a finite group $G$. We first show that every nontrivial irreducible complex character of $H$ induces homogeneously to $G$ if and only if for every $x\in G\setminus H$, the element $x$ is conjugate to $xh$ for all $h\in H$. Furthermore we prove that if $xh$ is conjugate to either $x$ or $x^{-1}$ for all $h\in H$ and all $x\in G\setminus H$, then the normal closure $N$ of $H$ in $G$ also satisfies the same condition, and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we determine the structure of $H$ under the assumption that for every element $x\in G\setminus H$ of odd order, the coset $xH$ consists entirely of elements of odd order.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness properties of some of Halls groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study a class of central extensions of $\mathbb{Z}\wr\mathbb{Z}$, as first described by Hall. On the one hand, we consider groups of this type with cyclic centre, our construction yields a rich class of groups. In particular we obtain a group that is conjugacy separable with solvable word problem but unsolvable conjugacy problem, we obtain a group with large conjugacy separability growth but small conjugator length function and residual finiteness growth, and we also obtain both a class of groups that for most functions $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ larger then $n^3$, contain a group $G$ such that the conjugator length of $G$ is given by $f$, as well as a group where the conjugator length is superlinear but subquadratic.
  On the other hand we also consider a different group with larger centre. This is the first example of a group where the residual finiteness growth is faster than any polynomial but slower than any exponential.</description>

      <title>On a generalisation of Cameron's base size conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant {\rm Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. A base for $G$ is a subset of $\Omega$ whose pointwise stabiliser is trivial, and the minimal cardinality of a base is called the base size of $G$, denoted by $b(G, \Omega)$. Equivalently, $b(G, \Omega)$ is the minimal positive integer $k$ such that $G$ has a regular orbit on the Cartesian product $\Omega^k$. A well-known conjecture of Cameron from the 1990s asserts that if $G$ is an almost simple primitive group and $H$ is a so-called non-standard subgroup, then $b(G, \Omega) \leqslant 7$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the Mathieu group ${\rm M}_{24}$ in its natural action of degree $24$. This conjecture was settled in a series of papers by Burness et al. (2007-11).
  In this paper, we complete the proof of a natural generalisation of Cameron's conjecture. Our main result states that if $G$ is an almost simple group and $H_1, \ldots, H_k$ are any non-standard maximal subgroups of $G$ with $k \geqslant 7$, then $G$ has a regular orbit on $G/H_1 \times \cdots \times G/H_k$, noting that Cameron's original conjecture corresponds to the special case where the $H_i$ are pairwise conjugate subgroups. In addition, we show that the same conclusion holds with $k = 6$, unless $G = {\rm M}_{24}$ and each $H_i$ is isomorphic to ${\rm M}_{23}$. For example, this means that if $G$ is a simple exceptional group of Lie type and $H_1, \ldots, H_6$ are proper subgroups of $G$, then there exist elements $g_i \in G$ such that $\bigcap_i H_i^{g_i} = 1$. By applying recent work in a joint paper with Burness, we may assume $G$ is a group of Lie type and our proof uses probabilistic methods based on fixed point ratio estimates.</description>

Abstract: We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</description>

      <title>Crossed product splitting of intermediate operator algebras via 2-cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the C*-algebra inclusions $B \subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ arising from inclusions $B \subset A$ of $\Gamma$-C*-algebras. The main result shows that, when $B \subset A$ is C*-irreducible in the sense of R{\o}rdam, and is centrally $\Gamma$-free in the sense of the author, then after tensoring with the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$, all intermediate C*-algebras $B \subset C\subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ enjoy a natural crossed product splitting \[\mathcal{O}_2\otimes C=(\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes D) \rtimes_{{\rm r}, \gamma, \mathfrak{w}} \Lambda\] for $D:= C \cap A$, some $\Lambda&lt;\Gamma$, and a subsystem $(\gamma, \mathfrak{w})$ of a unitary perturbed cocycle action $\Lambda \curvearrowright \mathcal{O}_2\otimes A$. As an application, we give a new Galois's type theorem for the Bisch--Haagerup type inclusions \[A^K \subset A\rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma\] for actions of compact-by-discrete groups $K \rtimes \Gamma$ on simple C*-algebras.
  Due to a K-theoretical obstruction, the operation $\mathcal{O}_2\otimes -$ is necessary to obtain the clean splitting. Also, in general 2-cocycles $\mathfrak{w}$ appearing in the splitting cannot be removed even further tensoring with any unital (cocycle) action. We show them by examples, which further show that $\mathcal{O}_2$ is a minimal possible choice.
  We also establish a von Neumann algebra analogue, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ is replaced by the type I factor $\mathbb{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb{N}))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general technique to construct tight fusion frames with prescribed symmetries. Applying this technique with a prescription for "all the symmetries", we construct a new family of equi-isoclinic tight fusion frames (EITFFs), which consequently form optimal Grassmannian codes. By virtue of their construction, our EITFFs have the remarkable property of total symmetry: any permutation of subspaces can be achieved by an appropriate unitary.</description>
