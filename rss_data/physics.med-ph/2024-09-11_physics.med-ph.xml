      <title>Initial Experience of Metabolic Imaging with Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRI in Kidney Transplant Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. Early detection of allograft injury is important to delay or prevent irreversible damage. PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of hyperpolarized (HP) [1-13C]pyruvate MRI for assessing kidney allograft metabolism. SUBJECTS: 6 participants (mean age, 45.2 +- 12.4 years, 2 females) scheduled for kidney allograft biopsy and 5 patients (mean age, 59.6 +- 10.4 years, 2 females) with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). ASSESSMENT: Five of the six kidney allograft participants underwent biopsy after MRI. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine protein-to-creatine ratio (uPCR) were collected within 4 weeks of MRI. Kidney metabolism was quantified from HP [1-13C]pyruvate MRI using the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in allograft kidneys and non-tumor bearing kidneys from RCC patients. RESULTS: Biopsy was performed a mean of 9 days (range 5-19 days) after HP [1-13C]pyruvate MRI. Three biopsies were normal, one showed low-grade fibrosis and one showed moderate microvascular inflammation. All had stable functioning allografts with eGFR &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and normal uPCR. One participant who did not undergo biopsy had reduced eGFR of 49 mL/min/1.73 m2 and elevated uPCR. The mean lactate-to-pyruvate ratio was 0.373 in participants with normal findings (n = 3) and 0.552 in participants with abnormal findings (n = 2). The lactate-to-pyruvate ratio was highest (0.847) in the participant with reduced eGFR and elevated uPRC. Native non-tumor bearing kidneys had a mean lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of 0.309. DATA CONCLUSION: Stable allografts with normal findings at biopsy showed lactate-to-pyruvate ratios similar to native non-tumor bearing kidneys, whereas allografts with abnormal findings showed higher lactate-to-pyruvate ratios.</description>

      <title>Water Absorption Dynamics in Medical Foam: Empirical Validation of the Lucas-Washburn Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extends the Lucas-Washburn theory through non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis to examine fluid absorption in medical foams used for hemorrhage control. As a universal model for capillary flow in porous media, the theory demonstrated strong agreement with experimental results, confirming its semi-quantitative accuracy. Minor deviations, likely due to material heterogeneity, were observed and explained, enhancing the theory's applicability to real-world conditions. Our findings underscore the universality of the Lucas-Washburn framework and provide valuable insights for optimizing the design of medical foams, ultimately contributing to more effective bleeding control solutions in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised stratification of patients with myocardial infarction based on imaging and in-silico biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel methodology for stratifying post-myocardial infarction patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias using patient-specific 3D cardiac models derived from late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) images. The method integrates imaging and computational simulation with a simplified cellular automaton model, Arrhythmic3D, enabling rapid and accurate VA risk assessment in clinical timeframes. Applied to 51 patients, the model generated thousands of personalized simulations to evaluate arrhythmia inducibility and predict VA risk. Key findings include the identification of slow conduction channels (SCCs) within scar tissue as critical to reentrant arrhythmias and the localization of high-risk zones for potential intervention. The Arrhythmic Risk Score (ARRISK), developed from simulation results, demonstrated strong concordance with clinical outcomes and outperformed traditional imaging-based risk stratification. The methodology is fully automated, requiring minimal user intervention, and offers a promising tool for improving precision medicine in cardiac care by enhancing patient-specific arrhythmia risk assessment and guiding treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Development of Advanced FEM Simulation Technology for Pre-Operative Surgical Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracorporeal needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) offers a minimally invasive approach for the thermal ablation of malignant brain tumors, including both primary and metastatic cancers. NBTU utilizes a high-frequency alternating electric field to excite a piezoelectric transducer, generating acoustic waves that cause localized heating and tumor cell ablation, and it provides a more precise ablation by delivering lower acoustic power doses directly to targeted tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Building on our previous work, this study introduces a database for optimizing pre-operative surgical planning by simulating ablation effects in varied tissue environments and develops an extended simulation model incorporating various tumor types and sizes to evaluate thermal damage under trans-tissue conditions. A comprehensive database is created from these simulations, detailing critical parameters such as CEM43 isodose maps, temperature changes, thermal dose areas, and maximum ablation distances for four directional probes. This database serves as a valuable resource for future studies, aiding in complex trajectory planning and parameter optimization for NBTU procedures. Moreover, a novel probe selection method is proposed to enhance pre-surgical planning, providing a strategic approach to selecting probes that maximize therapeutic efficiency and minimize ablation time. By avoiding unnecessary thermal propagation and optimizing probe angles, this method has the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline surgical procedures. Overall, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the field of NBTU, offering a robust framework for enhancing treatment precision and efficacy in clinical settings.</description>
