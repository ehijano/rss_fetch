      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around $10^6\,M_\odot/\textrm{pc}^3$ across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Repeated Partial Tidal Disruptions and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions in SwJ023017.0+283603</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SwJ023017.0+283603 (SwJ0230) exhibited soft X-ray (0.3-1.0 keV) eruptions recurring roughly every 22 days. We present results from an extended monitoring campaign of SwJ0230 using Swift, NICER, and deep XMM-Newton observations. Our main findings are: 1) SwJ0230 did not display any eruptions during two 80-day periods (June-September 2023 and July-September 2024) of high-cadence monitoring with NICER and Swift, suggesting that the eruptions have ceased, implying an eruption lifetime of less than 536 days; 2) quiescent/non-eruption emission is detected with XMM-Newton, with a 0.3-2.0 keV luminosity of 4$\times$10$^{40}$ erg/s (bolometric luminosity of $&lt;$0.1% Eddington assuming a black hole mass of 10$^{6-7}$ M$_{\odot}$), that is consistent with a thermal disk spectrum peaking at 0.11$^{+0.06}_{-0.03}$ keV; 3) SwJ0230 exhibited multiple, rapid eruptions (duration$&lt;$5 hours, similar to quasi-periodic eruptions; QPEs), and there is tentative evidence that they recur, on average, on roughly the same timescale of 22 days. \target therefore exhibited (when active) both rapid, QPE-like outbursts and longer-duration outbursts, more akin to those from repeating partial Tidal Disruption Event (rpTDE) candidates. These findings are difficult to explain with existing models that invoke an orbiter interacting with a persistent disk and those involving disk instabilities. We propose a hybrid model wherein an object of smaller mass (e.g., a Jupiter-sized planet) being repeatedly partially stripped and subsequently punching through its own, fallback-induced disk, can explain many of the observed properties, including the long-duration flares (from accretion), the short-duration outbursts (from the planet-disk interaction), and the turn-off of the flares (when the planet is totally stripped of gas).</description>

      <title>Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of the transitional millisecond pulsar candidate 3FGL J1544.6-1125</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are neutron-star systems that alternate between a rotation-powered radio millisecond pulsar state and an accretion-disk-dominated low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB)-like state on multi-year timescales. During the LMXB-like state, the X-ray emission from tMSPs switches between "low" and "high" X-ray brightness modes on a timescale of seconds to minutes (or longer), while the radio emission shows variability on timescales of roughly minutes. Coordinated VLA and Chandra observations of the nearby tMSP PSR J1023+0038 uncovered a clear anti-correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities such that the radio emission consistently peaks during the X-ray low modes. In addition, there are sometimes also radio/X-ray flares that show no obvious correlation. In this paper, we present simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of a promising tMSP candidate system, 3FGL J1544.6-1125, which shows optical, gamma-ray, and X-ray phenomena similar to PSR J1023+0038, but which is challenging to study because of its greater distance. Using simultaneous VLA and Chandra observations we find that the radio and X-ray emission are consistent with being anti-correlated in a manner similar to PSR J1023+0038. We discuss how our results help in understanding the origin of bright radio emission from tMSPs. The greater sensitivity of upcoming telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array will be crucial for studying the correlated radio/X-ray phenomena of tMSP systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic 3D Simulation of Roche Lobe Overflow in High-mass X-Ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While binary merger events have been an active area of study in both simulations and observational work, the formation channels by which a high-mass star extends from Roche lobe overflow (RLO) in a decaying orbit of a black-hole (BH) companion to a binary black-hole (BBH) system merits further investigation. Variable length-scales must be employed to accurately represent the dynamical fluid transfer and morphological development of the primary star as it conforms to a diminishing Roche lobe under the runaway influence of the proximal BH. We have simulated and evolved binary mass flow under these conditions to better identify the key transitional processes from RLO to BBHs. We demonstrate a new methodology to model RLO systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow (f = 1.1) to be entirely conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport, forming a conical L1 tidal stream of density and deflected angle comparable to existing predictions. This case lies within the unstable mass transfer (MT) regime as recently proposed of M33 X-7. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating nonconservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The nonconservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semidetached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize their role and distribution as progenitors of BBHs and common envelopes.</description>

      <title>A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.</description>

      <title>SMBH binary candidate PKS J2134-0153: Possible multi-band periodic variability and inter-band time lags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the periodic flux-variation behavior of blazars is vital for probing supermassive black hole binaries and the kinematics of relativistic jets. In this work, we report the detection of the multi-band possible periodic variations of the blazar PKS J2134-0153, including the infrared ($1.6(\pm0.4)\times 10^3$ days) and optical ($1.8(\pm1)\times 10^3$ days). The periods in the infrared and optical bands are statistically consistent with the period in the radio band ($P_{\mathrm{Radio}}$$ = 1760\pm33$ days, obtained from our previous work). Moreover, flux variations in different bands are correlated with evident inter-band time delays, and the time lags of infrared and optical emission with respect to radio emission are $(3.3\pm2.3)\times10^{2}$ days and $(3.0\pm2.3)\times10^{2}$ days, respectively. The cross-correlations indicate a common origin of radio, infrared, and optical emission. The relative positions between emission regions of infrared and optical emission to radio emission are estimated according to the time lags, i.e., $0.37\pm0.26$ pc and $0.33\pm0.26$ pc. The relative distances seem to be quantitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction.</description>

      <title>A neutrino flare associated with X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where stars are captured or tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes, are potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. We report the discovery of a potential neutrino flare that is spatially and temporally associated with X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp. The best-fit spectrum of the neutrino flare follows a power-law with an index of $\rm{\gamma=2.7\pm0.4}$ and a flux normalization of $\rm{\Phi_0 =1.7^{+6.3}_{-1.5}\times 10^{-18}\;GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$ at 100 TeV based on an analysis of 10-year track data from IceCube, and the flare duration is 61 days. We calculate that the probability of this association occurring by chance is $0.17\%$. Therefore, ATLAS17jrp is the second TDE (not including candidates) associated with high-energy neutrinos, following TDE AT2019dsg associated with an IceCube neutrino alert. This association can be attributed to the interaction of X-ray photons produced by the hot corona with high-energy particles accelerated by disk winds or outflows, resulting in the production of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Deep drilling in the time domain with DECam II: characterizing the light curves of candidates in the extragalactic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second paper on the DECam deep drilling field (DDF) program we release 2,020 optical gri-band light curves for transients and variables in the extragalactic COSMOS and ELAIS fields based on time series observations with a 3-day cadence from semester 2021A through 2023A. In order to demonstrate the wide variety of time domain events detected by the program and encourage others to use the data set, we characterize the sample by presenting a brief analysis of the light curve parameters such as time span, amplitude, and peak brightness. We also present preliminary light curve categorizations, and identify potential stellar variables, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, supernovae (such as Type Ia, Type IIP, superluminous, and gravitationally lensed supernovae), and fast transients. Where relevant, the number of identified transients is compared to the predictions of the original proposal. We also discuss the challenges of analyzing DDF data in the context of the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will include DDFs. Images from the DECam DDF program are available without proprietary period and the light curves presented in this work are publicly available for analysis.</description>

      <title>Pulsed and Polarized X-ray Emission from Neutron Star Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields of neutron stars naturally lead to strong anisotropy and polarization of radiation emanating from their surfaces, both being sensitive to the hot spot position on the surface. Accordingly, pulse phase-resolved intensities and polarizations depend on the angle between the magnetic and spin axes and the observer's viewing direction. In this paper, results are presented from a Monte Carlo simulation of neutron star atmospheres that uses a complex electric field vector formalism to treat polarized radiative transfer due to magnetic Thomson scattering. General relativistic influences on the propagation of light from the stellar surface to a distant observer are taken into account. The paper outlines a range of theoretical predictions for pulse profiles at different X-ray energies, focusing on magnetars and also neutron stars of lower magnetization. By comparing these models with observed intensity and polarization pulse profiles for the magnetar 1RXS J1708-40, and the light curve for the pulsar PSR J0821-4300, constraints on the stellar geometry angles and the size of putative polar cap hot spots are obtained.</description>

      <title>Proof of Shock-cloud interaction within parts of $\gamma$-Cygni region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze 15 yr data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in a region around supernova remnant (SNR) $\gamma$-Cygni from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and find that the spectra of two extended sources associated with the southeast radio SNR arc and the TeV VERITAS source can be described well by single power-laws with photon indices of $2.149\pm0.005$ and $2.01\pm0.06$, respectively. Combining with high resolution gas observation results, we model the emission in the hadronic scenario, where the $\gamma$-ray emission could be interpreted as escaped CRs illuminating a surrounding Molecular Cloud (MC) plus an ongoing shock-cloud interaction component. In this scenario, the difference between these two GeV spectral indices is due to the different ratios of the MC mass between the escaped component and the trapped component in the two regions. We further analyze, in a potential pulsar halo region, the relationship between energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$, spin-down power $\dot{E}$, and the $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma}$ of PSR J2021+4026. Our results indicate that the existence of a pulsar halo is unlikely. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty on the SNR distance, the derived energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$ might be overestimated, thus the scenario of a SNR and a pulsar halo overlapping in the direction of the line of sight (LOS) cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Candidate Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Periodic Mid-Infrared Light Curves of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06902v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1,268 to 2,437 days (in the observer frame) by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we found no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace-Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins such as SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Study of the muon component in the core-corona model using CONEX 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between models and data on the muon content in air showers generated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays still needs to be solved. The CONEX simulation framework provides a flexible tool to assess the impact of different interaction properties and address the muon puzzle. In this work, we present the multidimensional extension of CONEX and show its performance compared to CORSIKA by discussing muon-related air-shower features for three experiments: KASCADE, IceTop, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We also implement an effective version of the core-corona model to demonstrate the impact of the core effect, as observed at the LHC, on the muon content in air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At a primary energy of $E_0 = 10^{19}$ eV, we obtain an increase of $15\%$ to $20\%$ in the muon content.</description>

      <title>Flaring gamma-ray emission coincident with a hyperactive fast radio burst source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright milliseconds-duration radio bursts from cosmological distances. Despite intense observational and theoretical studies, their physical origin is still mysterious. One major obstacle is the lack of identification of multi-wavelength counterparts for FRBs at cosmological distances. So far, all the searches other than in the radio wavelength, including those in the gamma-ray energies, have only left upper limits. Here we report a gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray flare lasting 15.6 seconds as well as additional evidence of variable gamma-ray emission in temporal and spatial association with the hyper-active, newly discovered repeating FRB 20240114A, which has been localized to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of 0.13. The energetic, short GeV gamma-ray flare reached a prompt isotropic luminosity of the order of ${10}^{48}~{\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. The additional less-significant gamma-ray flares, if true, also have similar luminosities; such flares could contribute to a 5-day average luminosity of the order of ${10}^{45}~{\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. These high-luminosity flares challenge the traditional FRB engine scenario involving a seconds-period magnetar. Rather, it suggests a powerful, long-lived, but newborn energy source at the location of this active repeater, either directly powering the bursts or indirectly triggering bursts in the vicinity of the FRB engine.</description>

      <title>Inferring jet physics from neutron star - black hole mergers with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01 solar masses at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13 degrees at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.</description>

      <title>Search for Extended GeV Sources in the Inner Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of extended $\gamma$-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars is interpreted as inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons by electron-positron pairs escaping the pulsar wind nebula, which are confined near the system by unclear mechanisms. This emerging population of $\gamma$-ray sources was first discovered at TeV energies and remains underexplored in the GeV range. To address this, we conducted a systematic search for extended sources along the Galactic plane using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data above 10 GeV, aiming to identify a number of pulsar halo candidates and extend our view to lower energies. The search covered the inner Galactic plane ($\lvert l\rvert\leq$ 100$^{\circ}$, $\lvert b\rvert\leq$ 1$^{\circ}$) and the positions of known TeV sources and bright pulsars, yielding broader astrophysical interest. We found 40 such sources, forming the Second Fermi Galactic Extended Sources Catalog (2FGES), most with 68% containment radii smaller than 1.0$^{\circ}$ and relatively hard spectra with photon indices below 2.5. We assessed detection robustness using field-specific alternative interstellar emission models and by inspecting significance maps. Noting 13 sources previously known as extended in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog and five dubious sources from complex regions, we report 22 newly detected extended sources above 10 GeV. Of these, 13 coincide with H.E.S.S., HAWC, or LHAASO sources; six coincide with bright pulsars (including four also coincident with TeV sources); six are associated with 4FGL point sources only; and one has no association in the scanned catalogs. Notably, six to eight sources may be related to pulsars as classical pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos.</description>

      <title>Constraints to the inert doublet model of dark matter with very high-energy gamma-rays observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics featuring a scalar dark matter candidate, using data from recent and future gamma-ray observatories. The relevance of the model for indirect searches of dark matter stems from two key features: first, in the high-mass regime, IDM can achieve the correct dark matter relic abundance for masses between approximately 500 GeV and 25 TeV, aligning perfectly with the energy sensitivity of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Second, this regime is dominated by co-annihilation processes, which elevate the thermal-relic velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section to the range of 0.5 $-$ 1.0$\times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, thereby enhancing the potential gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation. Analyzing recent H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Center region, we find that dark matter particle masses within the 1 to 8 TeV range are excluded by current data. Furthermore, we project that the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will comprehensively probe the remaining viable parameter space of the IDM. Our findings are further examined in the context of the most recent theoretical constraints, collider searches, and direct detection results from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Propagation in Starobinsky Inflationary Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we linearize the field equations in the $f(R)$ theory using the Starobinsky model, $R+R^2/(6m^2)$, and explore the impact of modifications to the gravitational field equations on the propagation and structure of gravitational waves. An equation for the trace of the perturbation was then derived and decomposed with the aid of an auxiliary field that obeyed the pure wave equation and was sourced by the matter-energy distribution, while also acting as a fictitious source for generating the actual perturbation via the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green's functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. This trace value was then substituted into the linearized field equation to determine the perturbation tensor in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. We subsequently calculated the components of the quadrupole moment tensor as well as the perturbation tensor for a binary star system and compared them to the General Relativity case. The results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the orbital parameters, specifically: the angular frequency and radius of the system. This suggests that high-frequency binary systems could be promising candidates for detecting the effects of this modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in relativistic cold asymmetric nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter. We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gleeok's Fire-breathing: Triple Flares of AT 2021aeuk within Five Years from the Active Galaxy SDSS J161259.83+421940.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a noteworthy transient AT 2021aeuk exhibiting three distinct optical flares between 2018 and 2023. It is hosted in a radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, with an optical image showing a minor tidal morphology and a red mid-infrared color W1-W2=1.1. Flares II and III exhibit rapid rises, and long-term decays (around 1000 days) with recurring after-peak bumps. The g-r color after subtracting the reference magnitude exhibited a rapid drop and recovery during Flare II, followed by the minor after-peak evolution in blue colors. We applied a canonical tidal disruption event (TDE) fitting on the light curves which gives a decay index p of $-2.99_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$ for Flare II and $-1.61_{-0.65}^{+0.34}$ for Flare III. The blackbody fitting shows lower temperatures ($\sim 10^{3.8}$K) with minor after-peak evolution. The blackbody radius ($\gtrsim 10^{16}\ \rm cm$) and luminosity ($\sim 10^{45}\rm erg\ s^{-1}$) are larger than the typical TDE sample's. The time lag (in rest frame) between ZTF g- and r-band ($\rm \tau_{g,r}=3.4^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$ days) significantly exceeds the prediction from the standard accretion disk. Pre-burst spectra reveal prominent Bowen fluorescence lines, indicating a vigorous or potentially long-lasting process that enriches the local metallicity. Additionally, we derived black hole masses of $\log\it{M}_{\bullet}\rm=7.09^{+0.18}_{-0.31}\ \it{M}_{\odot}$ and $\log\it{M}_{\bullet}\rm=7.52^{+0.08}_{-0.10}\ \it{M}_{\odot}$ using $\rm H\beta$ and $\rm H\alpha$ emission lines. The variation and recurring features of AT 2021aeuk are not likely induced by the radio-beaming effect or Type-II superluminous supernova (SLSN-II), however, we cannot rule out the possibility of TDE or enhanced active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion process. The unusually high occurrence of three flares within five years may also induced by the complex local environment.</description>

      <title>Recovering pulsar periodicity from time of arrival data by finding the shortest vector in a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strict periodicity of pulsars is the primary source of information we have to learn about their nature and environment, it allows us to challenge general relativity and measure gravitational waves. Identifying such a periodicity from a discrete set of arrival times is a difficult algorithmic problem, particularly when the pulsar is in a binary system. This challenge is especially acute in $\gamma$-ray pulsar astronomy as there are hundreds of unassociated Fermi-LAT sources awaiting a timing solution that will reveal their nature, and may allow adding them to pulsar timing arrays. The same issue arises when attempting to recover a strict periodicity for repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Such a detection would be a major breakthrough, providing us with the FRB source's age, magnetic field, and binary orbit.
  The problem of recovering a timing solution from sparse time-of-arrival (TOA) data is currently unsolvable for pulsars in binary systems and incredibly hard even for single pulsars. In a series of papers, we will develop an algorithmic set of tools that will allow us to solve the timing recovery problem under different regimes. In this paper, we frame the timing recovery problem as the problem of finding a short vector in a lattice and obtain the solution using off-the-shelf lattice reduction and sieving techniques. As a proof of concept, we solve PSR J0318+0253, a millisecond $\gamma$-ray pulsar discovered by FAST in a $\gamma$-ray directed search, in a few CPU-minutes. We discuss the assumptions of the standard lattice techniques and quantify their performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Zone Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback in 3D GRMHD: Bridging Vast Spatial and Temporal Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating accretion and feedback from the horizon scale of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out to galactic scales is challenging because of the vast range of scales involved. Elaborating on \citet{Cho2023}, we describe and test a ``multi-zone'' technique which is designed to tackle this difficult problem in 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. While short-timescale variability should be interpreted with caution, the method is demonstrated to be well-suited for finding dynamical steady-states over a wide dynamic range. We simulate accretion on a non-spinning SMBH ($a_*=0$) using initial conditions and the external galactic potential from a large scale galaxy simulation, and achieve steady state over 8 decades in radius. As found in \citet{Cho2023}, the density scales with radius as $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ inside the Bondi radius $R_B$, which is located at $R_B=2\times 10^5 \,r_g$ ($\approx 60\,{\rm pc}$ for M87) where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the SMBH; the plasma-$\beta\sim$ unity, indicating an extended magnetically arrested state; the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is $\approx 1\%$ of the analytical Bondi accretion rate $\dot{M}_B$; and there is continuous energy feedback out to $\approx 100R_B$ (or beyond $&gt;\,{\rm kpc}$) at a rate $\approx 0.02 \dot{M}c^2$. Surprisingly, no ordered rotation in the external medium survives as the magnetized gas flows to smaller radii, and the final steady solution is very similar to when the exterior has no rotation. Using the multi-zone method, we simulate GRMHD accretion over a wide range of Bondi radii, $R_{\rm B} \sim 10^2 - 10^7\,r_{\rm g}$, and find that $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\approx (R_B/6\, r_g)^{-0.5}$.</description>

Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states of pulsar emission under the quantum refraction effects, combined with the dependence on the emission frequency; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed frequency of emission, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviors. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations.</description>

Abstract: Pulse Profile Modeling (PPM), the technique used to infer mass, radius and geometric parameters for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), relies on relativistic ray-tracing of thermal X-ray photons from hot spots on the neutron star surface to the observer. To verify our ray-tracing codes we have in the past conducted cross-tests for simple hot spot geometries, focusing primarily on the implementation of the space-time model. In this paper, we present verification for test problems that explore the more complex hot spot geometries that are now being employed in the NICER PPM analyses. We conclude that the accuracy of our computed waveforms is in general sufficiently high for analyses of current NICER data sets. We have however identified some extreme configurations where extra care may be needed.</description>

      <title>Merger Precursor: Year-long Transients Preceding Mergers of Low-mass Stripped Stars with Compact Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</description>

      <title>Triggering the Untriggered: The First Einstein Probe-Detected Gamma-Ray Burst 240219A and Its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe (EP) achieved its first detection and localization of a bright X-ray flare, EP240219a, on 2024 February 19, during its commissioning phase. Subsequent targeted searches triggered by the EP240219a alert identified a faint, untriggered gamma-ray burst (GRB) in the archived data of Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and Insight-HXMT/HE. The EP Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) light curve reveals a long duration of approximately 160 s with a slow decay, whereas the Fermi/GBM light curve shows a total duration of approximately 70 s. The peak in the Fermi/GBM light curve occurs slightly later with respect to the peak seen in the EP/WXT light curve. Our spectral analysis shows that a single cutoff power-law (PL) model effectively describes the joint EP/WXT--Fermi/GBM spectra in general, indicating coherent broad emission typical of GRBs. The model yielded a photon index of $\sim -1.70 \pm 0.05$ and a peak energy of $\sim 257 \pm 134$ keV. After detection of GRB 240219A, long-term observations identified several candidates in optical and radio wavelengths, none of which was confirmed as the afterglow counterpart during subsequent optical and near-infrared follow-ups. The analysis of GRB 240219A classifies it as an X-ray rich GRB (XRR) with a high peak energy, presenting both challenges and opportunities for studying the physical origins of X-ray flashes, XRRs, and classical GRBs. Furthermore, linking the cutoff PL component to nonthermal synchrotron radiation suggests that the burst is driven by a Poynting flux-dominated outflow.</description>

      <title>The early radio afterglow of short GRB 230217A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the radio afterglow of short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 230217A, which was detected less than 1 day after the gamma-ray prompt emission with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The ATCA rapid-response system automatically triggered an observation of GRB 230217A following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and began observing the event just 32 minutes post-burst at 5.5 and 9 GHz for 7 hours. Dividing the 7-hour observation into three time-binned images allowed us to obtain radio detections with logarithmic central times of 1, 2.8 and 5.2 hours post-burst, the first of which represents the earliest radio detection of any GRB to date. The decline of the light curve is consistent with reverse shock emission if the observing bands are below the spectral peak and not affected by synchrotron self-absorption. This makes GRB 230217A the fifth short GRB with radio detections attributed to a reverse shock at early times ($&lt;1$ day post-burst). Following brightness temperature arguments, we have used our early radio detections to place the highest minimum Lorentz factor (${\Gamma}_{min} &gt; 50$ at $\sim1$ hour) constraints on a GRB in the radio band. Our results demonstrate the importance of rapid radio follow-up observations with long integrations and good sensitivity for detecting the fast-evolving radio emission from short GRBs and probing their reverse shocks.</description>

      <title>Search for echoes on the edge of quantum black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I perform a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation (or Boltzmann echoes) by combining the gravitational wave data from 47 binary black hole merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With a Bayesian inference approach, I found no statistically significant evidence for this signal in either of the 3 Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2 and GWTC-3. While the data does not provide definitive evidence against the presence of Boltzmann echoes, the Bayesian evidence for most events falls within the range of 0.3-1.6, with the hypothesis of a common (non-vanishing) echo amplitude for all mergers being weakly disfavoured at 2:5 odds. The only exception is GW190521, the most massive and confidently detected event ever observed, which shows a positive evidence of 9.2 for stimulated Hawking radiation. The ''look-elsewhere'' effect for this outlier event is assessed by applying two distinct methods to add simulated signals in real data, before and after the event, giving false (true) positive detection probabilities for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$, $4.4^{+2.0}_{-2.0} \%$ ($35 \pm 7 \%$, $35 \pm 15 \%$). An optimal combination of posteriors yields an upper limit of $A &lt; 0.4$ (at 90\% confidence level) for a universal echo amplitude, whereas $A \sim 1$ was predicted in the canonical model. To ensure the robustness of the results, I have employed an additional method to combine the events hierarchically. This approach involves using a target gaussian distribution and extracting the parameters from multiple uncertain observations, which may be affected by selection biases.</description>

      <title>A Cigale module tailored (not only) for Low-Luminosity AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral energy distribution (SED) of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) presents challenges due to their faint emissions and the complexity of their accretion processes. This study introduces a new CIGALE module tailored for LLAGN, combining the empirical $L_X$-$L_{12\mu m}$ relationship with physical models like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and truncated accretion disks. This module yields a refined depiction of LLAGN emissions, and a mock analysis shows reliable parameter recovery, with only minor biases.
  We tested the module on a sample of 50 X-ray-detected local galaxies, including LINERs and Seyferts, where it demonstrated good estimation of bolometric luminosities, even in the presence of significant galaxy contamination. Notably, the previous X-ray module failed to provide AGN solutions for this sample, stressing the need for a novel approach. Comparisons with mid-luminosity AGN confirm the module's robustness and applicability to AGN up to $L_X$ &lt; $10^{45}$ erg/s. We also expanded the X-ray to bolometric correction formula, making it applicable to AGN spanning ten orders of magnitude in luminosity, and revealing lower $k_X$ values than typically assumed. Additionally, our analysis of the $\alpha_{ox}$ index, representing the slope between UV and X-ray emissions, uncovered trends that differ from those observed in high-luminosity AGN, suggesting a shift in accretion physics and photon production mechanisms in low-luminosity regimes.
  These results underscore the importance of a multiwavelength approach in AGN studies and reveal distinct behaviors in LLAGN compared to quasars. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of LLAGN and offer a comprehensive framework for future research aimed at completing the census of the AGN population.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass black hole binary parameter estimation with next-generation ground-based detector networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios for the formation and evolution of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the mass range $10^2 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$ remain uncertain, but future ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers will probe the lower end of the IMBH mass range. We study the detectability of IMBH binary mergers and the measurability of their parameters with next-generation ground-based detector networks consisting of various combinations of Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometers. We find that, for binaries with component masses $m_{1,2}\sim 1000\,M_\odot$, an optimal 3-detector network can constrain the masses with errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ ($\lesssim 1\%$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2$), and the source redshift can be measured with percent-level accuracy or better at $z\lesssim 2$. The redshift of lighter binaries ($m_{1,2}\lesssim 300\,M_\odot$) can still be measured with $O(10)\%$ accuracy even at $z=10$. Binaries with $z\lesssim 0.5$ can be localized within $1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for $m_{1,2}\lesssim 1000\,M_\odot$, and within $0.1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for comparable mass systems. The sky localization is good enough that it may be possible to cross-correlate GW searches with galaxy catalogs and to search for electromagnetic counterparts to IMBH mergers. We also point out that the low-frequency sensitivity of the detectors is crucial for IMBH detection and parameter estimation. It will be interesting to use our results in conjunction with population synthesis codes to constrain astrophysical IMBH formation models.</description>

      <title>Multi-spectral Sirens: Gravitational-wave Cosmology with (Multi-) Sub-populations of Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational-wave (GW) data of the compact binary mergers by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so-called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual subpopulations, and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different subpopulations. In this work we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with subpopulations of GW events, named multi-spectral sirens. The advantage of the multi-spectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens is demonstrated by the simulation with the mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields $H_0=73.3^{+29.9}_{-25.6}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (median and symmetric 68.3\% credible interval), which is about 19\% tighter than the result inferred with the traditional spectral sirens utilizing a PowerLaw+Peak mass function. The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in [10,200] (log-uniform prior in [20,140]) ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ gives $H_0=71.1^{+15.0}_{-7.5}~(70.3^{+12.9}_{-7.1})~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (68.3\% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of $\sim26\%$ (23\%) with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.</description>

      <title>A New IW And-Type Star: Karachurin 12 with Tilted Disks and Diverse cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IW And-type phenomenon in cataclysmic variables presents a significant challenge to the accretion disk instability model. Using photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we identify Karachurin 12 as a new non-eclipsing IW And-type object with a cycle period of 35.69(3) days. We also report for the first time that Karachurin 12 is a negative superhump (NSH) system featuring a precessing tilted disks, with precession, orbital, and NSH periods of 4.9588(2) days, 0.3168895(13) days, and 0.2979861(8) days, respectively. Our analysis, using dips as index and NSHs as probe, reveals diverse cycle patterns in Karachurin 12, with NSH amplitude varying throughout the cycle. These findings offer new insights for studying tilted disks and the IW And-type phenomenon. The mass-transfer burst model has difficulty explaining the observed variations in NSH amplitude, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the origin of the mass transfer burst. Meanwhile, the tilted thermally unstable disk model indicates a possible connection to the IW And-type phenomenon, but it also struggles to account for the detailed variations in Karachurin 12. Therefore, a wider range of factors must be considered to fully understand the complex changes in Karachurin 12.</description>

Abstract: A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.</description>

Abstract: Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the local dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</description>
