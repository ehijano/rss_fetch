      <title>Solving the Wave Equation on Discrete Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to an initial value problem for the 1-dimensional wave equation on time scales through the application of a Fourier transform and its inverse via contour integrals. The time scale of the spatial dimension is set to the integers and a broader class of discrete time scales, while the time dimension is set to the positive real numbers.</description>

Abstract: In \cite{CJ1} M. Jaoua et al. studied the linear approximation of Robin problem on $\Omega$ an open bounded domain of $\R^d$, and they given some important results. In this paper, we study a nonlinear approximation of an elliptic problem with a nonlinear Robin boundary condition in a domain of $\R^2$.

      <title>Existence of weak martingale solutions to a stochastic fluid-structure interaction problem with a compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of weak martingale solutions to a stochastic moving boundary problem arising from the interaction between an isentropic compressible fluid and a viscoelastic structure. In the model, we consider a three-dimensional compressible isentropic fluid with adiabatic constant $\gamma &gt; 3/2$ interacting dynamically with an elastic structure on the boundary of the fluid domain described by a plate equation, under the additional influence of stochastic perturbations which randomly force both the compressible fluid and elastic structure equations in time. The problem is nonlinearly coupled in the sense that the a priori unknown (and random) displacement of the elastic structure from its reference configuration determines the a priori unknown (and random) time-dependent fluid domain on which the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations are posed. We use a splitting method, consisting of a fluid and structure subproblem, to construct random approximate solutions to an approximate Galerkin form of the problem with artificial viscosity and artificial pressure. We introduce stopped processes of structure displacements which handle the issues associated with potential fluid domain degeneracy. In this splitting scheme, we handle mathematical difficulties associated with the a priori unknown and time-dependent fluid domain by using an extension of the fluid equations to a fixed maximal domain and we handle difficulties associated with imposing the no-slip condition in the stochastic setting by using a novel penalty term defined on an external tubular neighborhood of the moving fluid-structure interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-posedness result for stochastic fluid-structure interaction with compressible fluids.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>

      <title>Threshold property of a singular stationary solution for semilinear heat equations with exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N\ge 3$. We are concerned with a Cauchy problem of the semilinear heat equation \[ \begin{cases} \partial_tu-\Delta u=f(u), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^N,\ t&gt;0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases} \] where $f(0)=0$, $f$ is nonnegative, increasing and convex, $\log f(u)$ is convex for large $u&gt;0$ and some additional assumptions are assumed. We establish a positive radial singular stationary solution $u^*$ such that $u^*(x)\to\infty$ as $|x|\to 0$. Then, we prove the following: The problem has a nonnegative global-in-time solution if $0\le u_0\le u^*$ and $u_0\not\equiv u^*$, while the problem has no nonnegative local-in-time solutions if $u_0\ge u^*$ and $u_0\not\equiv u^*$.</description>

      <title>A new class of anisotropic double phase problems: exponents depending on solutions and their gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce two novel classes of quasilinear elliptic equations, each driven by the double phase operator with variable exponents. The first class features a new double phase equation where exponents depend on the gradient of the solution. We delve into proving various properties of the corresponding Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces, including the $\Delta_2$ property, uniform convexity, density and compact embedding. Additionally, we explore the characteristics of the new double phase operator, such as continuity, strict monotonicity, and the (S$_+$)-property. Employing both variational and nonvariational methods, we establish the existence of solutions for this inaugural class of double phase equations. In the second category, the treatment of exponents is dependent on the solution itself. This class differs from the first one due to the unavailability of suitable Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces. For this reason, we employ a perturbation argument that leads to the classical double phase class. These two new classes highlight how different physical processes like the movement of special fluids through porous materials, phase changes, and fluid dynamics interact with each other. Our results are novel in this context and includes a self-contained techniques.</description>

      <title>On the large amplitude solution of the Boltzmann equation with large external potential and boundary effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation is a fundamental equation in kinetic theory that describes the motion of rarefied gases. In this study, we examine the Boltzmann equation within a $C^1$ bounded domain, subject to a large external potential $\Phi(x)$ and diffuse reflection boundary conditions. Initially, we prove the asymptotic stability of small perturbations near the local Maxwellian $\mu_E (x,v)$. Subsequently, we demonstrate the asymptotic stability of large amplitude solutions with initial data that is arbitrarily large in (weighted) $L^\infty$, but sufficiently small in the sense of relative entropy. Specifically, we extend the results for large amplitude solutions of the Boltzmann equation (with or without external potential) [10, 11, 12, 23] to scenarios involving significant external potentials [19, 28] under diffuse reflection boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Properties of Solutions of Semilinear Elliptic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article explores the qualitative properties of solutions to elliptic equations and systems, focusing particularly on whether solutions retain the symmetry of their domains. According to the well-known Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg theorem, positive solutions to certain autonomous elliptic equations in radial domains are radial themselves. However, this symmetry can be broken in equations with power weight terms. The article also examines related results for systems of these weighted equations.</description>

      <title>On the energy-constrained optimal mixing problem for one-dimensional initial configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of mixing a passive scalar in a periodic box by incompressible vector fields subject to a fixed energy constraint. In that setting a lower bound for the time in which perfect mixing can be achieved has been given by Lin, Thiffeault, Doering \cite{Lin_Thiffeault_Doering_2011}. While examples by Depauw \cite{Depauw} and Lunasin et al. \cite{Lunasin_etal_2012} show that perfect mixing in finite time is indeed possible, the question regarding the sharpness of the lower bound from \cite{Lin_Thiffeault_Doering_2011} remained open. In the present article we give a negative answer for the special class of initial configurations depending only on one spatial coordinate. The new lower bound holds true for distributional solutions satisfying only the uniform energy constraint for the velocity field and a weak compatibility condition for the passive scalar coming from the transport equation. In that weak setting we also provide an example for which the new bound is sharp. As a new ingredient in the investigation of optimal mixing we utilize the convex hull inequalities of the transport equation with constraints when seen as a differential inclusion.</description>

      <title>Construction of weak solutions to the equations of a compressible viscous model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims on the construction of weak solutions to equations of a model of compressible viscous fluids, being a simplification of the classical compressible Navier-Stokes system. We present a novel scheme for approximating systems that preserves structural integrity by avoiding classical regularization with $ - \varepsilon \Delta \varrho $, thus maintaining the transport character of the continuity equation. Our approach, which necessitates specific conditions on the constitutive equation, accommodates physically relevant models such as isentropic and van der Waals gases, and globally handles non-monotone pressures. From an analytical perspective, our method synthesizes techniques from Feireisl-Lions and Bresch-Jabin to demonstrate the convergence of approximate densities using compensated compactness techniques. We also apply renormalization of the continuity equations and utilize weight techniques to manage unfavorable terms.</description>

      <title>Unified quantitative analysis of the Stokes equations in dilute perforated domains via layer potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified method to obtain the quantitative homogenization of Stokes systems in periodically perforated domains with no-slip boundary conditions on the perforating holes. The main novelty of our paper is a quantitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the two-scale cell correctors via periodic Stokes layer potentials. The two-scale cell correctors were introduced and analyzed qualitatively by Allaire in the early 90's. Thanks to our layer potential approach, we also provide a novel explanation of the conductivity matrix in Darcy's model, of the Brinkman term in Brinkman's model, and explain the special behavior for $d=2$. Finally, we also prove quantitative homogenization error estimates in various regimes of ratios between the size of the perforating holes and the typical distance between holes. In particular we handle a subtle issue in the dilute Darcy regime related to the non-vanishing of the Darcy velocity on the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in rotating spherical coordinates. After establishing global-in-time existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, we turn our attention to the issue of stability of a class of steady zonal solutions (i.e., time-independent solutions that vary only with latitude). By identifying suitable conserved quantities and combining them to construct a Lyapunov function, we prove a stability result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a shift theorem for solutions of the Poisson equation in a finite planar cone (and hence also on plane polygons) for Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. The range in which the shift theorem holds depends on the angle of the cone. For the right endpoint of the range, the shift theorem is described in terms of Besov spaces rather than Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hyperbolic-Elliptic Systems in the Bounded Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article we study a hyperbolic-elliptic system of PDE. The system can describe two different physical phenomena: 1st one is the motion of magnetic vortices in the II-type superconductor and 2nd one \ is the collective motion of cells. Motivated by real physics, we consider this system with boundary conditions, describing the flux of vortices (and cells, respectively) through the boundary of the domain. We prove the global solvability of this problem.\ To show the solvability result we use a "viscous" parabolic-elliptic system. Since the viscous solutions do not have a compactness property, we justify the limit transition on a vanishing viscosity, using a kinetic formulation of our problem. As the final result of all considerations we have solved a very important question related with a so-called "boundary layer problem", showing the strong convergence of the viscous solutions to the solution of our hyperbolic-elliptic system.</description>

      <title>Monge-Kantorovich Fitting With Sobolev Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the ``best'' approximation of an $n$-dimensional probability measure $\rho$ using a measure $\nu$ whose support is parametrized by $f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ where $m &lt; n$. We quantify the performance of the approximation with the Monge-Kantorovich $p$-cost (also called the Wasserstein $p$-cost) $\mathbb{W}_p^p(\rho, \nu)$, and constrain the complexity of the approximation by bounding the $W^{k,q}$ Sobolev norm of $f$, which acts as a ``budget.'' We may then reformulate the problem as minimizing a functional $\mathscr{J}_p(f)$ under a constraint on the Sobolev budget.
  We treat general $k \geq 1$ for the Sobolev differentiability order (though $q, m$ are chosen to restrict $W^{k,q}$ to the supercritical regime $k q &gt; m$ to guarantee existence of optimizers). The problem is closely related to (but distinct from) principal curves with length constraints when $m=1, k = 1$ and smoothing splines when $k &gt; 1$. New aspects and challenges arise from the higher order differentiability condition.
  We study the gradient of $\mathscr{J}_p$, which is given by a vector field along $f$ we call the barycenter field. We use it to construct improvements to a given $f$, which gives a nontrivial (almost) strict monotonicty relation between the functional $\mathscr{J}_p$ and the Sobolev budget. We also provide a natural discretization scheme and establish its consistency. We use this scheme to model a generative learning task; in particular, we demonstrate that adding a constraint like ours as a soft penalty yields substantial improvement in training a GAN to produce images of handwritten digits, with performance competitive with weight-decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extends the celebrated volume-capacity estimates of Dinew and Kolodziej, providing a foundation for examining the regularity of solutions to boundary value problems for complex Hessian equations. By integrating the techniques established by Dinew and Kolodziej and incorporating recent advances by Charabati and Zeriahi, we demonstrate the continuity of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Generalized solutions to hyperbolic systems with random field coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses linear hyperbolic systems in one space dimension with random field coefficients. In many applications, a low degree of regularity of the paths of the coefficients is required, which is not covered by classical stochastic analysis. For this reason, we place our analysis in the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. We obtain new characterizations of Colombeau stochastic processes and establish existence and uniqueness of solutions in this framework. A number of applications to stochastic wave and transport equations are given and the Colombeau solutions are related to classical weak solutions, when the latter exist.</description>

      <title>Developments of initial data on big bang singularities for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, Ringstr\"om proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringstr\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringstr\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.
  In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting.</description>

      <title>Scattering for non-radial 3D NLS with combined nonlinearities: the interaction Morawetz approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the scattering below the ground state energy level for a class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) with mass-energy intercritical competing nonlinearities. Specifically, the NLS has a focusing leading order nonlinearity with a defocusing perturbation. Our strategy combines interaction Morawetz estimates \`a la Dodson-Murphy and a new crucial bound for the Pohozaev functional of localized functions, which is essential to overcome the lack of a monotonicity condition. Furthermore, we give the rate of blow-up for symmetric solutions.</description>

      <title>Boundary H\"{o}lder continuity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic problems in $C^{1,1}$ domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article establishes the boundary H\"{o}lder continuity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic problems in the optimal range of dimensions $n \leq 9$, for $C^{1,1}$ domains. We consider equations $- L u = f(u)$ in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$, where $L$ is a linear elliptic operator with variable coefficients and $f \in C^1$ is nonnegative, nondecreasing, and convex. The stability of $u$ amounts to the nonnegativity of the principal eigenvalue of the linearized equation $- L - f'(u)$. Our result is new even for the Laplacian, for which [Cabr\'{e}, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)] proved the H\"{o}lder continuity in $C^3$ domains.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Estimates for Maxwell's Equations in the Exterior of a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to establish general principles for high frequency dispersive estimates for Maxwell's equation in the exterior of a perfectly conducting ball. We construct entirely new generalized eigenfunctions for the corresponding Maxwell propagator. We show that the propagator corresponding to the electric field has a global rate of decay in $L^1-L^{\infty}$ operator norm in terms of time $t$ and powers of $h$. In particular we show that some, but not all, polarizations of electromagnetic waves scatter at the same rate as the usual wave operator. The Dirichlet Laplacian wave operator $L^1-L^{\infty}$ norm estimate should not be expected to hold in general for Maxwell's equations in the exterior of a ball because of the Helmholtz decomposition theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness of reaction-diffusion steady states in general domains with Dirichlet boundary data. Here we consider "positive" (monostable) reactions. We describe geometric conditions on the domain that ensure uniqueness and we provide complementary examples of nonuniqueness. Along the way, we formulate a number of open problems and conjectures. To derive our results, we develop a general framework, the stable-compact method, to study qualitative properties of nonlinear elliptic equations.</description>

      <title>An $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity theory for parabolic equations with integro-differential operators having low intensity kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to parabolic equations with non-local operators $$ \partial_{t}u(t,x) = \mathcal{L}^{a}u(t,x) + f(t,x), \quad t&gt;0 $$ in $L_{q}(L_{p})$ spaces. Our spatial operator $\mathcal{L}^{a}$ is an integro-differential operator of the form $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \left( u(x+y)-u(x) -\nabla u(x) \cdot y \mathrm{1}_{|y|\leq 1} \right) a(t,y) j_{d}(|y|)dy. $$ Here, $a(t,y)$ is a merely bounded measurable coefficient, and we employed the theory of additive process to handle it. We investigate conditions on $j_{d}(r)$ which yield $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity of solutions. Our assumptions on $j_d$ are general so that $j_d(r)$ may be comparable to $r^{-d}\ell(r^{-1})$ for a function $\ell$ which is slowly varying at infinity. For example, we can take $\ell(r)=\log{(1+r^{\alpha})}$ or $\ell(r) = \min{\{r^{\alpha},1\}}$ ($\alpha\in(0,2)$). Indeed, our result covers the operators whose Fourier multiplier $\psi(\xi)$ does not have any scaling condition for $|\xi|\geq 1$. Furthermore, we give some examples of operators, which cannot be covered by previous results where smoothness or scaling conditions on $\psi$ are considered.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Chemotactic Singularity via Viscous Flow with Large Buoyancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes equation with low Reynolds number and subject to large buoyancy force. We show that for initial cell density with arbitrarily large mass (i.e. the $L^1$ norm), the solution remains regular for all times in the regime of sufficiently large buoyancy and viscosity. The major blowup suppression mechanism is a norm-stabilizing property possessed by a ``static problem,'' where the full problem can be seen as a perturbation of this quasi-stationary model.</description>

      <title>Perron solutions and boundary regularity for nonlocal nonlinear Dirichlet problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nonlinear operators of fractional $p$-Laplace type, we consider two types of solutions to the nonlocal Dirichlet problem: Sobolev solutions based on fractional Sobolev spaces and Perron solutions based on superharmonic functions. These solutions give rise to two different concepts of regularity for boundary points, namely Sobolev and Perron regularity. We show that these two notions are equivalent and we also provide several characterizations of regular boundary points. Along the way, we give a new definition of Perron solutions, which is applicable to arbitrary exterior Dirichlet data $g: \Omega^c \to [-\infty,\infty]$. We obtain resolutivity and invariance results for these Perron solutions, and show that the Sobolev and Perron solutions coincide for a large class of exterior Dirichlet data. A uniqueness result for the Dirichlet problem is also obtained for the class of bounded solutions taking prescribed continuous exterior data quasieverywhere on the boundary.</description>

      <title>On global dynamics of $3$-D irrotational compressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider global-in-time evolution of irrotational, isentropic, compressible Euler flow in $3$-D, for a broad class of $H^4$ classical Cauchy data without assuming symmetry, prescribed on an annulus surrounded by a constant state in the exterior. By giving a sufficient expansion condition on the initial data and using the nonlinear structure of the compressible Euler equations, we show that the decay rate of the first order transversal derivative of the normalized density is better than that of the same derivative of a free wave, provided that the perturbation arising from the tangential derivatives can be properly controlled for all $t$ by using a bootstrap argument. Building on this critical analysis, we construct global exterior solutions in $H^4$ for the broad class of data, with a rather general subclass forming rarefaction at null infinity. Our result does not require smallness on the transversal derivatives of classical data, thus applies to data with a total energy of any size.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the cubic 1D NLS with a slowly decaying potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an external potential $V$ that does not admit bound states. Assuming that $\jBra{x}^{2+}V(x) \in L^1$ and that $u$ is orthogonal to any zero-energy resonances, we show that solutions exhibit modified scattering behavior. Our decay assumptions are weaker than those appearing in previous work and are likely nearly optimal for exceptional potentials, since the M\o{}ller wave operators are not known to be bounded on $L^p$ spaces unless $\jBra{x}^2V \in L^1$.
  Our method combines two techniques: First, we prove a new class of linear estimates, which allow us to relate vector fields associated with the equation with potential to vector fields associated with the flat equation, up to localized error terms. By using the improved local decay coming from the zero-energy assumption, we can treat these errors perturbatively, allowing us to treat the weighted estimates using the same vector field arguments as in the flat case. Second, we derive the asymptotic profile using the wave packet testing method introduced by Ifrim and Tataru. Again, by taking advantage of improved local decay near the origin, we are able to treat the potential as a lower-order perturbation, allowing us to use tools developed to study the flat problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, under the exponential/polynomial decay condition in Fourier space, we prove that the nonlinear solution to the quasi-periodic Cauchy problem for the weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in higher dimensions will asymptotically approach the associated linear solution within a specific time scale. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis method present through diagrams. Our results and methods apply to {\em arbitrary} space dimensions and general power-law nonlinearities of the form $\pm|u|^{2p}u$, where $1\leq p\in\mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>Effective interface laws for fluid flow and solute transport through thin reactive porous layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a coupled model for fluid flow and transport in a domain consisting of two bulk regions separated by a thin porous layer. The thickness of the layer is of order $\varepsilon$ and the microscopic structure of the layer is periodic in the tangential direction also with period $\varepsilon$. The fluid flow is described by an instationary Stokes system, properly scaled in the fluid part of the thin layer. The evolution of the solute concentrations is described by a reaction-diffusion-advection equation in the fluid part of the domain and a diffusion equation (allowing different scaling in the diffusion coefficients) in the solid part of the layer. At the microscopic fluid-solid interface inside the layer nonlinear reactions take place. This system is rigorously homogenized in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, based on weak and strong (two-scale) compactness results for the solutions. These are based on new embedding inequalities for thin perforated layers including coupling to bulk domains. In the limit, effective interface laws for flow and transport are derived at the interface separating the two bulk regions. These interface laws enable effective mass transport through the membrane, which is also an important feature from an application point of view.</description>
