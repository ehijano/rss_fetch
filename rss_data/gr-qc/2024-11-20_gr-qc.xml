      <title>The H_0 Tension and Late Time Phenomena in f(T,\mathcal{T}) Gravity Framework: Role of H_0 Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the role of $H_0$ priors in describing $H_0$ tension and late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe in the framework of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity. The specific functional form of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$, where $T$ and $\mathcal{T}$ respectively denote the torsion scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, has the potential to show the $H_0$ tension and late-time accelerating behavior. The model parameter space has been obtained using multiple cosmological data sets such as cosmic chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia $PAN^+\&amp;SH0ES$, and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Also, we have incorporated the $H_0$ priors from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and HW. The analysis shows the ability of the model to replicate comparative performance with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model through AIC and BIC. From the results obtained, it has been observed that the inclusion of the BAO data set shifts the $H_0$ values lower as compared to that of the $CC+PAN^+\&amp;SH0ES$ data set, whereas the combination of HW prior favors higher $H_0$ values. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the model to different $H_0$ priors. The findings indicate that the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity model can provide an alternative approach to show cosmological tension and late-time cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>High-energy interactions of charged black holes in full general relativity I: Zoom-whirl orbits and universality with the irreducible mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate high-energy scattering of equal-mass, nonspinning black holes endowed with like charges in full general relativity while varying the impact parameter $b$. We show that electrodynamics does not suppress zoom-whirl orbits for at least charge-to-mass ratios $\lambda = 0.1, 0.4, 0.6$. However, we find that as $\lambda$ increases, the immediate merger and scattering thresholds defining the zoom-whirl regime move to smaller impact parameter $b/M_{\rm ADM}$, with $M_{\rm ADM}$ designating the binary black hole gravitational mass. This demonstrates that charge leaves observable imprints in key properties at energy scales where charge has negligible influence in head-on collisions. Additionally, we find that these threshold impact parameters become universal, i.e., charge-independent, when we normalize $b$ by the sum of the initial BH irreducible masses in the binary ($b/M_{\rm irr}$). This is the first explicit demonstration that the irreducible mass, which is proportional to the black hole areal radius, defines a fundamental gauge-invariant length scale governing horizon scale scattering events in the strong-field, dynamical spacetime regime.</description>

      <title>Shadows of generalised Hayward spacetimes : in vacuum and with plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hayward regular BH solution attempted to resolve the curvature singularity issue by entering the domain of non-singular spacetimes. Recently, Dutta Roy and Kar (Phys. Rev. D 106, 044028) expanded this solution to encompass a broader range of spacetimes. These spacetimes are constructed based on the Damour-Solodukhin prescription, which involves introducing different metric parameters in the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components of the original Hayward line element, and are characterized by two parameters ($\sigma, \kappa$). This generalization gives rise to both known and novel regular/singular BHs as well as various types of wormhole spacetimes. In this work, we explore the spacetimes that emerge for different values of ($\sigma, \kappa$) from the generalized Hayward metric, particularly focusing on their shadows in vacuum and when surrounded by plasma. Intriguingly, we observe the presence of both photon and anti-photon spheres for certain regular spacetimes. Our study highlights the differences in the shadows of different types of regular spacetime compared to those of the singular BH derived from the generalized Hayward metric and also sheds light on the impact of plasma on the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>Binary Black Hole Waveforms from High-Resolution GR-Athena++ Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and subsequent inference of binary black hole signals rely heavily on the accuracy of the waveform model employed. In the highly non-linear, dynamic, and strong-field regime near merger, these waveforms can only be accurately modeled through numerical relativity simulations. Considering the precision requirements of next-generation gravitational wave observatories, we present in this paper high-resolution simulations of four non-spinning quasi-circular binary black hole systems with mass ratios of 1, 2, 3, and 4, conducted using the GR-Athena++ code. We extract waveforms from these simulations using both finite radius and Cauchy characteristic extraction methods. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive error analysis to evaluate the accuracy and convergence of the waveforms. This dataset encompasses gravitational waves of the precision (self-mismatch) demanded by upcoming gravitational detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. The waveforms are publicly available on ScholarSphere, and represent the first set of waveforms of the new GR-Athena++ catalog.</description>

      <title>Non-local effective field theory in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous velocity deviation in the osculating planetary flyby attracts enough attention as a problem of General Relativity. In connection of rotating weak field massive source the Lense Thirring metric is diagonalized to find the equation of motion from action invariance Hamilton principle in pure relativistic theory. The computation for near Earth flyby shows energy anomaly over the asymptotic in and out velocity obeying Anderson's empirical formula.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes Sourced by Dark Matter in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence of wormholes within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, considering isotropic dark matter as the matter source. We examine three distinct density profiles and employ modified field equations along with stress-energy tensor conservation, applying suitable boundary conditions to derive traversable wormhole solutions. We confirm that each obtained solution meets the geometric requirements for wormholes and assess the regularity of these spacetimes by computing the Kretschmann scalar to ensure the absence of singularities. Through the stress-energy tensor, we analyze the conditions under which energy conditions may be violated in this model. We explore the geometry of these wormholes using embedding diagrams, and evaluate the stability of the solutions by examining the speed of sound. Lastly, we compute the amount of exotic matter necessary to sustain these structures using the Volume Integral Quantifier.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent and background-preserving gravity from an action: cosmological tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observational implications of a gravitational model wherein the gravitational constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ exhibit scale-dependent behavior at the perturbative level, while preserving the General Relativity (GR) field equations at the background. This model is motivated by the potential influence of large-scale (infrared) Renormalization Group (RG) corrections to gravity and is constructed upon an effective action incorporating a scale definition via Lagrange multipliers. We explore the effects of these modifications during the recombination epoch with particular focus on their impact on the structure of acoustic oscillations. Additionally, we perform a comprehensive parameter fitting analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave background (CMB), type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscilations (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortions(RSD). Our results indicate that the RG corrections here considered are consistent with the main predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and they slightly increase the uncertainties in the parameter estimations. Such small differences cannot be used to dismiss the current cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic gravastar as horizonless regular black hole spacetime and its images illuminated by thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connection between regular black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects was proposed in~\cite{Carballo-Rubio:2022nuj}. In this paper, we construct a model of a horizonless compact object, specifically an anisotropic gravastar with continuous pressure, that corresponds to regular black hole spacetime in the appropriate limit. The construction begins by modeling an equation of state that satisfies the anisotropic gravastar conditions and transitions to the de Sitter ($p=-\epsilon$) upon horizon formation. The spacetime structure is similar to the {\it Quantum Horizonless Compact Object} (QHCO) described in~\cite{Chen:2024ibc}. Within this model, we also generate images of the corresponding objects surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal that assuming that the emitting matter exists only outside the object, the inner light ring structure closely resembles that of the horizonless configuration of a regular black hole and the QHCO, yet it exhibits a distinct light ring structure compared to the thin-shell gravastar model. However, the opposite occurs when emitting matter is taken into account inside the object.</description>

      <title>Can We Detect Deviations from Einstein's Gravity in Black Hole Ringdowns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of gravitational waves emitted during the black hole ringdown relaxation phase, following the merger of a black hole binary, is a crucial target of gravitational wave astronomy. By considering causality constraints on the on-shell graviton three-point couplings within a weakly coupled gravity theory, we present arguments indicating that the contributions to the physics of linear and quadratic quasinormal modes from higher derivative gravity theories are either negligible or vastly suppressed for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Their spectrum and interactions are dictated solely by Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>Using time series to identify strongly-lensed gravitational waves with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a massive body between the Earth and a gravitational-wave source will produce the so-called gravitational lensing effect. In the case of strong lensing, it leads to the observation of multiple deformed copies of the initial wave. Machine-learning (ML) models have been proposed for identifying these copies much faster than optimal Bayesian methods, as will be needed with the detection rate of next-generation detector. Most of these ML models are based on a time-frequency representation of the data that discards the phase information. We introduce a neural network that directly uses the time series data to retain the phase, limit the pre-processing time and keep a one-dimensional input. We show that our model is more efficient than the base model used on time-frequency maps at any False Alarm Rate (FPR), up to $\sim 5$ times more for an FPR of $10^{-4}$. We also show that it is not significantly impacted by the choice of waveform model, by lensing-induced phase shifts and by reasonable errors on the merger time that induce a misalignment of the waves in the input.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Ordering Ambiguities in Weak Chern-Simons 4D Gravity and Metastability of the Condensate-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a 4D cosmological Running-Vacuum-type Model (RVM) of inflation that characterises string-inspired Chern-Simons (CS) gravity. It has been shown that inflation in such models is caused by a condensation of the gravitational CS (gCS) terms induced by primordial gravitational waves (GW), which leads to a linear-axion potential, thus breaking the shift symmetry, and lifting its periodicity (monodromy). We demonstrate here that this inflationary phase may be metastable, due to the existence of non-trivial imaginary parts of the gCS condensate. These imaginary parts are quantum effects, proportional to appropriate commutators of GW perturbations. As we stress, their existence is quantum-ordering-scheme dependent. We argue here in favor of a physical importance of such imaginary parts, which we compute to second order in the GW (tensor) perturbations in the framework of a specific gauge-fixed effective Lagrangian, within a (mean field) weak-quantum-gravity path integral approach. We pay specific attention to the various space-time boundary terms. We thus provide an estimate of the life time of inflation. On matching our results with the relevant inflationary phenomenology, we fix the quantum-ordering ambiguities, and obtain an order-of-magnitude constraint on the ratio of the string energy scale $M_s$ in this model to the (four-spacetime-dimensional) reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$, specifically, $M_s/M_{\rm Pl} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This is consistent with the corresponding estimate obtained in previous analyses by the authors in this framework, based on a dynamical-system approach to linear-axion RVM inflation. Finally, we examine the role of periodic modulations in the axion potential induced by non-perturbative stringy effects on the slow-roll inflationary parameters, and find compatibility with the cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Properties of white dwarf with anisotropic pressure in Rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of anisotropic white dwarf stars within the rainbow gravity adopting for matter content the Chandrasekhar model based on an ideal Fermi gas at zero temperature. We study in detail the effects of the anisotropic factor on stellar mass and radius, the speed of sound, and the relativistic adiabatic index in both radial and tangential directions. We find that causality is never violated, whereas the stability criterion based on the relativistic adiabatic index is not met when the objects are characterized by a positive anisotropic factor close to the Chandrasekhar limit. We present this significant observation here for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Holographic images of a charged black hole in Lorentz symmetry breaking massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, this paper investigates the holographic images of a charged black hole within the context of Lorentz symmetry breaking massive gravity. The photon rings, luminosity-deformed rings, or light points from various observational perspectives are obtained. We also study the influences of both the chemical potential and temperature on the Einstein ring. Unlike the previous work, which primarily examines the effect of chemical potential on ring radius at high temperatures and find no change in the radius with varying chemical potential, we also investigate the effect of chemical potential on the ring radius at low temperature besides at high temperature. Our findings indicate that at low temperatures, the photon ring radius decreases with increasing of chemical potential, while at high temperatures, the results are consistent with previous studies. Additionally, we explore the impact of the model parameter {\lambda} on the Einstein ring radius and find the the ring radius increases as the model parameter {\lambda} increases. More interestingly, for the large chemical potential, u = 1, the temperature dependence of the photon ring radius is reversed for {\lambda} = 2 and {\lambda} = 4. Conversely, for a small chemical potential u = 0.1, the temperature dependence of the Einstein ring stays the same as {\lambda} = 2 and {\lambda} = 4.</description>

      <title>Horizons of some asymptotically stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a class of dynamical spacetimes which are asymptotic as $t\to\infty$ to a stationary spacetime containing a horizon $\mathcal{H}_0$, we show the existence of a unique null hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ which is asymptotic to $\mathcal{H}_0$. This is a special case of a general unstable manifold theorem for perturbations of flows which translate in time and have a normal sink at an invariant manifold in space. Examples of horizons $\mathcal{H}_0$ to which our result applies include event horizons of subextremal Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes as well as event and cosmological horizons of subextremal Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes. In the Kerr(-Newman) case, we show that $\mathcal{H}$ is equal to the boundary of the black hole region of the dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Boulware vs. Regularity: Thoughts on Anomaly-Induced Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the vacuum state and its corresponding renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) in static horizonless regular spacetime in both two- and four-dimensions. Using the local field formulation of the anomaly-induced effective action, we show that the regularities of the spacetime and the RSET dictate the appropriate vacuum state. Furthermore, through a case study under the horizonless Bardeen-type spacetime, we demonstrate that the preferred vacuum state is not the Boulware vacuum, but a non-trivial one with a different RSET profile.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Emergent Cosmology: A Collection of Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse of anisotropic cylindrical shearfree fluids with new exact interior solutions of GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of shearfree gravitational collapse using cylindrically symmetric spacetimes whose interior is a non-rotating dissipative fluid bounded by a cylindrical hypersurface beyond which is an Einstein-Rosen vacuum exterior. We consider three different pressure configurations: axially, azimuthally, and radially directed, for which we find new exact interior solutions of the field equations. We show that the matching conditions cannot be satisfied by the fluid with radial pressure, while the axial and azimuthal cases with a lapse function depending only on the time coordinate do satisfy these constraints. We derive, for both cases, a sufficient condition for an emission of gravitational radiation from the interior towards the exterior, We therefore show that, at variance with what happens for spherical symmetry, in the simplified picture of an infinite cylinder of anisotropic shearfree matter, gravitational waves can be emitted during collapsing motion.</description>

      <title>End-of-the-World Branes and Inflationary Predictions for Rocky and Swampy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making cosmological predictions in a multiverse is a fundamental theoretical challenge. Assuming that (quasi-)de Sitter vacua are quantum mechanically described by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, we develop a detailed framework for making explicit anthropic predictions. A key challenge which we attempt to overcome arises because, almost unavoidably, cosmologies that asymptote to Minkowski space exist. We then apply our framework to predicting the scale of inflation. We find that, even if eternal inflation is allowed, our predictions depend on creation rates of universes from nothing. These, in turn, are highly sensitive to the existence of end-of-the-world branes. The rates for the creation of universes from nothing are the dominant ingredient for `Swampy Landscapes', which may have no metastable de Sitter vacua but only slow-roll solutions. In `Rocky Landscapes', where long-lived de Sitter vacua are abundant, tunneling rates between such vacua represent a further key factor for deriving predictions.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Quantum Singularities on a Cauchy Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities pose a long-standing puzzle in quantum gravity. Unlike Schwarzschild, a generic family of black holes gives rise to a Cauchy horizon on which, even in the Hartle-Hawking state, quantum observables such as $\langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ -- the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor -- can diverge, causing a breakdown of semiclassical gravity. Because they are diagnosed within quantum field theory (QFT) on a smooth background, these singularities may provide a better-controlled version of the spacetime singularity problem, and merit further study.
  Here, I highlight a mildness puzzle of Cauchy horizon singularities: the $\langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ singularity is significantly milder than expected from symmetry and dimensional analysis. I address the puzzle in a simple spacetime $W_P$, which arises universally near all black hole Cauchy horizons: the past of a codimension-two spacelike plane in flat spacetime. Specifically, I propose an extremely broad QFT construction in which, roughly speaking, Cauchy horizon singularities originate from operator insertions in the causal complement of the spacetime. The construction reproduces well-known outer horizon singularities (e.g., in the Boulware state), and remarkably, when applied to $W_P$, gives rise to a universal mild singularity structure for robust singularities, ones whose leading singular behavior is state-independent. I make non-trivial predictions for all black hole Cauchy horizon singularities using this, and discuss extending the results beyond robust singularities and the strict near Cauchy horizon limit.</description>

      <title>Coincident Multimessenger Bursts from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes are a key target for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, and excellent multi-messenger sources with gravitational waves. However, unique features of their electromagnetic emission that are needed to distinguish them from single supermassive black holes are still being established. Here, we conduct the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation of accretion onto eccentric binary black holes in full general relativity incorporating synchrotron radiation transport through their dual-jet. We show that the total accretion rate, jet Poynting luminosity, and the optically thin synchrotron emission exhibit periodicity on the binary orbital period, demonstrating explicitly, for the first time, that the binary accretion rate periodicity can be reflected in its electromagnetic signatures. Additionally, we demonstrate that during each periodic cycle eccentric binaries spend more time in a low emission state than in a high state. Furthermore, we find that the gravitational wave bursts from eccentric binaries are coincident with the bursts in their jet luminosity and synchrotron emission. We discuss how multimessenger observations of these systems can probe plasma physics in their jet.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Supernovae, their Equation of State Dependence and Ejecta Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within $\sim 1$ s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as black hole supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core-collapse until $20\text{-}50$ days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a $60$ M$_\odot$ zero-age main sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto-neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between $0.06\text{-}0.72\times 10^{51}$ erg with $21.8\text{-}23.3$ M$_\odot$ of ejecta, of which $0\text{-}0.018$ M$_\odot$ is $^{56}$Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find a more nuanced EOS dependence of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the equation of state of strange quark star: Perturbative QCD along with a density-dependent bag constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) using a Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative model combined with the latest Particle Data Group dataset. Given the energy scale present in compact stars, QCD perturbation theory alone may not fully explain their structure. To account for non-perturbative contributions, we incorporate a density-dependent effective bag parameter, $B$, and derive the equation of state (EOS) for strange quark matter (SQM). We start by demonstrating the limitations of EOSs with a constant $B$ in describing massive objects with $ M_{TOV}&gt; 2M_{\odot} $. Subsequently, we show that considering $B$ as a density-dependent function significantly changes the results. Our definition of $B$ includes two parameters determined by both theoretical and observational constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating a density-dependent $B$ into the perturbative EOS can yield SQSs with masses exceeding $2M_{\odot}$, while complying with gravitational wave constraints such as tidal deformability, and thermodynamic considerations, including stability conditions and speed of sound behavior. Specifically, we show that massive compact objects like PSR J0952-0607, PSR J2215+5135, PSR J0740+6620, and the secondary mass of GW190814 can be SQSs. Additionally, we compare our EOS with the EOS of the authors who use a generalized polytropic form with adjustable parameters and obtain an interesting result.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative gauge gravity theories with R-flux star products and Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization in algebraic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, and quantum gravity, QG, models naturally arise as star product and R-flux deformations considered in string/ M-theory. Such nonassociative and noncommutative geometric and quantum information theories were formulated on phase spaces defined as cotangent Lorentz bundles enabled with nonassociative symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics and nonlinear and linear connection structures. We outline the analytic methods and proofs that corresponding geometric flow evolution and dynamical field equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general off-diagonal forms. New classes of solutions describing nonassociative black holes, wormholes, and locally anisotropic cosmological configurations are constructed using such methods. We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky, BV, formalism for quantizing modified gravity theories, MGTs, involving twisted star products and semi-classical models of nonassociative gauge gravity with de Sitter/affine/ Poincar\'{e} double structure groups. Such theories can be projected on Lorentz spacetime manifolds in certain forms equivalent to GR or MGTs with torsion generalizations etc. We study the properties of the classical and quantum BV operators for nonassociative phase spaces and nonassociative gauge gravity. Recent results and methods from algebraic QFT are generalized to involve nonassociative star product deformations of the anomalous master Ward identity. Such constructions are elaborated in a nonassociative BV perspective and for developing non-perturbative methods in QG.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the trajectories of neutral particles in the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. After reduction by cyclic coordinates this problem reduces to investigating a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system that has no additional integral. A classification of regions of possible motion of a particle is performed according to the values of the momentum and energy integrals. Bifurcations of periodic solutions of the reduced system are analyzed using a Poincare map.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Anupam, Chowdhury, and Sen [arXiv:2308.00038] constructed the non-extremal saddle that reproduces the supersymmetric index of the BMPV black hole with three independent charges in the classical limit. This saddle solution is a finite temperature complex solution saturating the BPS bound. In this paper, we write this solution in a canonical form in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, thereby showing that it is supersymmetric. We also show that it exhibits the new form of attraction.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fefferman-Graham gauge and boundary Weyl structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Fefferman--Graham (FG) gauge offers a useful way to express asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, allowing a clear identification of their boundary structure. A known feature of this approach is that choosing a particular conformal representative for the boundary metric breaks explicitly the boundary scaling symmetry. Recent developments have shown that it is possible to generalize the FG gauge to restore boundary Weyl invariance by adopting the Weyl--Fefferman--Graham gauge. In this paper, we focus on three-dimensional gravity and study the emergence of a boundary Weyl structure when considering the most general AdS boundary conditions introduced by Grumiller and Riegler. We extend the holographic renormalization scheme to incorporate Weyl covariant quantities, identifying new subleading divergences appearing at the boundary. To address these, we introduce a new codimension-two counterterm, or corner term, that ensures the finiteness of the gravitational action. From here, we construct the quantum-generating functional, the holographic stress tensor, and compute the corresponding Weyl anomaly, showing that the latter is now expressed in a full Weyl covariant way. Finally, we discuss explicit applications to holographic integrable models and accelerating black holes. For the latter, we show that the new corner term plays a crucial role in the computation of the Euclidean on-shell action.</description>

      <title>Assessing Matched Filtering for Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet challenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of these signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely on excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the lack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational wave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a set of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a theoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse supernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the injected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our approach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\% of the signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at 2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal characteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further improvements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova gravitational-wave detection. We also present the open-source Python package SynthGrav used to generate the template bank.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Yang--Mills topology on four-dimensional triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 4D $SU(N)$ gauge theories coupled to gravity in the Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) approach, focusing on the topological classification of the gauge path-integral over fixed triangulations. We discretize the topological charge and, after checking the emergence of topology and the continuum scaling on flat triangulations, we show that topology emerges on thermalized triangulations only in the so-called $C$-phase of CDT, thus enforcing the link between such phase and semi-classical space-time. We also provide a tool to visualize the topological structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1006.1614v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First a review is given of Riemann-Cartan space-time and Einstein-Cartan gravity. This gives us the necessary tools to handle the SO(2,3) Yang-Mills gauge theory for gravity. Field equations are obtained from a Yang-Mills gauge field Lagrangian. From these field equations and the Bianchi identities the conservation laws for anti-de Sitter theory are derived. Possible solutions of the field equations are discussed. The only solution found for a RW-geometry with a perfect fluid matter content is the early universe.</description>

      <title>Measuring source properties and quasi-normal-mode frequencies of heavy massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laser-interferometer space antenna (LISA) will be launched in the mid 2030s. It promises to observe the coalescence of massive black-hole (BH) binaries with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) reaching thousands. Crucially, it will detect some of these binaries with high SNR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown stages. Such signals are ideal for tests of General Relativity (GR) using information from the whole waveform. Here, we consider astrophysically motivated binary systems at the high-mass end of the population observable by LISA, and simulate their signals using the newly developed multipolar effective-one-body model: \texttt{pSEOBNRv5HM}. The merger-ringdown signal in this model depends on the binary properties, and also on parameters that describe fractional deviations from the GR quasi-normal-mode (complex) frequencies of the remnant BH. Performing full Bayesian analyses, we assess to which accuracy LISA will be able to constrain deviations from GR in the ringdown signal when using information from the whole signal. We find that these deviations can typically be constrained to within $10\%$ and in the best cases to within $1\%$. We also show that with this model we can measure the binary masses and spins with great accuracy even for very massive BH systems with low SNR in the inspiral. We also probe the accuracy of the \texttt{SEOBNRv5HM} waveform family by performing synthetic injections of GR numerical-relativity waveforms. Using a novel method that we develop here to quantify the impact of systematic errors, we show that already for sources with SNR $\mathcal{O}(100)$, we would measure erroneous deviations from GR due to waveform model inaccuracies. One of the main sources of error is the mismodelling of the relative alignment between harmonics. Our results confirm the need for improving waveform models to perform tests of GR with high SNR binary BHs observed by LISA.</description>

      <title>Field equations and Noether potentials for higher-order theories of gravity with Lagrangians involving $\Box^i R$, $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to perform a systematical investigation on the field equations and Noether potentials for the higher-order gravity theories endowed with Lagrangians depending on the metric and the Riemann curvature tensor, together with $i$th ($i=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot$) powers of the Beltrami-d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ acting on the latter. We start with a detailed derivation of the field equations and the Noether potential corresponding to the Lagrangian $\sqrt{-g}L_R(R,\Box R,\cdot\cdot\cdot,\Box^m R)$ through the direct variation of the Lagrangian and a method based upon the conserved current. Next the parallel analysis is extended to a more generic Lagrangian $\sqrt{-g}L_{\text{Ric}}(g^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu},\Box R_{\mu\nu}, \cdot\cdot\cdot,\Box^m R_{\mu\nu})$, as well as to the generalization of the Lagrangian $\sqrt{-g}L_{\text{Ric}}$, which depends on the metric $g^{\mu\nu}$, the Riemann tensor $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ and $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$s. Finally, all the results associated to the three types of Lagrangians are extended to the Lagrangian relying on an arbitrary tensor and the variables via $\Box^i$ acting on such a tensor. In particular, we take into consideration of equations of motion and Noether potentials for nonlocal gravity models. For Lagrangians involving the variables $\Box^i R$, $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, our investigation provides their concrete Noether potentials and the field equations without the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Besides, the Iyer-Wald potentials associated to these Lagrangians are also presented.</description>

      <title>Accreting Schwarzschild-like compact object: Plasma-photon interaction and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion is a common phenomenon associated with any astrophysical compact object, which is best described by plasma, a state of matter composed of electrons and heavy ions. In this paper, we analyze the linear dynamics of electromagnetic (EM) fields propagating through the accreting plasma around static and spherically symmetric horizon-less, exotic compact objects (ECOs). The general equations governing the propagation of EM waves in such a background exhibit quasi-bound states whose characteristic frequencies differ from the BH values for both the axial and the polar modes, as well as for homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma distributions. Moreover, the real and imaginary parts of these quasi-bound frequencies depict an oscillatory behaviour with the plasma frequency, characteristic of the ECOs considered. The amplitude of these oscillations depends on the non-zero reflectivity of the surface of the compact object, while the oscillation length depends on its compactness. This results in slower decay of the quasi-bound states with time for a certain parameter space of the plasma frequency, compared to BHs, making these ECOs more prone to instabilities.</description>

      <title>Strong-lensing cosmography using third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed exposition of a statistical method for estimating cosmological parameters from the observation of a large number of strongly lensed binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers observable by next (third) generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. This method, first presented in Jana (2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 261401), compares the observed number of strongly lensed GW events and their time delay distribution (between lensed images) with observed events to infer cosmological parameters. We show that the precision of the estimation of the cosmological parameters does not have a strong dependance on the assumed BBH redshift distribution model. Using the large number of unlensed mergers, XG detectors are expected to measure the BBH redshift distribution with sufficient precision for the cosmological inference. However, a biased inference of the BBH redshift distribution will bias the estimation of cosmological parameters. An incorrect model for the distribution of lens properties can also lead to a biased cosmological inference. However, Bayesian model selection can assist in selecting the right model from a set of available parametric models for the lens distribution. We also present a way to incorporate the effect of contamination in the data due to the limited efficiency of lensing identification methods, so that it will not bias the cosmological inference.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces the Elliptica pseudo-spectral code for generating initial data of binary neutron star systems. Building upon the recent Elliptica code update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise polytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these binary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within the binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the mass shedding limit and can point in any direction.</description>

      <title>Probing new fundamental fields with Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a charged compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole, in modified gravity theories with additional scalar or vector fields. Using the Teukolsky and generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalisms, we provide the post-Newtonian expansion of the energy flux of the vector waves up to $O(v^5)$ beyond the quadrupole formula in the weak field and numerically calculate the energy flux in the strong field for a charged particle moving in circular orbits. Our findings reveal a degeneracy in the scalar and vector charge parameters for weak-field, slow-motion orbits. However, for strong-field, fast-motion orbits close to the innermost stable circular orbit, we observe distinct behaviors between scalar and vector fields. We investigate the potential of using EMRIs detected by space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna to identify whether a black hole carries a scalar or vector charge. The influence of scalar and vector flux on the orbital evolution and tensor GW phase can not help us distinguish scalar and vector fields. However, extra polarizations emitted by the scalar or vector field can break the correlations between the scalar field and vector field and then help us distinguish the scalar and vector field.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing effect of black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the gravitational lensing effects of two quantum-modified black hole models recently proposed in effective quantum gravity. The light deflection angles are calculated for both the weak-field and strong-field limits. Furthermore, using the data for the supermassive black holes SgrA* and M87*, we calculate the lensing observables in the strong-field limit. We find that the quantum parameter plays a role analogous to the electric charge in weak gravitational lensing. In the strong-field limit, in contrast, the effects of the quantum parameter on the deflection angle, the angular separation, and the relative magnification are opposite to those of the electric charge, the scalar charge, and the quantum parameters in some gravity theories. The results indicate the crucial difference between the classical black holes and the two quantum-modified black hole models that depend on the quantum correction, making them a valuable tool for distinguishing these black hole models.</description>

      <title>Which gravitational lensing degeneracies are broken in wave-optics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies gravitational lensing degeneracies in the wave-optics regime, focusing on lensed gravitational waves (GWs). Considering lensing degeneracies as re-scaling (or transformations) of arrival time delay surface, we can divide them into local and global types. Local degeneracies only affect the time delay surface in localized regions, whereas global degeneracies re-scale the whole time delay surface by a constant while keeping the various observed image properties unchanged. We show that local degeneracies can be broken in the wave-optics regime since lensing effects become sensitive to the overall arrival time delay surface and not only to the time delay values at the image positions. On the other hand, global degeneracies (such as similarity transformation, prismatic transformation, and mass-sheet degeneracy) multiply the amplification factor by a constant factor (let us say, $\lambda$). However, in GW lensing, as the GW signal amplitude depends on the source distance, it turns out that $\lambda$ is completely degenerate with the Hubble constant, similar to what we see in geometric optics. Hence, with the lensing of GWs, global degeneracies are as hard to break in wave optics as they are in geometric optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves since GW150914 has gained renewed interest in a quantum-classical correspondence between GWs and the hypothetical graviton. While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, massless gravitons in a 3+1 spacetime are often modeled as the quantum noise underlying GWs and between two gravitational masses. This study treats a coalescing binary heuristically as a rotating and contracting Gaussian volume, modeling the gravitons composing the gravitational bulk as an effectively thermal gas. Applying the Einstein-Langevin equation to the coalescing binary system, a relation is established where quanta dissipation scales directly with the third power of osculating eccentricity and inversely with the contracting volume. Numerical analysis employs an Euler iteration scheme to simulate gravitonic Brownian motion throughout binary coalescence. The resulting noise signals exhibit characteristics resembling macroscopic gravitational waveforms. Reproducible coding implementations in Wolfram Mathematica are provided, with equivalent Python commands included in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of power-law cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the stability of power-law models, focusing on an alternative approach that differs significantly from the standard approaches used in studying power-law models. In the standard approach, stability is studied by reducing the system of background FRW equations to a one-dimensional system for a new background variable $X$ in terms of the number of e-foldings. However, we rewrote the equations, incorporating $H$ into the system and went on to do the calculations up to the second order. We demonstrate by computing the deviations from the power-law exact solution to second-order in time and show that power-law contraction is never an attractor in time, regardless of parameter values. Our analysis shows that while first-order corrections align with existing interpretations, second-order corrections introduce significant deviations that cannot be explained by a simple time shift that explains the first-order diverging terms. With importance, we note that in the number of e-folds, the system remains an attractor, while in cosmic time, it is unstable. We also support our claim with numerical results. This new insight has broader implications for the study of attractor behaviour of differential equation solutions and raises questions about the stability of scenarios like the ekpyrotic bounce driven by an exponential potential. Our work also hints that the different temporal variables we use might not be equivalent.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in non-metricity gravity through Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

Abstract: The spacetime of colliding electromagnetic (em) waves transforms into near horizon geometry (NHG) of an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (BH), suggesting that upon collision pure light beams can produce BHs that can be identified indirectly. Due to the quantum restrictions such BHs can have horizon radii in the range $R&gt;10^{8}m$. These electromagnetic BHs are accompanied by impulsive gravitational waves to be instrumental in their detection. If such BHs do exist this may open a new frontier in our understanding of BHs. In poetic words: Let there be light, to collide and create holes that are not white!</description>

      <title>$\tilde\xi$-attractors in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>The Critical Role of LIGO-India in the Era of Next-Generation Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy, driven by gravitational-wave observations, is a rapidly evolving field poised for significant advancements over the next decade. This paper examines the role of the upcoming LIGO-India detector in enhancing multi-messenger efforts by comparing ten networks using key metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sky localization area ($\Delta \Omega_{90}$), and the precision of astrophysical parameter measurements. Our results show that a network with two L-shaped Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors and one triangular Einstein Telescope (ET) performs best, detecting nearly the entire annual binary neutron star merger population ($\sim$ 16000 events) up to redshift of 0.5 with SNR $\geq 10$, and localizing over 10000 events within 10 deg$^2$, including 146 events within 0.1 deg$^2$. It detects over 9000 events with relative luminosity distance errors $\Delta D_L / D_L &lt; 0.1$, including 110 with sub-percent errors. Notably, replacing the 20 km CE detector with LIGO-India retains comparable performance, localizing over 9000 events within 10 deg$^2$ and 86 within 0.1 deg$^2$. This network detects over 5700 events with $\Delta D_L / D_L &lt; 0.1$, including 55 events with sub-percent $D_L$ errors. Both networks localize $\mathcal{O}(100)$ mergers within 10 deg$^2$ up to 10 minutes pre-merger, significantly outperforming a network of two CE detectors and LIGO-Livingston. While I$^\sharp$ achieves localization and early warning performance comparable to the 20 km CE detector within the evaluated metrics, its shorter arms and narrower sensitivity band may limit its effectiveness for other science goals. These differences suggest that, although CE20's contributions may extend beyond this paper's scope, our findings underscore LIGO-India's strong potential for precise source localization and extended early warning times--critical advancements for multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Numerical results on Quantum Energy Inequalities in Integrable Models at the Two-Particle level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the impact of self-interaction and multiparticle states on sustaining negative energies in relativistic quantum systems. For physically reasonable models, one usually requires bounds on both magnitude and duration of the accumulation of negative energy, typically given in form of a quantum energy inequality (QEI). Such bounds have applications in semiclassical gravity where they exclude exotic spacetime geometries and imply the formation of singularities. The essence of this article is a novel numerical method for determining optimal QEI bounds at the one- or two-particle level, extending previous work focused on the one-particle case and overcoming a new type of technical challenge associated with the two-particle scenario. Our method is tailored for integrable models in quantum field theory constructed via the S-matrix boostrap. Applying the method to a representative model, the sinh-Gordon model, we confirm self-interaction as the source of negative energy, with stronger interactions leading to more pronounced negativities. Moreover, we establish the validity of QEIs and the averaged weak energy condition (AWEC) at the one- and two-particle level. Lastly, we identify a constrained one-parameter class of nonminimal stress tensor expressions satisfying QEIs at both levels, with more stringent constraints emerging from the QEI bounds at the two-particle level.</description>

      <title>Were you born in an aborted primordial black hole?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the Standard Model and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and Dark Matter (DM) densities. Large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally, leading to regions with a maximal baryogenesis at the Quantum Chromodynamics epoch. Using numerical relativity simulations, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis. If PBH significantly contribute to the DM, aborted PBHs can generate a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>The interacting double white dwarf population with LISA; stochastic foreground and resolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA. Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems. We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty, and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.</description>

      <title>The Classical Limit of Teleparallel Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider the classical (i.e., non-relativistic) limit of Teleparallel Gravity, a relativistic theory of gravity that is empirically equivalent to General Relativity and features torsional forces. I show that as the speed of light is allowed to become infinite, Teleparallel Gravity reduces to Newtonian Gravity without torsion. I compare these results to the torsion-free context and discuss their implications on the purported underdetermination between Teleparallel Gravity and General Relativity. I conclude by considering alternative approaches to the classical limit developed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>From $SU(2)$ holonomies to holographic duality via tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Double Copy in AdS3 from Minitwistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double copy relates gravitational theories to the square of gauge theories. While it is well understood in flat backgrounds, its precise realisation around curved spacetimes remains an open question. In this paper, we construct a classical double copy for cohomology class representatives in the minitwistor space of hyperbolic spacetimes. We find that the realisation of a physical double copy requires that the masses of the different spinning fields are not equal, contrary to the flat space prescription. This leads to a position-space double copy for bulk-to-boundary propagators. We also show that in coordinate space, this implies the Cotton double copy for waves and warped black holes of Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that these are exact double copy relations by constructing their Kerr-Schild metrics and also analysing the Kerr-Schild double copy. Furthermore, we find that near the boundary the double copy relates the dual CFT currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous symmetries of spacetime such as spatial homogeneity and isotropy are rigorously defined using the concept of isometries and Killing vectors. In supergravity, the metric, or rather the tetrad, is not a standalone entity, but is part of a multiplet containing also the Rarita-Schwinger spinor-vector. Thus, we pursue a generalization of the Killing equations that is in harmony with the tenets of supergravity. Using a superfield approach, we derive one such generalization of the Killing equations encompassing the whole supergravity multiplet. A relaxation of the spinor-vector equations is required to allow for a non-vanishing isotropic Rarita-Schwinger field.</description>

      <title>Running gravitational constant induced dark energy as a solution to $\sigma_8$ tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a modified gravity model with a running gravitational constant coupled to a varying dark energy fluid and test its imprint on the growth of structure in the universe. Using Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurement results, we show a tension at the $3 \sigma$ level between the best fit $\Lambda$CDM and the corresponding parameters obtained from the Planck data. Unlike many modified gravity-based solutions that overlook scale dependence and model-specific background evolution, we study this problem in the broadest possible context by incorporating both factors into our investigation. We performed a full perturbation analysis to demonstrate a scale dependence in the growth equation. Fixing the scale to $k = 0.1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and introducing a phenomenological functional form for the varying Newton coupling $G$ with only one free parameter, we conduct a likelihood analysis of the RSD selected data. The analysis reveals that the model can bring the tension level within $1 \sigma$ while maintaining the deviation of $G$ from Newton's gravitational constant at the fifth order.</description>

      <title>Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity with 3d Velocity Reconstruction from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic velocity field is an unbiased probe of the total matter distribution but is challenging to measure directly at intermediate and high redshifts. The large-scale velocity field imprints a signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. We perform the first 3d reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field from the kSZ effect by applying a quadratic estimator to CMB temperature maps and the 3d positions of galaxies. We do so by combining CMB data from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (in combination with Planck) and a spectroscopic galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We then measure the galaxy-velocity cross-power spectrum and detect the presence of the kSZ signal at a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.2$\sigma$. Using this galaxy-velocity cross-correlation alone, we constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity finding $f_{\rm NL}=-90^{+210}_{-350}$. This pathfinder measurement sets the stage for joint galaxy-CMB kSZ constraints to significantly enhance the $f_{\rm NL}$ information obtained from galaxy surveys through sample variance cancellation.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>
