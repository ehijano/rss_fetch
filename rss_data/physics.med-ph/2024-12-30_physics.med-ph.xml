      <title>Optical detection of the spatial structural alteration in the human brain tissues and cells and DNA and chromatin due to Parkinsons disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinsons disease (PD) is considered one of the most frequent neurological diseases in the world. There is a need to study the early and efficient biomarkers of Parkinsons, such as changes in structural disorders like DNA and chromatin, especially at the subcellular level in the human brain. We used two techniques, Partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect the changes in structural disorder in the human brain tissue samples. It was observed from the PWS experiment that there was an increase in structural disorder in Parkinsons disease tissues and cells when compared to normal tissues and cells using mesoscopic light transport theory. Furthermore, the IPR experiment also showed DNA and chromatin structural alterations that have the same trend and support the PWS results. The increase in mass density in the nuclei components, such as DNA and chromatin, can be linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of the brain. This protein deposition is considered a significant cause of neuronal death in the brains of PD patients. We also did a histological analysis of brain tissues, which supports our results from dual photonics techniques. The results show that this dual technique is a powerful approach to detect the changes. Our results highlight the potential of the parameter, related to the structural disorder strength, as an efficient biomarker for PD progress, paving the way for research into early disease detection.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Optimized Basis Functions for Self-Navigated Motion Correction in Quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The long scan times of quantitative MRI techniques make motion artifacts more likely. For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can be addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on reconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the SVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast between tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The purpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between two types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates.
  Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain parenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean autocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain orthogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying motion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging.
  Results: A comparative analysis shows that the contrast-optimized basis significantly improve the parenchyma-CSF contrast, leading to smoother motion estimates and reduced artifacts in the quantitative maps.
  Conclusion: The proposed contrast-optimized subspace improves the accuracy of the motion estimation.</description>

      <title>High performance Black Phosphorus/Graphitic Carbon Nitride Heterostructure-based Wearable Sensor for Real-time Sweat Glucose Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable, non-invasive glucose sensors capable of accurate and continuous monitoring are crucial for managing metabolic conditions yet achieving high sensitivity and stability in these devices remains challenging. In this work, we present a Black Phosphorus/Graphitic Carbon Nitride (BP/g-CN) heterostructure engineered to leverage phosphorus-nitrogen interactions for enhanced electrochemical glucose oxidation activity. Compared to pristine gCN, the BP-gCN heterostructure demonstrates a significantly improved electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and nearly two-fold reduction in charge transfer resistance (Rct), achieving remarkable glucose sensitivity of 1.1 uA mM(^-1) cm(^-2) at physiological pH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed stronger glucose adsorption and higher charge transfer on the BP-gCN heterostructure compared to pristine gCN surface. These theoretical insights complement the experimental findings, highlighting the superior electrocatalytic performance of the heterostructure and the role of oxidized BP surface. Furthermore, the BP-gCN sensor is integrated into a wearable device platform with microfluidic layers and a Near Field Communication (NFC) chip, forming a conformal skin patch that enables real-time sweat glucose monitoring. This demonstration of a high-performance, non-enzymatic wearable glucose sensor based on a heterostructure design underscores the potential of the device for seamless health management and paves the way for next generation biosensing platforms aimed at improving personalized and continuous health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for improving radiomic-based models in radiation pneumonitis prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a side effect of thoracic radiation therapy. Recently, Machine learning (ML) models enhanced with radiomic and dosiomic features provide better predictions by incorporating spatial information beyond DVHs. However, to improve the clinical decision process, we propose to use uncertainty quantification (UQ) to improve the confidence in model prediction. This study evaluates the impact of post hoc UQ methods on the discriminative performance and calibration of ML models for RP prediction. Methods: This study evaluated four ML models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and random forest (RF), using radiomic, dosiomic, and dosimetric features to predict RP. We applied UQ methods, including Patt scaling, isotonic regression, Venn-ABERS predictor, and Conformal Prediction, to quantify uncertainty. Model performance was assessed through Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV). Results: UQ methods enhanced predictive performance, particularly for high-certainty predictions, while also improving calibration. Radiomic and dosiomic features increased model accuracy but introduced calibration challenges, especially for non-linear models like XGB and RF. Performance gains from UQ methods were most noticeable at higher certainty thresholds. Conclusion: Integrating UQ into ML models with radiomic and dosiomic features improves both predictive accuracy and calibration, supporting more reliable clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the value of UQ methods in enhancing applicability of predictive models for RP in healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of fractal and multifractal connection to structural disorder in weakly optical disordered media: Application to cancer detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light scattering experiment establishes a relationship between refractive index fluctuations and fractal dimension in weakly scattering tissue-like media. Based on the box-counting approach, an analytical model is developed and shows that the fractal dimension has a functional dependency on the structural disorder or refractive index fluctuation for short-range correlation and approximately linearly depends on each other for tissue-like media. Several parametric imaging systems can be connected using this approach. Further, tissue's weak multifractality optical scattering is explored using the box-counting method. It is shown that with a functional transformation, the distribution follows lognormal distributions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Quantitative Cerebral Perfusion Images Directly From Measured Sinogram Data Acquired Using C-arm Cone-Beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To shorten the door-to-puncture time for better treating patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is highly desired to obtain quantitative cerebral perfusion images using C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) equipped in the interventional suite. However, limited by the slow gantry rotation speed, the temporal resolution and temporal sampling density of typical C-arm CBCT are much poorer than those of multi-detector-row CT in the diagnostic imaging suite. The current quantitative perfusion imaging includes two cascaded steps: time-resolved image reconstruction and perfusion parametric estimation. For time-resolved image reconstruction, the technical challenge imposed by poor temporal resolution and poor sampling density causes inaccurate quantification of the temporal variation of cerebral artery and tissue attenuation values. For perfusion parametric estimation, it remains a technical challenge to appropriately design the handcrafted regularization for better solving the associated deconvolution problem. These two challenges together prevent obtaining quantitatively accurate perfusion images using C-arm CBCT. The purpose of this work is to simultaneously address these two challenges by combining the two cascaded steps into a single joint optimization problem and reconstructing quantitative perfusion images directly from the measured sinogram data. In the developed direct cerebral perfusion parametric image reconstruction technique, TRAINER in short, the quantitative perfusion images have been represented as a subject-specific conditional generative model trained under the constraint of the time-resolved CT forward model, perfusion convolutional model, and the subject's own measured sinogram data. Results shown in this paper demonstrated that using TRAINER, quantitative cerebral perfusion images can be accurately obtained using C-arm CBCT in the interventional suite.</description>
