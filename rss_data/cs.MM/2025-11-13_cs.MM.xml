      <title>Spatio-Temporal Data Enhanced Vision-Language Model for Traffic Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.</description>

      <title>MCAD: Multimodal Context-Aware Audio Description Generation For Soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Category-level Articulated Object Pose Tracking on SE(3) Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.</description>

      <title>Mina: A Multilingual LLM-Powered Legal Assistant Agent for Bangladesh for Empowering Access to Justice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

      <title>Robust Multi-modal Task-oriented Communications with Redundancy-aware Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications for multi-modal data can transmit task-relevant information efficiently over noisy and bandwidth-limited channels. However, a key challenge is to simultaneously compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion. To address the challenge, we propose a robust and efficient multi-modal task-oriented communication framework that integrates a two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information (MI) redundancy minimization. In the first stage, we apply uni-modal VIB to compress each modality separately, i.e., text, audio, and video, while preserving task-specific features. To enhance efficiency, an MI minimization module with adversarial training is then used to suppress cross-modal dependencies and to promote complementarity rather than redundancy. In the second stage, a multi-modal VIB is further used to compress the fused representation and to enhance robustness against channel distortion. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Our work provides a principled framework that jointly optimizes modality-specific compression, inter-modal redundancy, and communication reliability.</description>

      <title>ROI-based Deep Image Compression with Implicit Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Clarifier: A Zero-Shot Multimodal Framework for Egocentric Intent Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of egocentric AI agents is fundamentally limited by multimodal intent ambiguity. This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction.</description>

      <title>SciCom Wiki: A Digital Library to Support the Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure for Videos and Podcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Videos and Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI), which curates these increasingly non-textual media, remains fragmented and inadequately equipped to scale against the content flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) media representation, particularly for videos and podcasts. We survey requirements from 53 stakeholders and individually refine these insights in 11 interviews. We then design and implement an open-source service system centered on Wikibase and evaluate our prototype with another 14 participants. Overall, our findings identified several needs to support the SciCom KI systematically. Our SciCom Wiki approach was found suitable to address the raised requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge node similar to Wikidata, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale the necessary features against the imminent (mis-)information flood.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Carrier Allocation: A Cross-Modal Reasoning Framework for Adaptive Multimodal Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital world, which has many different types of media, steganography, the art of secret communication, has a lot of problems to deal with. Traditional methods are often fixed and only work with one type of carrier media. This means they don't work well with all the different types of media that are out there. This system doesn't send data to "weak" or easily detectable carriers because it can't adapt. This makes the system less safe and less secret in general. This paper proposes a novel Intelligent Carrier Allocation framework founded on a Cross-Modal Reasoning (CMR) Engine. This engine looks at a wide range of carriers, such as images, audio, and text, to see if they are good for steganography. It uses important measurements like entropy, signal complexity, and vocabulary richness to come up with a single reliability score for each modality. The framework uses these scores to fairly and intelligently share the secret bitstream, giving more data to carriers that are thought to be stronger and more complex. This adaptive allocation strategy makes the system as hard to find as possible and as strong as possible against steganalysis. We demonstrate that this reasoning-based approach is more secure and superior in data protection compared to static, non-adaptive multimodal techniques. This makes it possible to build stronger and smarter secret communication systems.</description>

      <title>RFNNS: Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography with Universal Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative AI, image steganography has garnered widespread attention due to its unique concealment. Recent studies have demonstrated the practical advantages of Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS), notably its ability to achieve stable information embedding and extraction without any additional network training. However, the stego images generated by FNNS still exhibit noticeable distortion and limited robustness. These drawbacks compromise the security of the embedded information and restrict the practical applicability of the method. To address these limitations, we propose Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography (RFNNS). Specifically, a texture-aware localization technique selectively embeds perturbations carrying secret information into regions of complex textures, effectively preserving visual quality. Additionally, a robust steganographic perturbation generation (RSPG) strategy is designed to enhance the decoding accuracy, even under common and unknown attacks. These robust perturbations are combined with AI-generated cover images to produce stego images. Experimental results demonstrate that RFNNS significantly improves robustness compared to state-of-the-art FNNS methods, achieving an average increase in SSIM of 23\% for recovered secret images under common attacks. Furthermore, the LPIPS value of recovered secrets images against previously unknown attacks achieved by RFNNS was reduced to 39\% of the SOTA method, underscoring its practical value for covert communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating virtual activities, leveraging the integration of vision-language modalities to enable the interpretation of virtual environments. Our approach recognizes and abstracts key scene elements including scene layouts, semantic contexts, and object identities with MLLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities. By correlating these abstractions with massive knowledge about human activities, MLLMs are capable of generating adaptive and contextually relevant virtual activities. We propose a structured framework to articulate abstract activity descriptions, emphasizing detailed multi-character interactions within virtual spaces. Utilizing the derived high-level contexts, our approach accurately positions virtual characters and ensures that their interactions and behaviors are realistically and contextually appropriate through strategic optimization. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, providing a novel direction for enhancing the realism and context-awareness in simulated virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Prompt-OT: An Optimal Transport Regularization Paradigm for Knowledge Preservation in Vision-Language Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

      <title>SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-Guided and Personalized Music Editing</title>

Abstract: Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided editing methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes. However, these methods often struggle to preserve the musical content. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that improve the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality.</description>
