      <title>Factoring through monomial representations: arithmetic characterizations and ambiguity of weighted automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize group representations that factor through monomial representations, respectively, block-triangular representations with monomial diagonal blocks, by arithmetic properties. Similar results are obtained for semigroup representations by invertible transformations. The characterizations use results on unit equations from Diophantine number theory (by Evertse, van der Poorten, and Schlickewei in characteristic zero, and by Derksen and Masser in positive characteristic).
  Specialized to finitely generated groups in characteristic zero, one of our main theorems recovers a slight improvement of a very recent similar characterization by Corvaja, Demeio, Rapinchuk, Ren, and Zannier that was motivated by the study of the bounded generation (BG) property. In positive characteristic, we get a characterization of linear BG groups, recovering a theorem of Ab\'ert, Lubotzky, and Pyber from 2003.
  Our motivation comes from weighted finite automata (WFA) over a field. For invertible WFA we show that $M$-ambiguity, finite ambiguity, and polynomial ambiguity are characterized by arithmetic properties. We discover a full correspondence between arithmetic properties and a complexity hierarchy for WFA based on ambiguity. In the invertible case, this is a far-reaching generalization of a recent result by Bell and the second author, characterizing unambiguous WFA, that resolved a 1979 conjecture of Reutenauer. As a consequence, using the computability of the (linear) Zariski closure of a finitely generated matrix semigroup, the $M$-ambiguity, finite ambiguity, and polynomial ambiguity properties are algorithmically decidable for invertible WFA.</description>

      <title>Conditional Non-Soficity of p-adic Deligne Extensions: on a Theorem of Gohla and Thom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem asks whether every group is sofic, i.e., can be separated by almost-homomorphisms to the symmetric group $Sym(n)$. Similar problems have been asked with respect to almost-homomorphisms to the unitary group $U(n)$, equipped with various norms. One of these problems has been solved for the first time in [De Chiffre, Gelbsky, Lubotzky, Thom, 2020]: some central extensions $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$ of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ were shown to be non-Frobenius approximated by almost homomorphisms to $U(n)$. Right after, it was shown that similar results hold with respect to the $p$-Schatten norms in [Lubotzky, Oppenheim, 2020]. It is natural, and has already been suggested in [Chapman, Lubotzky, 2024] and [Gohla, Thom, 2024], to check whether the $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ are also non-sofic. In order to show that they are (also) non-sofic, it suffices:
  (a) To prove that the permutation Cheeger constant of the simplicial complex underlying $\Gamma$ is positive, generalizing [Evra, Kaufman, 2016]. This would imply that $\Gamma$ is stable.
  (b) To prove that the (flexible) stability of $\Gamma$ implies the non-soficity of $\widetilde{\Gamma}$.
  Clause (b) was proved by Gohla and Thom. Here we offer a more algebraic/combinatorial treatment to their theorem.</description>

      <title>Geometric Combinatorics of Polynomials II: Polynomials and Cell Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed rectangular region. We call this the branched rectangle complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed rectangle. The vertices of the cell structure are indexed by the combinatorial "basketballs" studied by Martin, Savitt and Singer. Structurally, the branched rectangle complex is a full subcomplex of a direct product of two copies of the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice. Topologically, it is homeomorphic to the closed $2n$-dimensional ball where $n=d-1$. Metrically, the simplices in each factor are orthoschemes. It can also be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$.
  We also introduce a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed annular region. We call this the branched annulus complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed annulus.It can be constructed from the branched rectangle complex as a cellular quotient by isometric face identifications. And it can be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ with distinct roots.
  Finally, the branched annulus complex deformation retracts to the branched circle complex, which we identify with the dual braid complex. Our explicit embedding of the dual braid complex as a spine for the space of polynomials with distinct roots provides a direct proof that these two classifying spaces for the braid group are homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <title>Composition Multiplicities of Tensor Products and Branching Multiplicities for $\text{GL}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following work of Brundan and Kleshchev (2000), which considered tensor products with the natural module (and its dual) for $\text{GL}(n)$, we take the next fundamental module and explore the relationship between multiplicities of composition factors of tensor products of simple modules for $\text{GL}(n)$ and branching multiplicities. In doing this we provide a method for determining the composition multiplicities for some composition factors of tensor products of simple modules with the wedge square of the dual natural module.</description>

      <title>Inner and Outer Derivations of $\mathbb{F}V_{8n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field of characteristic $0$ or an odd rational prime $p$. In this article, we give an explicit classification of all the inner and outer derivations of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}V_{8n}$, where $V_{8n}$ is a group of order $8n$ ($n$ a positive integer) with presentation $\langle a, b \mid a^{2n} = b^{4} = 1, ba = a^{-1}b^{-1}, b^{-1}a = a^{-1}b \rangle$. First, we explicitly classify all the $\mathbb{F}$-derivations of $\mathbb{F}V_{8n}$ by giving the dimension and a basis of the derivation algebra consisting of all $\mathbb{F}$-derivations of $\mathbb{F}V_{8n}$. Consequently, we classify all inner and outer derivations of $\mathbb{F}V_{8n}$ when $\mathbb{F}$ is an algebraic extension of a prime field. Thus, we establish that all the derivations of $\mathbb{F}V_{8n}$ are inner when the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$ is $0$ or $p$ with $p$ relatively prime to $n$, and that non-zero outer derivations exist only in the case when the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$ is $p$ with $p$ dividing $n$.</description>

      <title>Heights of one- and two-sided congruence lattices of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The height of a poset $P$ is the supremum of the cardinalities of chains in $P$. The exact formula for the height of the subgroup lattice of the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_n$ is known, as is an accurate asymptotic formula for the height of the subsemigroup lattice of the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$. Motivated by the related question of determining the heights of the lattices of left- and right congruences of $\mathcal{T}_n$, we develop a general method for computing the heights of lattices of both one- and two-sided congruences for semigroups. We apply this theory to obtain exact height formulae for several monoids of transformations, matrices and partitions, including: the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$, the partial transformation monoid $\mathcal{PT}_n$, the symmetric inverse monoid $\mathcal{I}_n$, the monoid of order-preserving transformations $\mathcal{O}_n$, the full matrix monoid $\mathcal{M}(n,q)$, the partition monoid $\mathcal{P}_n$, the Brauer monoid $\mathcal{B}_n$ and the Temperley-Lieb monoid $\mathcal{TL}_n$.</description>

      <title>Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$ and the Cowling--Haagerup constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$ is an obstruction to weak amenability with Cowling--Haagerup constant $1$. More precisely, if $G$ is a countable group and $H$ is an infinite subgroup of $G$ such that the pair $(G,H)$ has relative Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$, then the weak Haagerup constant $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\mathrm{WH}}(G)$ is strictly greater than $1$. We apply this result to some semidirect products and lattices in higher rank algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>Weakly and Strongly Aperiodic Subshifts of Finite Type on Baumslag-Solitar Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.02534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the periodicity of subshifts of finite type (SFT) on Baumslag-Solitar groups. We show that for residually finite Baumslag-Solitar groups there exist both strongly and weakly-but-not-strongly aperiodic SFTs. In particular, this shows that unlike $\mathbb{Z}^2$, but like $\mathbb{Z}^3$, strong and weak aperiodic SFTs are different classes of SFTs in residually finite BS groups. More precisely, we prove that a weakly aperiodic SFT on BS(m,n) due to Aubrun and Kari is, in fact, strongly aperiodic on BS(1,n); and weakly but not strongly aperiodic on any other BS(m,n). In addition, we exhibit an SFT which is weakly but not strongly aperiodic on BS(1,n); and we show that there exists a strongly aperiodic SFT on BS(n,n).</description>
