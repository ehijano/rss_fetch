      <title>Effect of different Non-Gravitational accelerations on the trajectory of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet C/2025 N1 or 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object. It has passed perihelion on 2025 October 29, and is currently on a path to leave the solar system. During its outbound journey, it will pass close to Jupiter at a distance of 0.358 au. NASA JPL \textsc{Horizons} has updated the non-gravitational parameters of the comet based on the CO$_2$ sublimation model, where $g(r)= 1/r^2$. In this research note, we use the non-gravitational accelerations from \textsc{Horizons} together with symmetric and asymmetric H$_2$O sublimation models derived using \texttt{Find\_Orb} software. We calculate the resulting perijove distances and compare them with our earlier results at epoch JD 2460867.5.</description>

      <title>Evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disc driven by stellar flybys: implications for the streaming instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flybys are a common dynamical process in young stellar clusters and can significantly reshape protoplanetary discs. However, their impact on dust dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in the weakly coupled regime (St$\gg$1). We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of parabolic stellar flybys-both coplanar and inclined-interacting with a gaseous and dusty protoplanetary disc. Dust species with Stokes numbers ranging from 15 to 100, corresponding to four grain sizes under a uniform initial gas surface density, are included. Perturber masses of 0.1 and 1$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ are considered. The induced spiral structures exhibit distinct dynamical behaviours in gas and dust: dust spirals retain a nearly constant pattern speed, while gas spirals gradually decelerate. The pitch angles of both components decrease over time, with dust evolving more rapidly. In the weakly coupled regime, gas and dust spirals are spatially offset, facilitating dust accumulation around both structures. Equal-mass flybys truncate the disc at approximately $\sim$0.55$r_{\mathrm{Hill}}$, producing tightly wound, ring-like spirals that promote dust concentration. By mapping the streaming instability growth rates in the solid abundance-Stokes number space across three evolutionary phases, we find that a low-mass flyby suppresses dust concentration below the critical clumping threshold after periastron and maintains this suppression over time, indicating long-lasting inhibition of dust clumping. An equal-mass flyby raises local solid abundance well above the threshold, suggesting that such encounters may foster conditions favourable for dust clumping. Flyby-induced spirals play a central role in shaping dust evolution, leading to distinct spatial and temporal behaviours in weakly coupled discs.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Gravitational Models: A Tutorial on Spherical Harmonics and the Newtonian Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational interactions is fundamental to the analysis, prediction, and control of space systems. While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation.</description>

      <title>The dependence of the asteroid rotation on their composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational properties of asteroids provide critical information about not only their internal structure but also their collisional and thermal histories. Previous work has revealed a bimodal distribution of asteroid spin rates, dividing populations into fast and slow rotators, but to date this separation remains poorly understood (e.g. its dependency on composition).
  We investigate whether the valley separating fast and slow rotators in rotational period-diameter space depends on the composition of the asteroid, approximated by asteroids' spectral class.
  First, we extended the Minor Planet Physical Properties Catalogue (MP3C) to include the available spectral classes of asteroids. Then, for each asteroid we selected the best diameter, rotational period, and spectral class. Building upon a semi-supervised machine-learning method, we quantify the valley between fast and slow rotators for S- and C-complex asteroids, which are linked to ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites respectively. The method iteratively fits a linear boundary between the two populations in rotational period-diameter space to maximise their separation.
  We find a clear compositional dependence of the valley: for C-complex asteroids the transition occurs at longer periods than for S-complex, with P* = 14.4 D_km^0.739 (C-complex) and P* = 11.6 D_km^0.718 (S-complex), where period and diameter are given in hours and kilometres respectively. This corresponds to mu Q approximately 2 and 13 GPa, respectively, where mu is the rigidity and Q the quality factor.
  The dependence of the valley on spectral classes likely reflects compositional and structural differences: C-complex asteroids, being more porous and weaker, dissipate angular momentum more efficiently than stronger, more coherent S-complex asteroids. This represents quantitative evidence of class-dependent rotational valleys within asteroid populations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Stellar X-ray Photoevaporation on Planetesimal Formation via the Streaming Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of planetesimals via the streaming instability (SI) is a crucial step in planet formation, yet its triggering conditions and efficiency are highly sensitive to both disk properties and specific evolutionary processes. We aim to study the planetesimal formation via the SI, driven by the stellar X-ray photoevaporation during the late stages of disk dispersal, and quantify its dependence on key disk and stellar parameters. We use the DustPy code to simulate the dust dynamics including coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift in a viscously accreting disk undergoing stellar X-ray photoevaporation. Stellar X-rays drive the disk dispersal, opening a cavity at a few au orbital distance and inducing the formation of an associated local pressure maximum. This pressure maximum acts as a trap for radially drifting dust, therefore enhancing the dust density to the critical level required to initiate the streaming instability and the subsequent collapse into planetesimals. The fiducial model produces 31.4 M_\oplus of planetesimals with an initial dust to final planetesimal conversion efficiency of 20.4%. This pathway is most efficient in larger disks with higher metallicities, lower viscosities, higher dust fragmentation threshold velocities, and/or around stars with higher X-ray luminosities. This work demonstrates that stellar X-ray photoevaporation is a robust and feasible mechanism for triggering planetesimal formation via the SI during the final clearing phase of protoplanetary disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Possible favored Great Oxidation Event scenario on exoplanets around M-Stars with the example of TRAPPIST-1e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which marked the transition from an anoxic to an oxygenated atmosphere, occurred 2.4 billion years ago on Earth, several hundreds of millions of years after the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis. This long delay implies that specific conditions in terms of biomass productivity and burial were necessary to trigger the GOE. It could be a limiting factor for the development of oxygenated atmospheres on inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we explore the specificities of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf for a GOE. Using a 1D coupled photochemical-climate model, we simulate the atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-like exoplanet, exploring the effect of oxygen sources (biotic or abiotic). Our results show that the stellar energy distribution promotes O3 production at lower O2 concentrations compared to Earth, and the ozone layer on TRAPPIST-1 e forms more efficiently. This lowers the threshold for atmospheric oxidation, suggesting that the GOE on TRAPPIST-1 e would occur quickly after the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis, up to 1Gyrs earlier than on Earth, and would reach O2 enabling oxygenic respiration and thus the development of animals. We may question whether this is a general behavior around several M-stars. Furthermore, we discuss how the overproduction of ozone could make O3 detection possible using the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a potential method to observe oxygenation signatures on exoplanets in the near future. Previous studies predicted that for an Earth-like atmosphere O3 would require over 150 transits for detection, but our results show that significantly fewer transits could be needed.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Circulation of High-Obliquity Mini-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the operation of JWST, atmospheric characterization has now extended to low-mass exoplanets. In compact multiplanetary systems, secular spin-orbital resonance may preserve high obliquities and asynchronous rotation even for tidally-despinning, low-mass planets, potentially leading to unique atmospheric circulation patterns. To understand the impact on the atmospheric circulation and to identify the potential atmospheric observational signatures of such high-obliquity planets, we simulate the three dimensional circulation of a representative mini-Neptune K2-290 b, whose obliquity may reach about 67 degrees. Whether synchronously rotating or not, the planet's slow rotation, moderate temperature and radius result in a global Weak-Temperature-Gradient (WTG) behavior with moderate horizontal temperature contrasts. Under synchronous rotation, broad eastward superrotating jets efficiently redistribute heat. Circulation in an asynchronous rotation exhibits a seasonal cycle driven by high obliquity, along with quasi-periodic oscillations in winds and temperatures with a period of about 70 orbital periods. These oscillations, driven by wave-mean flow interactions, extend from low to mid-latitudes due to the slow planetary rotation. Higher atmospheric metallicity strengthens radiative forcing, increasing temperature contrasts and jet speeds. Clouds have minimal impact under synchronous rotation but weaken jets under nonsynchronous rotation by reducing temperature contrasts. In all cases, both thermal emission and transmission spectra exhibit moderate observational signals at a level of 100 ppm, and high-obliquity effects contribute differences at the 10 ppm level. Our results are also applicable to a range of potential high-obliquity exoplanets, which reside in the WTG regime and likely exhibit nearly homogeneous horizontal temperature patterns.</description>

      <title>The Role of Intrinsic Temperature and Vertical Mixing in Characterizing Sub-Neptune Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptune planets are often modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich interior beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also be explained by a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. Atmospheric composition provides a key mechanism to break this degeneracy between competing interior models. However, the overall composition of sub-Neptunes inferred from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored parameter spaces such as stellar spectra, atmospheric metallicities, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet poorly constrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint (60 - 450 K) and Kzz (10^{5} - 10^{12} cm^2/s) using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN packages to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that Tint and Kzz significantly impact CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 and HCN abundances, with H2O being largely unaffected. Our work demonstrates that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra, and that single-parameter assumptions can lead to misclassification of planetary interiors. We provide a diagnostic framework using multi-molecule observations to distinguish between competing atmospheric models and advance robust characterization of sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Col-OSSOS: Investigating the Origins of Different Surfaces in the Primordial Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS) measured the optical/NIR colours of a brightness-complete sample of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). Like previous surveys, this one found a bimodal colour distribution in TNOs, categorised as red and very red. Additionally, this survey proposed an alternative surface classification scheme: FaintIR and BrightIR. Cold classical TNOs mostly have very red or FaintIR surfaces, while dynamically excited TNOs show a mixture of surfaces. This likely indicates that formation locations and proximity to the Sun influenced surface characteristics and color changes. Our study combines the data from Col-OSSOS with two dynamical models describing the formation of the Kuiper belt during Neptune's migration. We investigate the proposed surface-colour changing line and explore the distribution of different surfaces within the primordial disk. By comparing radial colour transitions across various scenarios, we explore the origins of surface characteristics and their implications within the context of BrightIR and FaintIR classifications. Moreover, we extend our analysis to examine the distribution of these surface classes within the present-day Kuiper Belt, providing insights into the configuration of the early solar system's planetesimal disk prior to giant planet migration. We find that the most likely primordial disk compositions are inner neutral / outer red (with transition $30.0^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au), or inner BrightIR / outer FaintIR (with transition $31.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au).</description>

      <title>Autonomous Mars Rover Module for Soil Sampling and Life Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a primary focus of scientific exploration, driven by rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe. The discovery of water on Mars has sparked significant interest, raising the question of whether life could exist on the planet. This study proposes a novel approach to simulate and illustrate the detection of life using a proof-of-life module integrated into a Mars rover. The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles. This proof-of-life module serves as a proof-of-concept for autonomous life detection in extraterrestrial environments and lays the foundation for future exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Different Transient Phenomena at the Edges of Traveling Foreshocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations have shown that traveling foreshocks (TFs) are bounded by either foreshock compressional boundaries (FCBs) or foreshock bubbles (FBs). Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.</description>

Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Probing thermal gradients of habitable-zone rocky planets as an anti-indicator of a global surface ocean using mid-infrared direct imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future direct-imaging missions such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) aim to observe thermal emission from potentially habitable planets to characterize their surface environments and search for signs of life. Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using 1D models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature ~280 K) as a benchmark, we compute 3D atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10 bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics, including the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but detecting these features requires longer integration times. These 3D effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on 1D models, and could also lead to misidentification of the H$_2$O band beyond 10 $\mu$m. We also assess the detectability of these 3D effects on other nearby planets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate 3D atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data.</description>

      <title>Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modelled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target W h/day and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields ~0.6-0.8 kW h/day to a 1m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^2$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers ~30-50 kW h/day at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

      <title>Can the jet precession of M87$^\ast$ be caused by a distant intermediate-mass black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application to the case of the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$. In principle, the presence of another distant intermediate-mass black hole may concur to cause the observed jet precession, assumed tightly coupled with the accretion disk. Such a possibility is ruled out by the exclusion plots in the parameter space obtained with the approach presented here.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>
