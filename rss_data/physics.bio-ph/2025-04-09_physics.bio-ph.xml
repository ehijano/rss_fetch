      <title>Hamiltonian Dynamics of Fr\"ohlich Condensates in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late 1960s, Fr\"ohlich proposed that energy in biological systems may not be entirely dissipated, but stored in an orderly manner, as condensates, to support essential cellular functions. Over 50 years later, evidence for collective protein vibrations in the terahertz (THz) domain seems to confirm these ideas. However, Fr\"ohlich's model differs remarkably from molecular dynamics (MD), complicating the interpretation of experimental results. As a first step towards linking Fr\"ohlich's theory with MD-based techniques, Hamiltonian dynamics governing Fr\"ohlich systems are investigated within a classical framework. We show that well-formed condensates can emerge at room temperature from classical Hamiltonians used in normal mode analysis (NMA) to describe protein dynamics. We also suggest a strategy to assess whether standard force fields can capture condensation, paving the way for future studies connecting Fr\"ohlich's model to biomolecular simulations.</description>

      <title>A Solid-State Nanopore Signal Generator for Training Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translocation event detection from raw nanopore current signals is a fundamental step in nanopore signal analysis. Traditional data analysis methods rely on user-defined parameters to extract event information, making the interpretation of experimental results sensitive to parameter choice. While Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across various scientific fields, its potential remains underexplored in solid-state nanopore research.
  In this work, we introduce a nanopore signal generator capable of producing extensive synthetic datasets for machine learning applications and benchmarking nanopore signal analysis platforms. Using this generator, we train deep learning models to detect translocation events directly from raw signals, achieving over 99% true event detection with minimal false positives.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator demonstrates U-ResNet's superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. The model's non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. Statistical analysis of prediction errors reveals that U-ResNet maintains substantially narrower error distributions compared to spectral methods, confirming its reliability for critical hemodynamic assessment. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising tool for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization, with future work focusing on extension to three-dimensional geometries and integration with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Retinotopic Mechanics derived using classical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11632v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a cell$'$s receptive field is a bedrock in systems neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics. At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent. Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions is transiently blunted.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for states that are organized in a fractal and hierarchical manner within the energy landscape. This leads to a not necessarily time homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slow down during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rate, providing analytical solutions that improve our understanding of relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</description>
