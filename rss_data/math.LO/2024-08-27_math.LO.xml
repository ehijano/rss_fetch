      <title>Connecting real and hyperarithmetical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Going back to Kreisel in the Sixties, hyperarithmetical analysis is a cluster of logical systems just beyond arithmetical comprehension. Only recently natural examples of theorems from the mathematical mainstream were identified that fit this category. In this paper, we provide many examples of theorems of real analysis that sit within the range of hyperarithmetical analysis, namely between the higher-order version of $\Sigma_1^1$-AC$_0$ and weak-$\Sigma_1^1$-AC$_0$, working in Kohlenbach's higher-order framework. Our example theorems are based on the Jordan decomposition theorem, unordered sums, metric spaces, and semi-continuous functions. Along the way, we identify a couple of new systems of hyperarithmetical analysis.</description>

      <title>Suszko's Thesis and Many-valued Logical Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we try to formulate a definition of ''many-valued logical structure''. For this, we embark on a deeper study of Suszko's Thesis ($\mathbf{ST}$) and show that the truth or falsity of $\mathbf{ST}$ depends, at least, on the precise notion of semantics. We propose two different notions of semantics and three different notions of entailment. The first one helps us formulate a precise definition of inferentially many-valued logical structures. The second and the third help us to generalise Suszko Reduction and provide adequate bivalent semantics for monotonic and a couple of nonmonotonic logical structures. All these lead us to a closer examination of the played by language/metalanguage hierarchy vis-\'a-vis $\mathbf{ST}$. We conclude that many-valued logical structures can be obtained if the bivalence of all the higher-order metalogics of the logic under consideration is discarded, building formal bridges between the theory of graded consequence and the theory of many-valued logical structures, culminating in generalisations of Suszko's Thesis.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of expansions of Laurent series fields by cyclic discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1987, Pheidas showed that the field of Laurent series $\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ with a constant for the indeterminate $t$ and a predicate for the natural powers $\{t^n \mid n &gt; 0\}$ of $t$ is existentially undecidable. We show that the same result holds true if $t$ is replaced by any element $\alpha$ of positive $t$-adic valuation.</description>

      <title>The weak Ramsey property and extreme amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Kechris--Pestov--Todor\v{c}evi\'c correspondence to weak Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} categories and automorphism groups of generic objects. The new ingredient is the weak Ramsey property. We demonstrate the theory on several examples including monoid categories, the category of almost linear orders, and categories of strong embeddings of trees.</description>

      <title>On the ABK Conjecture, alpha-well Quasi Orders and Dress-Schiffels product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following is a 2008 conjecture of Abraham, Bonnet and Kubi\'s: [ABK Conjecture] Every well quasi order (wqo) is a countable union of better quasi orders (bqo). We obtain a partial progress on the conjecture, by showing that the class of orders that are a countable union of better quasi orders (sigma-bqo) is closed under various operations. These include diverse products, such as the Dress-Shieffels product. We develop various properties of the latter product. In relation with the main question, we explore the class of alpha-wqo for countable ordinals alpha and obtain several closure properties and a Hausdorff-style classification theorem. Our main contribution is the discovery of various properties of sigma-bqos and ruling out potential counterexamples to the ABK Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Th\'eories g\'eom\'etriques pour l'alg\`ebre des nombres r\'eels sans test de signe ni axiome de choix d\'ependant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a dynamical theory as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the field of real numbers in constructive mathematics without axiom of dependent choice. We propose a theory which turns out to be very close to the theory of real closed local rings in classical mathematics. The theory of real closed rings is presented here in constructive form as a natural purely equational theory, which uses virtual root functions introduced in previous work. This work is also a first step through an essential goal for the future, which is to obtain a constructive version of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>On the significance of parameters and the projective level in the Choice and Comprehension axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of generalized iterations of Jensen forcing to define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF for any $n\ge 1$ and each of the following four Choice hypotheses:
  (1) $\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{AC}_\omega(\varPi^1_{n+1})\,;$
  (2) $\text{AC}_\omega(\text{OD})\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land \neg\text{AC}_\omega(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1});$
  (3) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1});$
  (4) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land\neg\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1}).$
  Thus if ZF is consistent and $n\ge1$ then each of these four conjunctions (1)--(4) is consistent with ZF.
  As for the second main result, let PA$^0_2$ be the 2nd-order Peano arithmetic without the Comprehension schema $\text{CA}$. For any $n\ge1$, we define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF, and a set $M\subseteq\mathcal P(\omega)$ in this model, such that $\langle\omega, M\rangle$ satisfies
  (5) PA$^0_2$ + $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty})$ + $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ + $\neg\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$.
  Thus $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ does not imply $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+2})$ in PA$^0_2$ even in the presence of the full parameter-free (countable) Choice $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty}).$</description>

      <title>Geometric theories for real number algebra without sign test or dependent choice axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a constructive theory that is as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the real number field in constructive mathematics without a dependent choice axiom. To this purpose, we use a dynamical version of geometric theories. We obtain a nice description of the algebraic properties of the real number field, but also a first outline for a constructive theory of certain o-minimal structures. The memoir we present here is an unfinished development of the article by the authors https://inria.hal.science/hal-01426164. Compared to that paper, however, we have modified the definition of continuous semialgebraic functions, in the same spirit in which Bishop defines a continuous real function as a uniformly continuous function on any bounded interval. Despite its unfinished nature and the many questions that we do not currently know how to answer, we hope that this paper will arouse interest for its original approach to the subject. This paper is an English translation of a French version on arXiv:2406.15218</description>

      <title>Regular bi-interpretability and finite axiomatizability of Chevalley groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Chevalley groups over commutative rings with~$1$, constructed by irreducible root systems of rank $&gt;1$. We always suppose that for the systems $A_2, B_\ell, C_\ell, F_4, G_2$ our rings contain $1/2$ and for the system $G_2$ also $1/3$. Under these assumptions we prove that the central quotients of Chevalley groups are regularly bi-interpretable with the corresponding rings, the class of all central quotients of Chevalley groups of a given type is elementarily definable and even finitely axiomatizable (see Definition~2.2). The same holds for adjoint Chevalley groups and for bondedly generated Chevalley groups. We also give an example of Chevalley group with infinite center, which is not bi-interpretable with the corresponding ring and is elementarily equivalent to a group that is not a Chevalley group itself.</description>

Abstract: Weyl's interpretation of quantified formulas should not be conflated with Hilbert's. His semantic reasons for rejecting the law of excluded middle are based on a normative conception of transfinite mathematics as a system of conditional obligations.</description>
