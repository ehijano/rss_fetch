      <title>Coherent coupling of circular Rydberg qubits to inner shell excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divalent atoms provide excellent means for advancing control in Rydberg atom-based quantum simulation and computing, due to the second optically active valence electron available. Particularly promising in this context are circular Rydberg atoms, for which long-lived ionic core excitations can be exploited without suffering from detrimental autoionization. Here, we report measurements of the electric quadrupole coupling between the metastable 4D$_{3/2}$ level and a very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular Rydberg qubit, realized in doubly excited $^{88}$Sr atoms. We measure the kHz-scale differential level shift on the circular Rydberg qubit via beat-node Ramsey interferometry comprising spin echo. Observing this coupling requires coherent interrogation of the Rydberg states for more than one hundred microseconds, which is assisted by tweezer trapping and circular state lifetime enhancement in a black-body radiation suppressing capacitor. Our results demonstrate access to weak electron-electron interactions in Rydberg atoms and expand the quantum simulation toolbox for optical control of highly excited circular state qubits via ionic core manipulation.</description>

      <title>Ratchet Loading and Multi-Ensemble Operation in an Optical Lattice Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate programmable control over the spatial distribution of ultra-cold atoms confined in an optical lattice. The control is facilitated through a combination of spatial manipulation of the magneto-optical trap and atomic population shelving to a metastable state. We first employ the technique to load an extended (5 mm) atomic sample with uniform density in an optical lattice clock, reducing atomic interactions and realizing remarkable frequency homogeneity across the atomic cloud. We also prepare multiple spatially separated atomic ensembles and realize multi-ensemble clock operation within the standard one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice clock architecture. Leveraging this technique, we prepare two oppositely spin-polarized ensembles that are independently addressable, offering a platform for implementing spectroscopic protocols for enhanced tracking of local oscillator phase. Finally, we demonstrate a relative fractional frequency instability at one second of $2.4(1) \times10^{-17}$ between two ensembles, useful for characterization of intra-lattice differential systematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculations for the first and second ionization potentials of lawrencium and lutetium and the electron affinity of lawrencium are performed with Dirac-Coulomb-Breit relativistic coupled cluster method. The contributions of extrapolation of complete basis set limit for uncontracted Dyall basis set and higher order corrections are added to the coupled-cluster results. The agreement between our predictions of Lu IP$_{2}$ and Lr IP$_{1}$ with experimental values verifies the high accuracy prediction of IP$_{2}$ and EA of Lr.</description>

      <title>Realization of a cold atom gyroscope in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision gyroscopes in space are important for sophisticated scientific experiments and deep space navigation. Microgravity in the space provides an ideal condition for operation of a cold atom gyroscope. To demonstrate this advantage, an atom interferometer (AI) was launched and installed in the China Space Station in 2022. Here reported is a realization of the cold atom gyroscope with this AI. By applying point source interferometry, spatial fringes are obtained and acceleration and rotation are extracted. The angles of the Raman lasers are precisely calibrated to avoid measurement error, and other systematic errors are also considered for the rotation measurement. The evaluated rotation measurement is (-115.64+/-1.71)*10^-5 rad/s in space, and an acceleration measurement resolution of 1.03*10^-6 m/s^2 is also obtained for a single image. This study conducts the first AI-based gyroscope in space and paves a way for future space-based AI experiments.</description>

      <title>Metastable doubly-charged Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$_3^{2+}$ is a one-electron system with three positive nuclei and is known to be unstable in its electronic ground-state. We examine an analogous one-electron system composed of a $^{87}$Rb Rydberg atom interacting with a pair of cations and predict the existence of metastable vibrationally-bound states of $^{87}$Rb$_3^{2+}$. These molecules are long-range trimers whose stability rests on the presence of core-shell electrons and favourable scaling of the Rydberg atom's quadrupole moment with the principal quantum number $n$. Unlike recently observed ion-Rydberg dimers, whose binding is due to internal flipping of the Rydberg atom's dipole moment, the binding of $^{87}$Rb$_3^{2+}$ arises from the interaction of the ions with the Rydberg atom's quadrupole moment. The stability of these trimers is highly sensitive to $n$. We do not expect these states to exist below $n=24$ and for $n \leq 35$, their lifetime is limited by tunnelling of the Rydberg electron. In contrast, at very large $n$ the lifetime will be limited by tunnelling of the vibrational wavepacket. In between these limits, we expect a range of bound states at intermediate $n$ for which both tunnelling rates are smaller than the radiative decay rate of the Rydberg state.</description>

      <title>Unraveling hydrodynamization using ultracold 1D gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Continuous momentum state lasing and cavity frequency-pinning with laser-cooled strontium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-cooled gases of atoms interacting with the field of an optical cavity are a powerful tool for quantum sensing and the simulation of open and closed quantum systems. They can display spontaneous self-organisation phase transitions, time crystals, new lasing mechanisms, squeezed states for quantum sensing, protection of quantum coherence, and dynamical phase transitions. However, all of these phenomena are explored in a discontinuous manner due to the need to stop and reload a new ensemble of atoms. Here we report the observation of hours-long continuous lasing from laser-cooled $^{88}$Sr atoms continuously loaded into a ring cavity. The required inversion to produce lasing arises from inversion in the atomic momentum degree of freedom, a mechanism related directly to self-organization phase transitions and collective atomic recoil lasing, both of which were previously only observed in a cyclic fashion compared to the truly continuous behavior here. Further, the sensitivity of the lasing frequency to cavity frequency changes is 120 fold suppressed due to an atomic loss mechanism, opening an interesting new path to compensate cavity frequency noise for realizing narrow frequency references. This work opens the way for continuous cavity QED quantum simulation experiments as well as continuous superradiant lasers.</description>

      <title>Quantum quench dynamics as a shortcut to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently prepare ground states of quantum Hamiltonians via adiabatic protocols is typically limited by the smallest energy gap encountered during the quantum evolution. This presents a key obstacle for quantum simulation and realizations of adiabatic quantum algorithms in large systems, particularly when the adiabatic gap vanishes exponentially with system size. Using QuEra's Aquila programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we experimentally demonstrate a method to circumvent such limitations. Specifically, we develop and test a "sweep-quench-sweep" quantum algorithm in which the incorporation of a quench step serves as a remedy to the diverging adiabatic timescale. These quenches introduce a macroscopic reconfiguration between states separated by an extensively large Hamming distance, akin to quantum many-body scars. Our experiments show that this approach significantly outperforms the adiabatic algorithm, illustrating that such quantum quench algorithms can provide a shortcut to adiabaticity for large-scale many-body quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold atoms are crucial for unlocking truly precise and accurate quantum metrology, and provide an essential platform for quantum computing, communication and memories. One of the largest ongoing challenges is the miniaturization of these quantum devices. Here, we show that the typically macroscopic optical lattice architecture at the heart of many ultra-precise quantum technologies can be realized with a single input laser beam on the same diffractive chip already used to create the ultracold atoms. Moreover, this inherently ultra-stable platform enables access to a plethora of new lattice dimensionalities and geometries, ideally suited for the design of high-accuracy, portable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantum Analogue Simulation of Many-Body Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analogue simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our work defines a route for quantum analogue simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

      <title>Effects of alloying elements on carbon diffusion in the austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TThe effects of alloying elements on diffusion pathways and migration energies of interstitial carbon in austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) are studied using density functional theory first-principles calculations. The binding energies between carbon and alloying elements are determined through 6th nearest-neighbor (NN) distances. The elements studied are Ni, Mo, V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Al, Ti, and Si, relevant to most high-strength steels. Nickel, Mn, Al, and Si have repulsive binding energies; Mo, V, Cr, Cu, and Ti have attractive binding energies in austenite and ferrite. Alloying elements at 1st NN sites of a C atom in an octahedral site introduce asymmetry into the minimum energy diffusion pathway, causing up to about 1 eV changes in saddle-point energies. This pathway goes from one octahedral site to another via intermediate energy states, differing for austenite and ferrite. We find that the elements with attractive binding energies increase the energy barrier for C migration resulting in decelerated carbon diffusion, while the elements with repulsive binding energies decrease the energy barrier for C migration leading to accelerated C diffusion. The magnitude of changes in C migration energies is proportional to the binding energies between C and alloying elements. Among the three austenite stabilizers, Ni and Mn are C diffusion accelerators, while Cu decelerates C diffusion in austenite. Among the four ferrite stabilizers, Si is a C diffusion accelerator, while V and Ti serve as C diffusion decelerators in ferrite. Aluminum has no significant effect on C's diffusivity, while Mo and Cr decelerate C diffusion.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavefunction effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose gauge-independent tensors describing Bloch wavefunction effects on local interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the wavefunction effects are featured by the eigenfrequency, amplitude, and phase shift of an excited breathing mode and can be observed in experiments. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice with nontrivial wavefunction effects. Our discovery advances the connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>
