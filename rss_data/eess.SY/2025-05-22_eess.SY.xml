      <title>Gaussian Processes in Power Systems: Techniques, Applications, and Future Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) has significantly heightened operational complexity and uncertainty in modern power systems. Concurrently, the widespread deployment of smart meters, phasor measurement units (PMUs) and other sensors has generated vast spatiotemporal data streams, enabling advanced data-driven analytics and decision-making in grid operations. In this context, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged as a powerful probabilistic framework, offering uncertainty quantification, non-parametric modeling, and predictive capabilities to enhance power system analysis and control. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GP techniques and their applications in power system operation and control. GP applications are reviewed across three key domains: GP-based modeling, risk assessment, and optimization and control. These areas serve as representative examples of how GP can be utilized in power systems. Furthermore, critical challenges in GP applications are discussed, and potential research directions are outlined to facilitate future power system operations.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver (HA), Fujitsu's Digital Annealer V3 (DAv3), and Fujitsu's Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Local Energy Market Clearing Framework Using a Two-Loop ADMM Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of prosumers' resources in energy communities can provide significant technical and economic benefits to both prosumers and the distribution system operator (DSO). To maximize these benefits, a coordination framework is required to address all techno-economic constraints as well as the objectives of all agents. This paper presents a fully distributed market-clearing scheme to coordinate the strategies of agents within a local energy community. In the proposed framework, prosumers, the DSO, and the local market operator (LMO) are the participating agents. The framework addresses the preferences and techno-economic constraints of all actors while preserving their privacy. The proposed model is based on a modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method with two outer and inner loops; the outer loop models the interactions between the LMO and prosumers, while the inner loop addresses the interactions between the LMO and the DSO. The model is demonstrated on IEEE-69bus test network, showcasing its effectiveness from various perspectives.</description>

      <title>Partitioning and Observability in Linear Systems via Submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network partitioning has gained recent attention as a pathway to enable decentralized operation and control in large-scale systems. This paper addresses the interplay between partitioning, observability, and sensor placement (SP) in dynamic networks. The problem, being computationally intractable at scale, is largely unexplored in the literature. To that end, the paper's objective is designing scalable partitioning of linear systems while maximizing observability metrics of the subsystems. We show that the partitioning problem can be posed as a submodular maximization problem -- and the SP problem can subsequently be solved over the partitioned network. Consequently, theoretical bounds are derived to compare observability metrics of the original network with those of the resulting partitions, highlighting the impact of partitioning on system observability. Case studies on networks of varying sizes corroborate the derived theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Efficient Aggregation of Energy-Constrained Flexible Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loads represent a promising flexibility source to support the integration of renewable energy sources, as they may shift their energy consumption over time. By computing the aggregated flexibility of power and energy-constrained loads, aggregators can communicate the group's flexibility without sharing individual private information. However, this computation is, in practice, challenging. Some studies suggest different inner approximations of aggregated flexibility polytopes, but all suffer from large computational costs for realistic load numbers and horizon lengths. In this paper, we develop a novel approximation of the aggregated flexibility of loads based on the concept of worst-case energy dispatch, i.e., if aggregated energy consumptions are assumed to be dispatched in the worst manner possible. This leads to conservative piecewise linear bounds that restrict the aggregated energy consumption only based on the previous aggregated energy consumed. A comparative case study reveals that our method can compute an approximation of the aggregation of thousands of loads efficiently, while displaying an accuracy comparable to other approximation techniques.</description>

      <title>Coverage Path Planning For Multi-view SAR-UAV Observation System Under Energy Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging can effectively enhance the performance of tasks such as automatic target recognition and image information fusion. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantages of flexible deployment and cost reduction. A swarm of UAVs equipped with synthetic aperture radar imaging equipment is well suited to meet the functional requirements of multi-view synthetic aperture radar imaging missions. However, to provide optimal paths for SAR-UAVs from the base station to cover target viewpoints in the mission area is of NP-hard computational complexity. In this work, the coverage path planning problem for multi-view SAR-UAV observation systems is studied. First, the coordinate of observation viewpoints is calculated based on the location of targets and base station under a brief geometric model. Then, the exact problem formulation is modeled in order to fully describe the solution space and search for optimal paths that provide maximum coverage rate for SAR-UAVs. Finally, an Adaptive Density Peak Clustering (ADPC) method is proposed to overcome the additional energy consumption due to the viewpoints being far away from the base station. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced for optimal path generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</description>

      <title>Robust Look-ahead Pursuit Control for Three-Dimensional Path Following within Finite-Time Stability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of robust path following for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments with bounded external disturbances and non-smooth predefined paths. Due to the unique aerodynamic characteristics and flight constraints of fixed-wing UAVs, achieving accurate and stable path following remains difficult, especially in low-altitude mountainous terrains, urban landscapes, and under wind disturbances. Traditional path-following guidance laws often struggle with rapid stabilization and constrained input commands under unknown disturbances while maintaining robustness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a robust nonlinear path-following guidance law that considers the flight path angle and track angle, and dynamically adjusts controller parameters to achieve optimal compensation for acceleration increments. The proposed guidance law guarantees finite-time stability, reduced sensitivity to constrained uncertainties, and consistent behavior compared to traditional asymptotic convergence controllers. Additionally, it ensures that the UAV approaches mobile virtual target points in the shortest possible time while adhering to input constrained conditions. Our contributions include a thorough analysis of the conditions for robust stability, the derivation of the guidance law, and simulations demonstrating its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed guidance law significantly improves path-following performance under external disturbances, making it a promising solution for autonomous missions execution of fixed-wing UAVs.</description>

      <title>Neural network based control of unknown nonlinear systems via contraction analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the design of neural network (NN)-based controllers for unknown nonlinear systems, using contraction analysis. A Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) system is constructed by approximating the unknown draft dynamics with a feedforward NN. Incremental sector bounds and contraction theory are applied to the activation functions and the weights of the NN, respectively. It is demonstrated that if the incremental sector bounds and the weights satisfy some non-convex conditions, the NODE system is contractive. To improve computational efficiency, these non-convex conditions are reformulated as convex LMI conditions. Additionally, it is proven that when the NODE system is contractive, the trajectories of the original autonomous system converge to a neighborhood of the unknown equilibrium, with the size of this neighborhood determined by the approximation error. For a single-layer NN, the NODE system is simplified to a continuous-time Hopfield NN. If the NODE system does not satisfy the contraction conditions, an NN-based controller is designed to enforce contractivity. This controller integrates a linear component, which ensures contraction through suitable control gains, and an NN component, which compensates for the NODE system's nonlinearities. This integrated controller guarantees that the trajectories of the original affine system converge to a neighborhood of the unknown equilibrium. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Data Center Model for Transient Stability Analysis of Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising demand of computing power leads to the installation of a large number of Data Centers (DCs). Their Fault-Ride-Through (FRT) behavior and their unique power characteristics, especially for DCs catered to Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, pose a threat to the stability of power systems. To ensure its stability, it is required accurate models of the loads involved. Here we propose a dynamic load model that properly captures the behaviour of DCs. Its three most defining features are the use of an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) which sits between the server load and the grid, the cooling load represented by an induction motor, and a pulsing load that represents the transients caused by contemporary DCs with significant AI workloads. The features of the proposed model and its impact on the dynamic performance of transmission systems are illustrated through a model of the all-island Irish transmission system and real-world data of the DCs currently connected to this system.</description>

      <title>On the Deployment of RIS-mounted UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enable smart wireless environments by dynamically controlling signal propagation to enhance communication and localization. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as flying base stations and thus, improve system performance by avoiding signal blockages. In this paper, we propose a gradient ascent and coordinate search based method to determine the optimal location for a system that consists of a UAV and a RIS, where the UAV serves cellular users (CUs) and the RIS serves device-to-device (D2D) pairs. In particular, by optimizing the net throughput for both the D2D pairs and the CUs, the suggested method establishes the ideal location for the RIS-mounted UAV. We consider both line of sight (LoS) and non-LoS paths for the RIS and UAV to calculate the throughput while accounting for blockages in the system. The numerical results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing approaches in terms of both the net throughput and the user fairness.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Constraint-Aware Control of Pressure Dynamics in Water Electrolysis Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of pressure constraint violations in water electrolysis systems operating under dynamic power conditions, a problem common to both Proton Exchange Membrane and alkaline technologies. To investigate this issue, a control-oriented model of an alkaline electrolyzer is developed, capturing key pressure and flow dynamics. To manage rapid power fluctuations that may cause pressure to exceed manufacturer-defined operational boundaries, a model-based constraint-aware power governor based on the Reference Governor (RG) framework is proposed. Simulation results show that the strategy effectively maintains pressure within the specified operating range, outperforming conventional filtering methods while enhancing hydrogen production and reducing auxiliary energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Delayed dynamic-feedback controller design for multi-frequency vibration suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for designing a dynamic controller with delayed output feedback for achieving non-collocated vibration suppression with a focus on the multi-frequency case. To synthesize the delay-based controller, we first remodel the system of equations as a delay-differential algebraic equation (DDAE) in such a way that existing tools for design of a static output feedback controller can be easily adapted. The problem of achieving non-collocated vibration suppression with sufficient damping is formulated as a constrained optimization problem of minimizing the spectral abscissa in the presence of zero-location constraints, with the constraints exhibiting polynomial dependence on its parameters. We transform the problem into an unconstrained one using elimination, following which we solve the resulting non-convex, non-smooth optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Resource Allocation for QoS and Stability in Dynamic VLC-NOMA Networks via MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) combined with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution for dense indoor wireless networks. Yet, managing resources effectively is challenged by VLC network dynamic conditions involving user mobility and light dimming. In addition to satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability requirements. Traditional resource allocation methods and simpler RL approaches struggle to jointly optimize QoS and stability under the dynamic conditions of mobile VLC-NOMA networks. This paper presents MARL frameworks tailored to perform complex joint optimization of resource allocation (NOMA power, user scheduling) and network stability (interference, handovers), considering heterogeneous QoS, user mobility, and dimming in VLC-NOMA systems. Our MARL frameworks capture dynamic channel conditions and diverse user QoS , enabling effective joint optimization. In these frameworks, VLC access points (APs) act as intelligent agents, learning to allocate power and schedule users to satisfy diverse requirements while maintaining network stability by managing interference and minimizing disruptive handovers. We conduct a comparative analysis of two key MARL paradigms: 1) Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) and 2) Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE). Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both tailored MARL frameworks and demonstrate an ability to handle complex optimization. The results show key trade-offs, as the CTDE approach achieved approximately 16\% higher for High priority (HP) user QoS satisfaction, while the CTCE approach yielded nearly 7 dB higher average SINR and 12\% lower ping-pong handover ratio, offering valuable insights into the performance differences between these paradigms in complex VLC-NOMA network scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constant-Sum High-Order Barrier Functions for Safety Between Parallel Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper takes a step towards addressing the difficulty of constructing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for parallel safety boundaries. A single CBF for both boundaries has been reported to be difficult to validate for safety, and we identify why this challenge is inherent. To overcome this, the proposed method constructs separate CBFs for each boundary. We begin by presenting results for the relative degree one case and then extend these to higher relative degrees using the CBF backstepping technique, establishing conditions that guarantee safety. Finally, we showcase our method by applying it to a unicycle system, deriving a simple, verifiable condition to validate the target CBFs for direct implementation of our results.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking for PDE Systems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremum Seeking (ES) is an effective real-time optimization method for PDE systems in cascade with nonlinear quadratic maps. To address PDEs in the feedback loop, a boundary control law and a re-design of the additive probing signal are mandatory. The latter, commonly called "trajectory generation" or "motion planning," involves designing perturbation signals that anticipate their propagation through PDEs. Specifically, this requires solving motion planning problems for systems governed by parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) is a powerful tool for solving PDEs by embedding physical laws as constraints in the neural network's loss function, enabling efficient solutions for high-dimensional, nonlinear, and complex problems. This paper proposes a novel construction integrating PINN and ES, automating the motion planning process for specific PDE systems and eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical derivations. The proposed strategy efficiently extracts perturbation signals, optimizing the PDE system.</description>

      <title>Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning for Medical Treatment Optimization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios, the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL) attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories, thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety. First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions, it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.</description>

      <title>Performance Guaranteed Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning: A Sliding Mode Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS) issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by 10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state, achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fish have endured millions of years of evolution, and their distinct rigid-flexible body structures offer inspiration for overcoming challenges in underwater robotics, such as limited mobility, high energy consumption, and adaptability. This paper introduces SpineWave, a biomimetic robotic fish featuring a fish-spine-like rigid-flexible transition structure. The structure integrates expandable fishbone-like ribs and adjustable magnets, mimicking the stretch and recoil of fish muscles to balance rigidity and flexibility. In addition, we employed an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the hydrodynamics of the robot, achieving significant improvements in swimming performance. Real-world tests demonstrated robustness and potential for environmental monitoring, underwater exploration, and industrial inspection. These tests established SpineWave as a transformative platform for aquatic robotics.</description>

      <title>MEbots: Integrating a RISC-V Virtual Platform with a Robotic Simulator for Energy-aware Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Platforms (VPs) enable early software validation of autonomous systems' electronics, reducing costs and time-to-market. While many VPs support both functional and non-functional simulation (e.g., timing, power), they lack the capability of simulating the environment in which the system operates. In contrast, robotics simulators lack accurate timing and power features. This twofold shortcoming limits the effectiveness of the design flow, as the designer can not fully evaluate the features of the solution under development. This paper presents a novel, fully open-source framework bridging this gap by integrating a robotics simulator (Webots) with a VP for RISC-V-based systems (MESSY). The framework enables a holistic, mission-level, energy-aware co-simulation of electronics in their surrounding environment, streamlining the exploration of design configurations and advanced power management policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16649v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We then compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.</description>

      <title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07065v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Choose Wisely: Data-driven Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems Using Online Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes Select-Data-driven Predictive Control (Select-DPC), a new method for controlling nonlinear systems using output-feedback for which data are available but an explicit model is not. At each timestep, Select-DPC employs only the most relevant data to implicitly linearize the dynamics in "trajectory space". Then, taking user-defined output constraints into account, it makes control decisions using a convex optimization. This optimal control is applied in a receding-horizon manner. As the online data-selection is the core of Select-DPC, we propose and verify both norm-based and manifold-embedding-based selection methods. We evaluate Select-DPC on three benchmark nonlinear system simulators -- rocket-landing, a robotic arm and cart-pole inverted pendulum swing-up -- comparing them with standard Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and Time-Windowed DeePC methods, and find that Select-DPC outperforms both methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are crucial for frequency and voltage stability in modern power systems. However, their performance under overload conditions remains a challenge. This paper highlights the limitations of existing approaches in managing DC source saturation and AC current limits, emphasizing the need for improved control strategies to ensure system stability. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. This approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increase where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control with an improvement of 0.245 Hz in frequency and 0.03 p.u. in active power when compared to an already existing current limitation strategy. Additionally, it reduces peak voltage deviations during transients by 24.14\%, lowers the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) from 0.02 Hz/s to 0.005 Hz/s, and improves the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. These improvements significantly enhance system resilience, especially in inertia-less power networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system in real time, which helps mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances. However, existing work models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which does not faithfully model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems framework for modeling feedback optimization of linear time-invariant systems that are subject to unknown, constant disturbances. For this setup, we first establish the well-posedness of the hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then, our main result derives a convergence rate and an error bound for the full hybrid computation-in-theloop system and shows that it converges exponentially towards a ball of known radius about a desired fixed point. Simulation results show that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances, with the magnitude of steady-state error being 81% less than the magnitude of the disturbances in the system.</description>

      <title>Regularized Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC), the choice of cost-weighting matrices and designing the Hessian matrix directly affects the trade-off between rapid state regulation and minimizing the control effort. However, traditional MPC in quadratic programming relies on fixed design matrices across the entire horizon, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This letter presents a Riccati equation-based method for adjusting the design matrix within the MPC framework, which enhances real-time performance. We employ a penalized least-squares (PLS) approach to derive a quadratic cost function for a discrete-time linear system over a finite prediction horizon. Using the method of weighting and enforcing the constraint equation by introducing a large penalty parameter, we solve the constrained optimization problem and generate control inputs for forward-shifted horizons. This process yields a recursive PLS-based Riccati equation that updates the design matrix as a regularization term in each shift, forming the foundation of the regularized MPC (Re-MPC) algorithm. To accomplish this, we provide a convergence and stability analysis of the developed algorithm. Numerical analysis demonstrates its superiority over traditional methods by allowing Riccati equation-based adjustments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven method for finding a closed-loop optimal controller, which minimizes a specified infinite-horizon cost function for systems with unknown dynamics given any arbitrary initial state. Suppose the closed-loop optimal controller can be parameterized by a given class of functions, hereafter referred to as the policy. The proposed method introduces a novel gradient estimation framework, which approximates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters via integrating the Koopman operator with the classical concept of actor-critic. This enables the policy parameters to be tuned iteratively using gradient descent to achieve an optimal controller, leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator. The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is provided. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through comparisons with a model-free reinforcement learning approach, and its control performance is further evaluated through simulations against model-based optimal control methods that solve the same optimal control problem utilizing the exact system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distributed alternating gradient descent for convex semi-infinite programs over a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a first-order distributed algorithm for solving a convex semi-infinite program (SIP) over a time-varying network. In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.</description>

Abstract: Mobile smartphones compactly provide sensors such as cameras, IMUs, GNSS measurement units, and wireless and wired communication channels required for robotics projects. They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper, consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements. Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter, are included.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of the TGOSPA metric for multiple target tracking via unbalanced optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multiple target tracking, it is important to be able to evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment metric (TGOSPA) is a recently proposed metric for such evaluations. The TGOSPA metric is computed as the solution to an optimization problem, but for large tracking scenarios, solving this problem becomes computationally demanding. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for evaluating the TGOSPA metric, based on casting the TGOSPA problem as an unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport problem. Following recent advances in computational optimal transport, we introduce an entropy regularization and derive an iterative scheme for solving the Lagrangian dual of the regularized problem. Numerical results suggest that our proposed algorithm is more computationally efficient than the alternative of computing the exact metric using a linear programming solver, while still providing an adequate approximation of the metric.</description>

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons have significant potential in labor-intensive fields by mitigating hand grip fatigue, enhancing hand strength, and preventing injuries. However, most of the traditional hand exoskeletons are driven by motors, whose output force is limited in the constrained installation conditions. Besides, they also come with the disadvantages of high power consumption, complex and bulky assistive systems, and high instability. In this work, we develop a novel hand exoskeleton integrated with magnetorheological (MR) clutches that offers a high force-to-power ratio to improve grip endurance. The clutch features an enhanced structure design, a micro roller enhancing structure, which can significantly boost output forces. The experimental data demonstrate that the clutch can deliver a peak holding force of 380 N with a 1.48 W consumption, yielding a force-to-power ratio of 256.75N/W, which is 2.35 times higher than the best-reported actuator used for hand exoskeletons. This capability enables the designed MRHE to provide approximately 419.79 N support force for gripping. The designed MR hand exoskeleton is highly integrated, comprising an exoskeleton frame, MR clutches, a control unit, and a battery. Evaluations through static grip endurance tests and dynamic carrying and lifting tests confirm that the MR hand exoskeleton can effectively reduce muscle fatigue, extend grip endurance, and minimize injuries. These findings highlight its strong potential for practical applications in repetitive tasks such as carrying and lifting in industrial settings.</description>
