      <title>Topological superfluid phases of attractive Fermi-Hubbard model in narrow-band cold-atom optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of attractive Hubbard interaction on two-component fermionic atoms in narrow two-dimensional (2D) energy bands that exhibit Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the presence of an applied Zeeman field. This narrow-band 2D spin-orbit coupled attractive Fermi-Hubbard model can potentially be realized in cold atom systems in optical lattices with artificially engineered Rashba SOC and Zeeman field. Employing a self-consistent mean field approximation for the pairing potential, we uncover a complex phase diagram featuring various topological superfluid (TS) phases, dependent on the chemical potential and the Zeeman field. We focus on the pairing potential and the corresponding quasiparticle gap characterizing the TS phases, which are notably small for a wide-band model with quadratic dispersion near the $\Gamma$-point, as found in earlier work, and we identify the parameter regimes that maximize the gap. We find that, while generally the value of the pairing potential increases with the reduction of the fermionic bandwidth, as expected for narrow- or flat-band systems, the magnitude of the topological gap characterizing the TS phases reaches a maximum of about $10-12.5\%$ of the interaction strength at finite values of the hopping amplitude, Rashba coupling, and Zeeman field.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Doppler effect in superfluid and supersolid atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Doppler effect at zero temperature in superfluids with broken Galilean invariance and hosting permanent currents, with special focus on atomic gas platforms. We consider the case when Galilean invariance is broken explicitly (by an external periodic potential) or spontaneously, as it happens in a supersolid. In the first case, the presence of a stationary current affects the propagation of sound (fourth sound) via an anomalous Doppler term proportional to the density derivative of the superfluid fraction. In supersolids, where, according to Goldstone theorem, distinct sounds of hybrid superfluid and crystal nature can propagate, the Doppler effect can be very different for each sound, including the possibility of being negative for the lower phonon branch. We obtain analytical predictions within the hydrodynamic theories for superfluids and supersolids, which are compared with the numerical results of time-dependent simulations for weakly interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap regime of the unitary Fermi gas with lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary Fermi gas (UFG) is a strongly correlated system of two-species (spin-1/2) fermions with a short-range attractive interaction modeled by a contact interaction and has attracted much interest across different disciplines. The UFG is considered a paradigm for strongly correlated superfluids and has been investigated extensively, with generally good agreement found between theory and experiment. However, the extent of a pseudogap regime above the critical temperature $T_c$ for superfluidity is still debated both theoretically and experimentally. Here we study thermodynamic properties of the UFG across the superfluid phase transition using finite-temperature lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods in the canonical ensemble of fixed particle numbers. We extrapolate our lattice AFMC results to the continuous time and continuum limits, thus removing the systematic error associated with the finite filling factor of previous AFMC studies. We determine the critical temperature to be $T_c=0.16(1)\, T_{F}$. For the largest particle number studied $N=114$, the energy-staggering pairing gap is suppressed above a pairing scale temperature of $T^{*}\approx 0.2\,T_F$. The spin susceptibility displays moderate suppression above $T_c$ with a spin gap temperature of $T_s\approx 0.2 \,T_F$. We also calculate a free energy-staggering pairing gap, which shows substantially reduced statistical errors when compared with the energy-staggering gap, allowing for a clear signature of pairing correlations in the finite-size system. All results indicate that the pseudogap regime is narrow, with pseudogap signatures emerging at temperatures below $T^{*}\approx 0.2 \, T_F$. The reduced statistical errors of the free energy gap enable an extrapolation at low temperatures, allowing an estimate of the zero-temperature pairing gap $\Delta_E = 0.576(24) \, \epsilon_F$.</description>

      <title>Order and disorder in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Heavy-light $N+1$ clusters of two-dimensional fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study binding of $N$ identical heavy fermions by a light atom in two dimensions assuming zero-range attractive heavy-light interactions. By using the mean-field theory valid for large $N$ we show that the $N+1$ cluster is bound when the mass ratio exceeds $1.074N^2$. The mean-field theory, being scale invariant in two dimensions, predicts only the shapes of the clusters leaving their sizes and energies undefined. By taking into account beyond-mean-field effects we find closed-form expressions for these quantities. We also discuss differences between the Thomas-Fermi and Hartree-Fock approaches for treating the heavy fermions.</description>

      <title>Two atoms in a harmonic trap with spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of two harmonically trapped atoms in the presence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum (SOAM) coupling. The two-body energy spectrum is numerically calculated by utilizing the exact diagonalization method. We analyze how the degeneracy of energy levels is lifted under the interplay between the interatomic interaction and SOAM coupling. The exact numerical results show excellent agreement with that of perturbation theory in the weak-interaction limit as well as that in the absence of SOAM coupling. The properties of correlations between the two atoms are also discussed with respect to the interaction strength. The findings in this paper may provide valuable insights into few-body physics subjected to SOAM coupling and the possible experimental detection of spectrum functions in many-body systems, such as radiofrequency spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Theory of Strongly Correlated Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report reviews recent progress in computing Kubo formulas for general interacting Hamiltonians. The aim is to calculate electric and thermal magneto-conductivities in strong scattering regimes where Boltzmann equation and Hall conductivity proxies exceed their validity. Three primary approaches are explained.
  1. Degeneracy-projected polarization formulas for Hall-type conductivities, which substantially reduce the number of calculated current matrix elements. These expressions generalize the Berry curvature integral formulas to imperfect lattices. 2. Continued fraction representation of dynamical longitudinal conductivities. The calculations produce a set of thermodynamic averages, which can be controllably extrapolated using their mathematical relations to low and high frequency conductivity asymptotics. 3. Hall-type coefficients summation formulas, which are constructed from thermodynamic averages.
  The thermodynamic formulas are derived in the operator Hilbert space formalism, which avoids the opacity and high computational cost of the Hamiltonian eigenspectrum. The coefficients can be obtained by well established imaginary-time Monte Carlo sampling, high temperature expansion, traces of operator products, and variational wavefunctions at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of approaches 1--3 by their application to well known models of lattice electrons and bosons. The calculations clarify the far-reaching influence of strong local interactions on the metallic transport near Mott insulators. Future directions for these approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Amplification and Estimation using a Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum kicked rotor (QKR) is a fundamental model of time-dependent quantum chaos and the physics of Anderson localization. It is one of the most well-studied Floquet systems. In this work, it is shown that QKR can be used to implement a quantum algorithm to perform unstructured search; namely Amplitude Amplification, a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. Further, the QKR is employed for amplitude estimation when the amplitude of the marked states is unknown. It is also shown that the characteristic property of dynamical localization of the QKR can be exploited to enhance the performance of the amplitude amplification algorithm by reducing its average runtime. The sensitivity of the success probability of unstructured search to detuning from resonance and the effects of noisy kick strengths are analyzed and the robustness of the QKR based algorithm is demonstrated. The experimental feasibility of every component of the algorithm is discussed.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of noninteracting electrons, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry; we further generalize the conclusion to interacting systems for the case where there is one atom per unit cell. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures the integrated quantum metric exclusively. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free-fermions, we unveil a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>
