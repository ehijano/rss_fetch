      <title>Hole subband dispersions and strong `spin'-orbit coupling in a cylindrical Ge nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional hole gas is achievable in semiconductor nanowire structures. This paper briefly reviews both the calculation method and the low-energy effective description of the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical Ge nanowire. Using the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, two transcendental equations determining the subband dispersions are analytically derived. Subband dispersions for three representative growth directions [001], [111], and [110] are given. The lowest two subband dispersions are shown to be two shifted parabolic curves with an anticrossing at $k_{z}R=0$. This peculiar low-energy subband structure manifests the existence of a strong `spin' (pseudo spin)-orbit coupling, although each dispersion line is spin degenerate. Either a strong longitudinal or a strong transverse magnetic field is used to lift this spin degeneracy, such that two sets of combined dispersions modelled by a two-band Hamiltonian $H^{\rm ef}=\hbar^{2}k^{2}_{z}/(2m^{*}_{h})+\alpha\sigma^{x}k_{z}+g^{*}_{h}\mu_{B}B\sigma^{z}/2$ are obtainable. These results are further confirmed via constructing the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of the hole gas, where the explicit expressions of $\alpha$ and $g^{*}_{h}$ are also given.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of magnetic spin Hall angle by extrinsic surface roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect arises from a reactive counterpart of the dissipative spin response that is responsible for the ordinary spin Hall effect. This interpretation is supported by the dependence of spin Hall effect signals on the reversal of magnetic order parameters and can be explained in terms of the symmetries of well-defined linear response functions. This proposal has enabled the generation and manipulation of spin currents electrically. In terms of conversion efficiency, the spin Hall angle is a key parameter used to characterize a material's ability to convert spin currents to charge currents and vice versa. Consequently, there is an ongoing effort to identify mechanisms that can increase the spin Hall angle. In theis work, it is proposed a mechanism based on extrinsic surface roughness, which enhances the magnetic spin Hall angle when the ratio of roughness to thickness is high. This mechanism represents an important discovery that will advance the development of charge-to-spin devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Dirac Sea on Phase Transitions in Monolayer Graphene under Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments have found Kekul\'e-Distorted (KD) ordering in graphene subjected to strong magnetic fields, a departure from the antiferromagnetic (AF) state identified in earlier transport experiments on double-encapsulated devices with larger dielectric screening constant $\epsilon$. This variation suggests that the magnetic anisotropic energy is sensitive to dielectric screening constant. To calculate the magnetic anisotropic energy without resorting to perturbation theory, we adopted a two-step approach. First, we derived the bare valley-sublattice dependent interaction coupling constants from microscopic calculations and account for the leading logarithmic divergences arising from quantum fluctuations by solving renormalization group flow equations in the absence of magnetic field from the carbon lattice scale up to the much larger magnetic length. Subsequently, we used these renormalized coupling constants to perform non-perturbative, self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations. Our results demonstrate that the ground state at neutrality ($\nu=0$) transitions from a AF state to a spin-singlet KD state when dielectric screening and magnetic fields become small, consistent with experimental observations. For filling fraction $\nu=\pm1$, we predict a transitions from spin-polarized charge-density wave states to spin-polarized KD state when dielectric screening and magnetic fields become small. Our self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, which encompass a large number of Landau levels, reveal that the magnetic anisotropic energy receives substantial contributions from the Dirac sea when $\epsilon$ is small. Our work provides insights into how the Dirac sea, which contributes to one electron per graphene unit cell, affects the small magnetic anisotropic energy in graphene.</description>

      <title>Large Twist Angle dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics and Raman studies on MoSe2/WSe2 van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ({\theta}) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moir\'e potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying {\theta}. Apart from the magic angles of {$\sim$}3$^{\circ}$ and {$\sim$}57.5$^{\circ}$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe2 bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^{\circ}$ and 38.2$^{\circ}$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons (twisted MoSe2 /WSe2 HS). We report a non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy of MoSe2/WSe2 HS at large twist angles. The recombination time of interlayer excitons reaches a minima near commensurate angles. Raman spectroscopy reveals an opposite shift in the A1g modes of MoSe2 and WSe2, with the maximum shift occurring in the vicinity of twist angles of 21.8$^{\circ}$ and 38.2$^{\circ}$. At these commensurate angles, maximum charge transfer increases Coulomb screening, reducing the interlayer exciton lifetime. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Engineering superconducting contacts transparent to a bipolar graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene's exceptional electronic mobility, gate-tunability, and contact transparency with superconducting materials make it ideal for exploring the superconducting proximity effect. However, the work function difference between graphene and superconductors causes unavoidable doping of graphene near contacts, forming a p-n junction in the hole-doped regime and reducing contact transparency. This challenges the device implementation that exploits graphene's bipolarity. To address this limitation, we developed a new fabrication scheme for two-dimensional superconducting contacts that allows independent control over charge concentration and polarity for both the graphene in contact with superconductors and the graphene channel. Contact transparency, conductance enhancement, and Josephson coupling were measured to confirm transparent contacts to both polarities of graphene. Moreover, we demonstrated the Andreev process in the quantum Hall edge state at a negative filling factor of {\nu} = -2. This scheme will open avenues for realizing various theoretical propositions utilizing the bipolarity of graphene combined with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of helical states revealed by crossed Andreev reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge states of a quantum spin Hall insulator exhibit helical properties, which has generated significant interest in the field of spintronics. Although it is predicted theoretically that Rashba spin-orbit coupling can effectively regulate edge state spin, experimental characterization of this spin control remains challenging. Here, we propose utilizing crossed Andreev reflection to probe the efficiency of gate voltage control on edge state spin. We calculate the transport properties of the quantum spin Hall isolators-superconductor heterojunction by using non-equilibrium Green's function method. We find that the probabilities of crossed Andreev reflection, electron transmission, and non-local conductance all include the relative spin rotation angle $\theta$ caused by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the helical edge states. Notably, when the incident energy is close to the superconducting gap, the differential conductance $G_2\propto-\cos{\theta}$. Thus, the influence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on edge state spin can be quantitatively characterized by crossed Andreev reflection, which provides a feasible scheme for experimental testing.</description>

      <title>Wideband wide-field imaging of spin-wave propagation using diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging spin-wave propagation in magnetic materials in a wide frequency range is crucial for understanding and applying spin-wave dynamics. Recently, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have attracted attention as sensors capable of quantitatively measuring the amplitude and phase of coherent spin waves. However, the conventional sensing protocol has been limited to detecting spin waves whose frequencies match the resonance frequency of the NV spins. We demonstrate that by utilizing the AC Zeeman effect, it is possible to image spin waves propagating in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film over a wide frequency range up to a maximum detuning of 567 MHz without changing the external magnetic field. Our results expand the applicability of NV centers for spin-wave sensing and pave the way for quantitative investigations of the dynamics in various magnetic materials, such as metallic ferromagnets and van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Second Harmonic Generation in Topological Insulators under Quantizing Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the second harmonic generation (SHG) of topological insulator surface states in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our theory is based on the microscopic expression of the second-order magneto-optical conductivity developed from the density matrix formalism, taking into account hexagonal warping effects on the surface states' band structure. Using numerically exact Landau level energies and wavefunctions including hexagonal warping, we calculate the spectrum of SHG conductivities under normal incidence for different values of magnetic field and chemical potential. The imaginary parts of the SHG conductivities show prominent resonant peaks corresponding to one-photon and two-photon inter-Landau level transitions. Treating the hexagonal warping term perturbatively, these transitions are clarified analytically within a perturbation theory from which approximate selection rules for the allowable optical transitions for SHG are determined. Our results show extremely high SHG susceptibility that is easily tunable by magnetic field and doping level for topological surface states in the far-infrared regime, exceeding that of many conventional nonlinear materials. This work highlights the key role of hexagonal warping effects in generating second-order optical responses and provides new insights on the nonlinear magneto-optical properties of the topological insulators.</description>

      <title>One dimensional chains of nickelocene fragments on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature-dependent deposition of nickelocene (NiCp$_2$) molecules on a single crystal Au(111) substrate, revealing distinct adsorption behaviors and structural formations. At low temperatures (4.2 K), individual NiCp$_2$ molecules adsorb on the herringbone elbows and step edges, forming ordered patterns as molecular coverage increases. However, at 77 K, the molecules dissociate, yielding two main fragments: NiCp fragments that are Ni atoms capped by cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings, which preferentially adsorb at FCC hollow sites, and Cp radical fragments exhibiting strong substrate interactions. NiCp fragments self-assemble into one-dimensional (1-D) chains along the $\langle 1 1 \bar{2} \rangle$ directions, displaying higher protrusion in STM images. The strain and steric hindrance from the Cp protons induce chiral patterns within the chains, which are well-reproduced by our DFT simulations. In contrast, the Cp fragments maintain distances due to short-range repulsive forces and exhibit low diffusion barriers. Interestingly, the fragments are non-magnetic, as confirmed by both STM measurements and DFT calculations, in contrast to the magnetic signals from intact Nc molecules. In addition to linear chains, dimers of the Ni-Cp fragments form along the $\langle 1 \bar{1} 0\rangle$ directions, requiring gold adatoms for their creation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing complex nanostructures based on metallocenes via on-surface synthesis, opening the possibility for realizing low-dimensional magnetic systems by selecting substrates that preserve the magnetic moment of the fragments.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Quantum Electrodynamics with Moir\'e Flatband Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\'e patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\'e photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\'e cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\'e cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\'e flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</description>

      <title>Mobility edges in pseudo-unitary quasiperiodic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Floquet quasicrystal that simulates the motion of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field in discrete time steps. We admit the hopping to be non-reciprocal which, via a generalized Aubry duality, leads us to push the phase that parametrizes the synthetic dimension off of the real axis. This breaks unitarity, but we show that the model is still ``pseudo-unitary''. We unveil a novel mobility edge between a metallic and an insulating phase that sharply divides the parameter space. Moreover, for the first time, we observe a second transition that appears to be unique to the discrete-time setting. We quantify both phase transitions and relate them to properties of the spectrum. If the hopping is reciprocal either in the lattice direction or the synthetic dimension, the model is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, and the spectrum is confined to the unit circle up to a critical point. At this critical point, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is spontaneously broken and the spectrum leaves the unit circle. This transition is topological and measured by a spectral winding number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical evidence of tilting effect in coupled Weyl bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories have revealed the universality of the band tilting effect in topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and its implications for the material's physical properties. However, the experimental identification of tilted Weyl bands remains much less explored. Here, by combining magneto-infrared optical studies with a four-band coupled Weyl point model, we report spectroscopic evidence of the tilting effect in the well-established WSM niobium phosphide. Specifically, we observe Landau level transitions with rich features that are well reproduced within a model of coupled tilted Weyl points. Our analysis indicates that the tilting effect relaxes the selection rules and gives rise to transitions that would otherwise be forbidden in the non-tilt case. Additionally, we observe unconventional interband transitions with flat and negative magnetic field dispersions, highlighting the importance of coupling between Weyl points. Our results not only emphasize the significance of the tilting effect in the optical responses of WSMs but also demonstrate magneto-optics as an effective tool for probing the tilting effect in electronic band structures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat bands in two-dimensional fused pentagon network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical quest of flat-band tight-binding models usually relies on lattice structures on which electrons reside. Typical examples of candidate lattice structures include the Lieb-type lattices and the line graphs. Meanwhile, there can be accidental flat-band systems that belong to neither of such typical classes and deriving flat-band energies and wave functions for such systems is not straightforward. In this work, we investigate the characteristic band structure for the tight-binding model on a network composed of pentagonal rings, which is inspired by the theoretically-predicted carbon-based material. Although the lattice does not belong to conventional classes of flat band models, the exact flat bands appear only for fine-tuned parameters. We analytically derive the exact eigenenergies and eigenstates of the flat bands. By using the analytic form of the Bloch wave function, we construct the corresponding Wannier function and reveal its characteristic real-space profile. We also find that, even away from the exact flat-band limits, the nearly flat band exists near the Fermi level for the half-filled systems, which indicates that the present system will be a suitable platform for questing flat-band-induced correlated electron physics if it is realized in the real material.</description>

      <title>Quantum Orbital-State Control of a Neutral Nitrogen-Vacancy Center at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neutral nitrogen-vacancy center (NV$^0$) is promising for realizing strong coupling with a single microwave photon due to its large electric field sensitivity, although it is susceptible to environmental phonon noise at 5 K. Decreasing the temperature to 15 mK results in a tenfold increase in orbital relaxation time compared to that at 5 K. Dynamical decoupling pulses significantly increase the orbital coherence time to around 1.8 $\mu$s, representing a 30-fold improvement compared to that without decoupling pulses. Based on these results, a single NV$^0$ can reach the strong coupling regime when coupled with a high-impedance microwave resonator, thus opening up the possibility of microwave quantum electrodynamics using a single optically-active defect center in diamond.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons in chiral crystal structures can acquire a circular polarization, becoming chiral themselves. Chiral phonons carry a spin angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to the electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites comprise a class of direct band gap semiconductors that can easily be forced into a chiral structure by incorporating chiral organic cations into the crystal. The degree of chirality can be tuned by modifying the organic cations. We reveal chiral phonons in such 2D perovskites, using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields based on density functional theory calculations. We find that particularly the low energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework of the perovskites, are chiral. In the presence of a temperature gradient, a substantial angular momentum density can be induced, which is measurable in experiment.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ferroelectric topological insulator as verified by quantum Hall effect of surface states in (Sn,Pb,In)Te films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent phenomena arising from nontrivial band structures based on topology and symmetry have been attracting keen interest in contemporary condensed-matter physics. Materials such as SnTe and PbTe are one such example, which demonstrate a topological phase transition while showing ferroelectric instability derived from their rock-salt structure. The ferroelectricity can lift the valley degeneracy, enabling the emergence of the Z2 topological insulator phase, although its observation in transport phenomena remains elusive. Here, we report magnetotransport properties of ferroelectric (Sn,Pb)Te thin films with finely-controlled Fermi levels via In doping. We identified the ferroelectric topological insulator phase from the observations of the quantum Hall states with filling factors of $\nu$ = 1, 2 and 3 with both spin- and valley-degeneracy lifting. The electronic states are two-dimensional, indicating the ferroelectricity-induced topological surface states with a single Dirac cone. The finding of the new topological state with ferroelectricity will further expand the field of topological physics and advance the development of functional properties, such as topological nonlinear photonics and nonreciprocal transport with memory effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet their underlying physical mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the ${PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>High-precision Quantum Monte-Carlo study of charge transport in a lattice model of molecular organic semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use first-principle Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations and numerical exact diagonalization to analyze the low-frequency charge carrier mobility within a simple tight-binding model of molecular organic semiconductors on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. These compounds feature transient localization, an unusual charge transport mechanism driven by dynamical disorder. The challenges of studying the transient localization of charge carriers in the low-frequency/long-time limit from first principles are discussed. We demonstrate that a combination of high-precision QMC data with prior estimates of frequency-dependent charge carrier mobility based on the static disorder approximation for phonon fields allows for improved estimates of mobility in the low-frequency limit. We also point out that a simple relaxation time approximation for charge mobility in organic semiconductors is not consistent with the QMC data. Physical similarities with charge transport in quark-gluon plasma are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous van der Waals altermagnetism with sliding/moire ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the recent studies on sliding/moire ferroelectricity, most 2D van der Waals nonferroelectric monolayers can become ferroelectric via multilayer stacking. In this paper we propose that similar strategy can be used to induce desirable van der Waals altermagnetism with symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders and non-relativistic spin splitting. Our first-principles calculations show the pervasive co-existence of sliding ferroelectricity and altermagnetism in a series of magnetic multilayers with anti-parallel stacking configurations. Upon a twist angle in bilayers, moire ferroelectricity can be combined with altermagnetism, while some untwisted bilayers exhibit pseudo-altermagnetism with zero net magnetizations and non-relativistic spin splittings coupled with sliding ferroelectricity. Our study significantly expands the scope of altermagnetism, and its combination with sliding/moire ferroelectricity brings in new physics as well as promising applications, which should stimulate further experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Scanning Thermal Microscopy in Air and Vacuum: A Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements comparing scanning thermal microscopy in air and vacuum. Signal levels are compared and resolution is probed by scanning over the edge of a nanofabricated Ag square embedded in SiO2. Signals measured in air were seen to be 2.5 to 40 times larger than in vacuum. Furthermore, the air signals were stable while the vacuum signals varied significantly. Edge widths measured in air were approximately 39 % larger than those measured in vacuum. Our observations are consistent with the air measurements experiencing heat transfer from the surrounding sample via conduction and convection as well as the formation of a water-related meniscus at the tip-sample junction. These results contribute to the understanding of the complex heat exchange effects that can occur in scanning thermal microscopy when it is conducted in an ambient atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Magnetochiral Charge Pumping due to Charge Trapping and Skin Effect in Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) generates giant spin polarization in transport through chiral molecules, paving the way for novel spintronic devices and enantiomer separation. Unlike conventional transport, CISS magnetoresistance (MR) violates Onsager's reciprocal relation, exhibiting significant resistance changes when reversing electrode magnetization at zero bias. However, its underlying mechanism remains unresolved. In this work, we propose that CISS MR originates from charge trapping that modifies the electron tunneling barrier and circumvents Onsager's relation, distinct from previous spin polarization-based models. Charge trapping is governed by the non-Hermitian skin effect, where dissipation leads to exponential wavefunction localization at the ferromagnet-chiral molecule interface. Reversing magnetization or chirality alters the localization direction, changing the occupation of impurity/defect states in the molecule (i.e., charge trapping) -- a phenomenon we term magnetochiral charge pumping. Our theory explains why CISS MR can far exceed the ferromagnet spin polarization and why chiral molecules violate the reciprocal relation but chiral metals do not. Furthermore, it predicts exotic phenomena beyond the conventional CISS framework, including asymmetric MR induced by magnetic fields alone (without ferromagnetic electrodes), as confirmed by recent experiments. This work offers a deeper understanding of CISS and opens avenues for controlling electrostatic interactions in chemical and biological systems through the magnetochiral charge pumping.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for non-Hermitian continuum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most pronounced non-Hermitian phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect, which refers to the exponential localization of bulk eigenstates near the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems. Whereas non-Bloch band theory has been developed to describe the non-Hermitian skin effect in lattice systems, its counterpart in continuum systems still lacks a quantitative characterization. Here, we generalize the non-Bloch band theory to non-Hermitian continuum systems. In contrast to lattice systems for which the bulk Hamiltonian alone determines the non-Hermitian skin effect and energy spectrum, we find for continuum systems that the number of boundary conditions, i.e., the number of independent differential equations satisfied by wavefunctions at two boundaries, must also be included as essential information. We show that the appropriate discretization of continuum systems into lattice models requires matching the hopping range of the latter with the number of boundary conditions in the former. Furthermore, in periodic non-Hermitian continuum systems, we highlight the application of the transfer matrix in determining the generalized Brillouin zone. Our theory serves as a useful toolbox for investigating the rich non-Bloch physics in non-Hermitian continuum systems, such as photonic crystals, elastic media, and certain cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge stability diagrams in coupled quantum dot qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict large regions of the charge stability diagram using a multi-band and multi-electron configuration interaction model of a double quantum dot system. We account for many-body interactions within each quantum dot using full configuration interaction and solve for single-particle density operators. This allows charge states to be predicted more accurately than the extensively used classical capacitance model or the single-band Hubbard model. The resulting single-particle mixed states then serve as inputs into an atomic orbital picture that allows for the explicit calculation of the underlying Hubbard model parameters by performing the appropriate integrals. This numerical approach allows for arbitrary choices of electrostatic potential and gate geometry. A common assumption when calculating charge stability diagrams from the Hubbard model is that the charge stability diagrams are periodic, but we find that the tunnel couplings for valence electrons in dots with $N=3$ electrons are significantly enhanced when compared to single-electron dots. This difference is apparent in the charge stability diagram for higher occupancy Coulomb diamonds. We also quantitatively explore how the barrier gate strength and dot pitch impact this behavior. Our work should help improve the future realistic modeling of semiconductor-dot-based quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among all materials, mono-crystalline diamond has one of the highest measured thermal conductivities, with values above 2000 W/m/K at room temperature. This stems from momentum-conserving `normal' phonon-phonon scattering processes dominating over momentum-dissipating `Umklapp' processes, a feature that also suggests diamond as an ideal platform to experimentally investigate phonon heat transport phenomena that violate Fourier's law. Here, we introduce dilute nitrogen-vacancy color centers as in-situ, highly precise spin defect thermometers to image temperature inhomogeneities in single-crystal diamond microstructures heated from ambient conditions. We analyze cantilevers with cross-sections in the range from about 0.2 to 2.6 $\mathrm{\mu m}^2$, observing a relation between cross-section and heat flux that departs from Fourier's law predictions. We rationalize such behavior relying on first-principles simulations based on the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation, also discussing how fabrication-induced impurities influence conduction. Our temperature-imaging method can be applied to diamond devices of arbitrary geometry, paving the way for the exploration of unconventional, non-diffusive heat transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent Topological Phases and Flat Bands in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as an extraordinary platform for investigating exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, mainly due to the existence of topological surface flatbands. Despite extensive research efforts, a systematic spectroscopic investigation on the evolution of its electronic structure from thin layers to bulk remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution, we directly probe and trace the thickness evolution of the topological electronic structures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. As the layer number increases, the gapped subbands transform into the 3D Dirac nodes that spirals in the momentum space; while the flatbands are constantly observed around Fermi level, and eventually evolve into the topological drumhead surface states. This unique thickness-dependent topological phase transition can be well captured by the 3D generalization of 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain in thin layers, to the topological Dirac nodal spiral semimetal in the bulk limit. Our findings establish a solid foundation for exploring the exotic quantum phases with nontrivial topology and correlation effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a minimal lattice model to provide an orbital description of lowest and first Landau levels. With the maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, $p_+$ orbital characteristics, a three-orbital model is developed, where the lowest two Chern bands are flat with $\mathcal{C}=1$. This model can be viewed as consecutive band inversions between these Wannier states at $\Gamma$ and $K$ in momentum space, which adiabatically connects the atomic insulator limit to Landau level physics. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that the Abelian states can appear in the 1/3-filled lowest Chern band, while the signatures of the non-Abelian states are found in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further extended to realize flat Chern bands resembling the higher Landau levels. Our results offer a new perspective to understand the lattice analogue of Landau levels, potentially enabling the realization of the fascinating topological phenomena at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>3-Dimensional Model Based Iterative Reconstruction of Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Holographic Vector Field Electron Tomography Measurements</title>

Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ degree tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional electron in the quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electron spin dynamics whose movement is restricted to the lowest one dimensional subband channel ($G \le 2e^2/h $), through nuclear spin relaxation rate measurement ($1/T_1$). We observe an unusual double-peak structure in the $1/T_1$ profile below the lowest subband level, where the up and down spin edge channel is still largely overlap. This profile significantly deviates from the behavior predicted by a non-interacting electron model, in which the only source of relaxation is through thermal fluctuations near the Fermi level. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical calculations, suggest that enhanced electron-electron interactions at the center of a quantum point contact are the likely origin of the observed double-peak structures.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Engineering efficient light sources for silicon photonics: III-V nano-heterostructures monolithically grown on silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nano-heterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a compelling platform for both classical and quantum technologies. In particular, the past decade has witnessed a surge of novel ideas and developments, which may be overwhelming for newcomers to the field. This review provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and key applications of hBN, including quantum sensing, quantum key distribution, quantum computing, and quantum memory. Additionally, we highlight critical experimental and theoretical advances that have expanded the capabilities of hBN, in a cohesive and accessible manner. The objective is to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of the diverse applications of hBN, and provide insights into ongoing research efforts.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>
