      <title>Neutron Counting Statistics calculations Using Deterministic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a number of applications like low-source reactor start-up or neutron coincidence counting it is necessary to take into account the stochastic nature of neutron transport and go beyond the average neutron density, which is solution of a linear Boltzmann equation. In this work, we are particularly interested in calculating the moments and probabilities of the number of neutrons detected during a time window. It is known that in case of a single initial neutron these quantities are solution of a system of coupled adjoint transport equations and that a neutron source can be taken into account in a second time using summations with the source strength. The purpose of the present work is first to present the derivation of these equations in a form where they can be solved up an arbitrary order and where the fission terms are expanded according to the moments of the fission multiplicity. For simplicity, the derivation is first presented in a lumped also called point model approximation before considering the full phase-space case. Thereafter, we describe the implementation of the solution algorithm in the deterministic, discrete ordinates code PANDA and finally, we present some numerical results and inter-code comparisons for verification purposes and to illustrate the applicability of the method.</description>

      <title>Iterative variational learning of committor-consistent transition pathways using artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a neural-network-based approach to discover meaningful transition pathways underlying complex biomolecular transformations in coherence with the committor function. The proposed path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) iteratively refines the transition pathway by aligning it to the gradient of the committor. This method addresses the challenges of sampling in molecular dynamics simulations rare events in high-dimensional spaces, which is often limited computationally. Applied to various benchmark potentials and biological processes such as peptide isomerization and protein-model folding, PCCANN successfully reproduces established dynamics and rate constants, while revealing bifurcations and alternate pathways. By enabling precise estimation of transition states and free-energy barriers, this approach provides a robust framework for enhanced-sampling simulations of rare events in complex biomolecular systems.</description>

      <title>Designing Optically Addressable Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Ultra-Small Nanodiamonds: Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasmall nanodiamonds (USNDs) are promising platforms for fluorescent and quantum sensing applications. Here we present first-principles electronic structure calculations of color centers in USNDs, specifically the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) and we investigate their optical addressability as a function of the surface termination. We consider both isolated nanoparticles and arrays of USNDs with different degrees of packing, and we include quantum vibronic effects in our analysis, using stochastic methods. We find that the NV in USNDs can be stabilized in a negative charge state if the nanoparticles are terminated by fluorine, hydroxyl, and ether. While fluorine terminations can be used for fluorescent bio-tags, we suggest that hydroxyl and ether terminations are beneficial for quantum sensing applications. We also find that the NV- can be stabilized in arrays of USNDs when inter-particle separations are larger than the diameter of the nanoparticle. Interestingly, the phonon renormalizations of single-particle energy levels found in arrays contribute to the charge stability of negatively charged NV centers.</description>

      <title>A simple tool for the optimization of 1D phononic and photonic bandgap filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective computational tool for simulating the scattering of 1D waves by a composite layer architected in an otherwise homogeneous medium. The layer is designed as the union of segments cut from various mother periodic media, which allows us to describe the wavefield in each segment in terms of the ``left'' and ``right'' Bloch waves. For a given periodic medium and frequency of oscillations, the latter are computed by solving the quadratic eigenvalue problem which seeks the wavenumber -- and affiliated eigenstate -- of a Bloch wave. In this way the scattering problem is reduced to a low-dimensional algebraic problem, solved via the transfer matrix approach, that seeks the amplitudes of the featured Bloch waves, amplitude of the reflected wave, and that of the transmitted wave. Such an approach inherently caters for an optimal filter design as it enables rapid exploration of the design space with respect to segment (i) permutations, (ii) cut lengths, and (iii) cut offsets relative to the mother periodic media. Specifically, under (i)--(iii) the Bloch eigenstates remain invariant, so that only the transfer matrices need to be recomputed. The reduced order model is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Example simulations demonstrate 40x computational speedup when optimizing a 1D filter for minimum transmission via a genetic algorithm approach that entails $O(10^6)$ trial configurations. Relative to the classical rainbow trap design where the unit cells of the mother periodic media are arranged in a ``linear'' fashion according to their dispersive characteristics, the GA-optimized (rearranged) configuration yields a $40\%$ reduction in filter transmissibility over the target frequency range, for the same filter thickness.</description>

      <title>Goupil: A Monte Carlo engine for the backward transport of low-energy gamma-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goupil is a software library designed for the Monte Carlo transport of low-energy gamma-rays, such as those emitted from radioactive isotopes. The library is distributed as a Python module. It implements a dedicated backward sampling algorithm that is highly effective for transporting photons in low density media. In the air, computation time savings of five orders of magnitude are achieved while maintaining an accuracy comparable to that of conventional Monte Carlo methods, to the nearest percent.</description>

      <title>A time-discontinuous elasto-plasticity formalism to simulate instantaneous plastic flow bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic flow is conventionally treated as continuous in finite element (FE) codes, whether in isotropic, anisotropic plasticity, or crystal plasticity. This approach, derived from continuum mechanics, contradicts the intermittent nature of plasticity at the elementary scale. Understanding crystal plasticity at micro-scale opens the door to new engineering applications, such as microscale machining. In this work, a new approach is proposed to account for the intermittence of plastic deformation while remaining within the framework of continuum mechanics. We introduce a material parameter, the plastic deformation threshold, denoted as $\Delta p_{min}$, corresponding to the plastic deformation carried by the minimal plastic deformation burst within the material. The incremental model is based on the traditional predictor-corrector algorithm to calculate the elastoplastic behavior of a material subjected to any external loading. The model is presented within the framework of small deformations for von Mises plasticity. To highlight the main features of the approach, the plastic strain increment is calculated using normality rule and consistency conditions, and is accepted only if it exceeds $\Delta p_{min}$. To achieve this, a time-discontinuous generalization of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is proposed. The simulations show that the introduction of the plastic threshold allows for the reproduction of the spatiotemporal intermittence of plastic flow, capturing the self-organization of plastic flow in complex loading scenarios within an FE model.</description>

      <title>Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient interphase percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and hence tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. Past works have shown that particle functionalization can help tweak these interactions in attractive or repulsive directions and can produce slow or fast decay of stiffness properties in polymer nanocomposites. In absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. The interfacial elastoplastic material model is devised by combining local stiffness and glass transition measurements that were obtained by previous researchers by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. This is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are processing artefacts that result from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking symbolic regression constant optimization schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is a machine learning technique, and it has seen many advancements in recent years, especially in genetic programming approaches (GPSR). Furthermore, it has been known for many years that constant optimization of parameters, during the evolutionary search, greatly increases GPSR performance However, different authors approach such tasks differently and no consensus exists regarding which methods perform best. In this work, we evaluate eight different parameter optimization methods, applied during evolutionary search, over ten known benchmark problems, in two different scenarios. We also propose using an under-explored metric called Tree Edit Distance (TED), aiming to identify symbolic accuracy. In conjunction with classical error measures, we develop a combined analysis of model performance in symbolic regression. We then show that different constant optimization methods perform better in certain scenarios and that there is no overall best choice for every problem. Finally, we discuss how common metric decisions may be biased and appear to generate better models in comparison.</description>

      <title>Thermal state structure in the Tavis--Cummings model and rapid simulations in mesoscopic quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand the behavior of them in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily, in specific we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than priorly considered. When in such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. These enable efficient numeric methods for obtaining certain parameters that scale as $O(\sqrt{N})$, and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms and inefficient methods likely are needed to be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for differentiating shapes represented in binary images with respect to their parameters. This framework functions as an automatic differentiation tool for shape parameters, generating both binary density maps for optical simulations and computing gradients when the simulation provides a gradient of the density map. Our algorithm enables robust gradient computation that is insensitive to the image's pixel resolution and is compatible with all density-based simulation methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and generalizability of our differential shape algorithm using photonic designs with different shape parametrizations across several differentiable optical solvers. We also demonstrate a substantial reduction in optimization time using our gradient-based shape optimization framework compared to traditional black-box optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme for multi-scale phonon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of the spatiotemporal distributions of temperature are crucial to the multi-scale thermal management and safe operation of microelectronic devices. To realize it, an efficient semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for numerically solving the transient phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from the ballistic to diffusive regime. The phonon BTE at the cell center is discretized under the framework of finite volume method, where the trapezoidal and midpoint rules are used to deal with the temporal integration of phonon scattering and convection terms, respectively. For the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function, the phonon BTE at the cell interface is discretized in the form of finite difference method and solved numerically, where second-order upwind and central scheme are used to deal with the spatial interpolation and gradient of interfacial distribution function, respectively. The macroscopic governing equations are invoked for the evolution of macroscopic fields at both the cell center and interface, where the macroscopic flux is obtained by taking the moment of the interfacial distribution function. Numerical results show that the present scheme could accurately predict the steady/unsteady heat conduction in solid materials from the ballistic to diffusive regime, and its time and cell size are not limited by the relaxation time and phonon mean free path. The present work could provide a useful tool for the efficient predictions of the macroscopic spatiotemporal distributions in the multi-scale thermal engineering.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Impacts Single-Molecule FRET Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first principle physics and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume. Our models provide the most up-to-date and accurate estimation of FRET.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature. We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram (helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases, RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange case.</description>

Abstract: The inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) presents distinctive computational challenges, including their large memory requirements. Advancements in the two-photon polymerization (2PP) fabrication process introduce additional complexity, necessitating the development of more flexible optimization algorithms to enable the creation of multi-material 3D structures with unique properties. This paper presents a memory efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation framework for finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations that is able to handle complex constraints arising from novel fabrication methods. Our method is based on straight-through gradient estimation that enables non-differentiable shape parametrizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating increasingly complex structures to solve the coupling problem in PICs. The results highlight the potential of our method for future PIC design and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Memory Lifetime with Measurement-Free Local Error Correction and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09524</link>

Abstract: Reliable quantum computation requires systematic identification and correction of errors that occur and accumulate in quantum hardware. To diagnose and correct such errors, standard quantum error-correcting protocols utilize $\textit{global}$ error information across the system obtained by mid-circuit readout of ancillary qubits. We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on $\textit{local}$ error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the 2D classical Ising model and 4D toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared to a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a sub-threshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory. Finally, we discuss the application of the LEC protocol on dissipative preparation of quantum states with topological phases.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Extending the FDTD GVADE method nonlinear polarization vector to include anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector, the nonlinear electric dipole moment per unit volume, is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the numerical method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then example simulation results are presented for two isotropic media. First, the simplified 2D transverse magnetic case is revisited for the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper, including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector in the simulation; the simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with the purely isotropic polarization vector simulation results. Second, a simplified 2D transverse magnetic example was simulated in carbon disulfide, with its strong molecular re-orientation induced polarization anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent System for Cosmological Parameter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multiple Large Language Model agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation and that can execute code locally may become beneficial in cosmological data analysis. Here, we illustrate a first small step towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to automate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system architecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2 framework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific research. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological parameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum likelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our work-in-progress code is open source and available at https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent.</description>

      <title>Double Layer-Interlocked Crystals of Nitrogen-Rich Compounds under Zero-Pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is a key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2 nitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by sharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero pressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below 250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the ionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer from Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way for atomic level advancements in HEDMs.</description>
