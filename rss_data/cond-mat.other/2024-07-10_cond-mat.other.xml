      <title>Spin-3/2 nuclear magnetic resonance: Exact solutions for aligned systems and implications for probing Fe-based superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of spin-3/2 nuclei in a static magnetic field aligned with one of the electric field gradient (EFG) principal axes is developed analytically, based on fictitious spin-1/2 formalism. Compact closed-form expressions for the eigenstates and transitions frequencies, as well as the expectation value of the magnetic moment after resonant excitation, are derived. Emphasis is placed on defining and interpreting the associated Rabi frequencies, as a function of excitation direction and ellipticity. It is found transitions inherently fall into two subsets, depending on their sensitivity to excitation direction, with the Rabi frequency of one subset directly depending on the asymmetry of the EFG. A natural application is the study of Fe-based superconductors, whose antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures leads to a strong intrinsic magnetic field aligned with the EFG principal axes. Zero external-field NMR spectra, from powder samples of two such Fe-based superconductors, BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and CaFe$_2$As$_2$, are analyzed and exemplify the simplicity in extracting the internal magnetic field, the quadrupole coupling constant, and the EFG asymmetry parameter, which are important for studying magnetic ordering, structural properties, phase transitions, and NMR dynamics. Results compare favorably to conventional high-field NMR experiments done with the rotation of single crystals. Overall, the physical insights, afforded by the exact and concise expressions, will lead to ready interpretation of spin-3/2 spectra as well as precipitate new experimental directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum turbulence in axially rotating thermal counterflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation, statistically steady state, and temporal decay of axially rotating thermal counterflow of superfluid $^4$He (He~II) in a square channel is probed using the second sound attenuation technique, measuring the density of quantized vortex lines. The array of rectilinear quantized vortices created by rotation strongly affects the development of quantum turbulence. At relatively slow angular velocities, the type of instability responsible for the destruction of the laminar counterflow qualitatively changes: the growth of seed vortex loops pinned on the channel wall becomes gradually replaced by the growth due to Donnelly-Glaberson instability, which leads to rapid growth of helical Kelvin waves on vortices parallel with applied counterflow. The initial transient growth of vortex line density that follows the sudden start of the counterflow appears self-similar, linear in dimensionless time, $\Omega t$. We show numerically that Kelvin waves of sufficiently strong amplitude reorient the vortices into more flattened shapes, which grow similarly to a free vortex ring. The observed steady state vortex line density at sufficiently high counterflow velocity and its early temporal decay after the counterflow is switched off is not appreciably affected by rotation. It is striking, however, that although the steady state of rotating counterflow is very different from rotating classical grid-generated turbulence, the late temporal decay of both displays similar features: the decay exponent decreases with the rotation rate $\Omega$ from -3/2 towards approximately -0.7, typical for two-dimensional turbulence, consistent with the transition to bidirectional cascade.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and energy propagation in a dielectric medium supporting magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a dielectric medium supporting a magnetic current in connection with optical properties and energy propagation. The dispersion relations, propagating modes, and some optical effects are examined for isotropic and anisotropic magnetic conductivity tensors, with the latter ones implying nonreciprocal permittivities. The eigenvalues of the effective permittivity are carried out and associated with the optical symmetries (uniaxial, biaxial) and the subjacent crystal systems. Aspects of electromagnetic energy transport for such systems are also discussed, with the group and energy velocities being presented and carried out for all the particular cases addressed. Our results suggest that a dielectric supporting magnetic current breaks the usual equivalence between group velocity and energy velocity that holds in a nonabsorbing medium, while establishing the equivalence between them in an effective absorbing scenario, two unexpected behaviors.</description>
