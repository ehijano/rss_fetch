      <title>A Radio Technosignature Search of TRAPPIST-1 with the Allen Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-planet occultations (PPOs) occur when one exoplanet occults another exoplanet in the same system as seen from the Earth's vantage point. PPOs may provide a unique opportunity to observe radio "spillover" from extraterrestrial intelligences' (ETIs) radio transmissions or radar being transmitted from the further exoplanet towards the nearer one for the purposes of communication or scientific exploration. Planetary systems with many tightly packed, low-inclination planets, such as TRAPPIST-1, are predicted to have frequent PPOs. Here, the narrowband technosignature search code turboSETI was used in combination with the newly developed NbeamAnalysis filtering pipeline to analyze 28 hours of beamformed data taken with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) during late October and early November 2022, from 0.9--9.3~GHz, targeting TRAPPIST-1. During this observing window, 7 possible PPO events were predicted using the NbodyGradient code. The filtering pipeline reduced the original list of 25 million candidate signals down to 6 million by rejecting signals that were not sky-localized and, from these, identified a final list of 11127 candidate signals above a power law cutoff designed to segregate signals by their attenuation and morphological similarity between beams. All signals were plotted for visual inspection, 2264 of which were found to occur during PPO windows. We report no detection of signals of non-human origin, with upper limits calculated for each PPO event exceeding EIRPs of 2.17--13.3 TW for minimally drifting signals and 40.8--421 TW in the maximally drifting case. This work constitutes the longest single-target radio SETI search of TRAPPIST-1 to date.</description>

      <title>Constraining atmospheric composition from the outflow: helium observations reveal the fundamental properties of two planets straddling the radius gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-836 is a $\sim2-3$ Gyr K dwarf with an inner super Earth ($R=1.7\,R_\oplus$, $P=3.8\,d$) and an outer mini Neptune ($R=2.6\,R_\oplus$, $P=8.6\,d$). Recent JWST/NIRSpec 2.8--5.2 $\mu$m observations have revealed flat transmission spectra for both planets. We present Keck/NIRSPEC observations of escaping helium from this system. While planet b shows no absorption in the 1083 nm line to deep limits ($&lt;0.2$\%), 836c shows strong (0.7\%) absorption in both visits. These results demonstrate that the inner super-Earth has lost its primordial atmosphere while the outer mini-Neptune has not. Self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamic models of c using pyTPCI, an updated version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface, reveal that the helium signal is highly sensitive to metallicity: its equivalent width collapses by a factor of 13 as metallicity increases from 10x to 100x solar, and by a further factor of 12 as it increases to 200x solar. The observed equivalent width is 88\% of the model prediction for 100x metallicity, suggesting that c may have an atmospheric metallicity close to 100x solar. This is similar to K2-18b and TOI-270d, the first two mini-Neptunes with detected absorption features in JWST transmission spectra. We highlight the helium triplet as a potentially powerful probe of atmospheric composition, with complementary strengths and weaknesses to atmospheric retrievals. The main strength is its extreme sensitivity to metallicity in the scientifically significant range of 10--200x solar, and the main weakness is the enormous model uncertainties in outflow suppression and confinement mechanisms, such as magnetic fields and stellar winds.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Relationship Between Rocky Exoplanet and Stellar Compositions: Reduced Evidence for a Super-Mercury Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets and the stars they orbit are born from the same cloud of gas and dust, and the primordial compositions of rocky exoplanets have been assumed to have iron and refractory abundance ratios consistent with their host star. To test this assumption, we modeled the interior iron-to-rock ratio of 20 super-Earth sized (1-1.8R$_{\oplus}$) exoplanets around stars with homogeneously measured stellar parameters. We computed the core mass fraction for each planet and an equivalent ``core mass fraction'' for each host star based on its Fe and Mg abundances. We then fit a linear correlation using two methods (Ordinary Least Squares and Orthogonal Distance Regression) between planetary and stellar core mass fraction, obtaining substantially different slopes between these two methods (m=1.3 $\pm$ 1.0 and m=5.6 $\pm$ 1.6, respectively). Additionally, we find that 75$\%$ of planets have a core mass fraction consistent with their host star to within 1$\sigma$, and do not identify a distinct population of high-density super-Mercuries. Overall, we conclude that current uncertainties in observational data and differences in modeling methods prevent definitive conclusions about the relationship between between planet and host star chemical compositions.</description>

      <title>3D Radiation-Hydrodynamical Simulations of Shadows on Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan$^{-1}$($c_s$/$v_\phi$) (6$^{\circ}$ if $h/r$=0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$ in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity-pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10% of the sound speed, which can be probed by ALMA line observations.</description>

      <title>Is there a genetic relationship between chondrules and matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chondritic components such as chondrules and matrix are the key time capsules that can help us understand the evolution and dynamics of the protoplanetary disk from which the Solar System originated. Knowledge of where and how these components formed and to what extent they were transported in the gaseous disk provides major constraints to astrophysical models that investigate planet formation. Here, we explore whether chondrules and matrix are genetically related to each other and formed from single reservoirs per chondrite group or if every chondrite represents a unique proportion of components transported from a small number of formation reservoirs in the disk. These static versus dynamic disk interpretations of cosmochemical data have profound implications for the accretion history of the planets in the Solar System. To fully understand the relationship between chondrules and matrix and their potential complementarity, we dive into the petrological nature and origin of matrix, the chemical and isotopic compositions of chondrules and matrix and evaluate these data considering the effect of secondary alteration observed in chondrites and the potential complexity of chondrule formation. Even though we, the authors, have used different datasets and arrived at differing interpretations of chondrule-matrix relationships in the past, this review provides clarity on the existing data and has given us new directions towards future research that can resolve the complementarity debate.</description>

      <title>Minimum Safe Distances for DE-STAR Space Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of phased laser arrays in space has received considerable attention in recent years, with applications to both planetary defence and space exploration. The most detailed investigation conducted into such a design is that of the DE-STAR phased array, standing for $\textbf{D}$irected $\textbf{E}$nergy $\textbf{S}$ystems for $\textbf{T}$argeting of $\textbf{A}$steroids and explo$\textbf{R}$ation. DE-STAR is a square modular design which exploits the energy created by banks of solar cells in space to generate and amplify the power of a laser beam. A specific DE-STAR design is expressed as DE-STAR n, where 'n' (typically in the range 0 - 4) equates to the log to base 10 of the side, in metres, of a square bank of lasers. With a DE-STAR 4 structure (10 km $\times$ 10 km square) capable of generating a laser beam on the order of tens of gigawatts, clearly there is the potential for such an asset to be deployed as a weapon by targeting locations on Earth. This naturally leads to the question of what effective ways can this possible misuse be removed or at least mitigated, to ensure these powerful space lasers can only be used for their intended purpose, and never malevolent reasons. One solution would be to locate the DE-STAR far enough away so that the laser flux at Earth would be too low. Results indicate that given they should lie 1 au from the Sun, there are feasible locations for DE-STAR 0-2 arrays where there is no danger to Earth. For DE-STAR 4-5, such is their power, safety measures other than those considered here would have to be adopted. Positions in the Solar System where the DE-STAR lasers have no direct line-of-sight with Earth tend to be unstable, and would require regular corrections using an on-board propulsion system, or preferably using push-back from the laser itself.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically buoyantly driven and are strongly constrained by planetary rotation at large scales. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory studies of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation (Ekman numbers $\rm Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $\rm Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are significantly smaller. Reduced equations of motion, the non-hydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations describing the leading-order behavior in the limit of rapid rotation ($\rm Ek \to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, leaving the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $\rm Ek$ currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE), a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $\rm Ek\to 0$. We provide the first full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $\rm Ek=10^{-15}$ and below and show that the RiNSE converge to the asymptotically reduced equations.</description>

      <title>The Radius Distribution of M dwarf-hosted Planets and its Evolution</title>

Abstract: M dwarf stars are the most promising hosts for detection and characterization of small and potentially habitable planets, and provide leverage relative to solar-type stars to test models of planet formation and evolution. Using \emph{Gaia} astrometry, adaptive optics imaging, and calibrated gyrochronologic relations to estimate stellar properties and filter binaries we refined the radii of 117 Kepler Objects of Interest (confirmed or candidate planets) transiting 74 single late K- and early M-type stars, and assigned stellar rotation-based ages to 113 of these. We constructed the radius distribution of 115 small ($&lt;4R_{\oplus}$) planets and assessed its evolution. As for solar-type stars, the inferred distribution contains distinct populations of "super-Earths" (at $\approx$1.3$_{\oplus}$) and "sub-Neptunes" (at $\approx$2.2$R_{\oplus}$) separated by a gap or "valley" at $\approx$1.7$_{\oplus}$ that has a period dependence that is significantly weaker (power law index of -0.03$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$) than for solar-type stars. Sub-Neptunes are largely absent at short periods ($&lt;$2 days) and high irradiance, a feature analogous to the "Neptune desert" observed around solar-type stars. The relative number of sub-Neptunes to super-Earths declines between the younger and older halves of the sample (median age 3.86 Gyr), although the formal significance is low ($p = 0.08$) because of the small sample size. The decline in sub-Neptunes appears to be more pronounced on wider orbits and low stellar irradiance. This is not due to detection bias and suggests a role for H$_2$O as steam in inflating the radii of sub-Neptunes and/or regulating the escape of H/He from them.</description>

      <title>A New Parameterization for Finding Solutions for Microlensing Exoplanet Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational microlensing method of discovering exoplanets and multi-star systems can produce degenerate solutions, some of which require in-depth analysis to uncover. We propose a new parameter space that can be used to sample potential solutions more efficiently and is more robust at finding all degenerate solutions. We identified two new parameters, k and h, that can be sampled in place of the mass ratios and separations of the systems under analysis to identify degenerate solutions. The parameter k is related to the size of the central caustic, $\Delta\xi_c$, while h is related to the distance of a point along the k contour from log(s)=0, where s is the projected planet-host separation. In this work, we present the characteristics of these parameters and the tests we conducted to prove their efficacy.</description>

      <title>The Role of Thermal Feedback in the Growth of Planetary Cores by Pebble Accretion in Dust Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution millimetre-imaging of protoplanetary discs has revealed many containing rings and gaps. These rings can contain large quantities of dust, often in excess of 10M$_\oplus$, providing prime sites for efficient and rapid planet formation. Rapid planet formation will produce high accretion luminosities, heating the surrounding disc. We investigate the importance of a planetary embryo's accretion luminosity by simulating the dynamics of the gas and dust in a dust ring, accounting for the energy liberated as a resident planetary embryo accretes. The resulting heating alters the flow structure near the planet, increasing the accretion rate of large, millimetre-to-centimetre-sized dust grains. We show how this process varies with the mass of dust in the ring and the local background gas temperature, demonstrating that the thermal feedback always acts to increase the planet's mass. This increase in planet mass is driven primarily by the formation of vortices, created by a baroclinic instability once the accreting planet heats the disc significantly outside its Hill radius. The vortices can then migrate with respect to the planet, resulting in a complex interplay between planetary growth, gap-opening, dust trapping and vortex dynamics. Planets formed within dust traps can have masses that exceed the classical pebble isolation mass, potentially providing massive seeds for the future formation of giant planets. Once pebble accretion ceases, the local dust size distribution is depleted in large grains, and much of the remaining dust mass is trapped in the system's L$_5$ Lagrange point, providing potentially observable signatures of this evolution.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Solar Radiation on the Martian Upper Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first in-situ measurements of the altitude profile of Martian upper atmospheric density and composition were carried out by the Viking lander missions in 1976. The MAVEN and MOM spacecraft launched in September 2014 with mass spectrometers and solar radiation measuring payloads have vastly expanded this initial database. Using a rare set of near-simultaneous data from these two orbiters, we find that there is either an increasing (e.g., for $CO_2$ and $Ar$) or a decreasing (e.g., for $O$) trend of the density profiles by a factor of 2 between June 1 to June 15, 2018, in the height region of $\sim$150-300 km. A time series analysis of the concurrent in-situ solar EUV spectral flux and the $H^+$ ion velocities of the incident solar wind measured near MAVEN periapsis showed the former going through a decrease of only $\sim$10\% compared to the latter's decrease by a factor of 4 within the same non-solar-flare period of observation. The estimates of standard errors and the use of linear regression analysis for the correlation coefficients between densities and solar radiation components have been carried out. Invoking simple photochemical equilibrium conditions with the dissociation of $CO_2$ (producing $CO$ and $O$) through solar EUV radiation and the solar wind $H^+$ ion impact process, the day-to-day variations of these constituents are estimated. The high and significant anti-correlation between the density variations of $CO_2$ and $O$ due to the dissociation of $CO_2$ by the solar wind particle radiation is clearly demonstrated. The cause for the increasing densities of $Ar$ like that of $CO_2$ during this period is more complex and would likely be governed by the temperature variations due to absorption of solar EUV/charged particle radiation and other interacting dynamical effects.</description>
