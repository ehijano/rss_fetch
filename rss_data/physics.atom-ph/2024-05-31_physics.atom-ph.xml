      <title>Rearrangement of single atoms in a 2000-site optical tweezers array at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the trapping of single rubidium atoms in large arrays of optical tweezers comprising up to 2088 sites in a cryogenic environment at 6 K. Our approach relies on the use of microscope objectives that are in-vacuum but at room temperature, in combination with windowless thermal shields into which the objectives are protruding to ensure a cryogenic environment for the trapped atoms. To achieve enough optical power for efficient trapping, we combine two lasers at slightly different wavelengths. We discuss the performance and limitations of our design. Finally, we demonstrate atom-by-atom rearrangement of an 828-atom target array using moving optical tweezers controlled by a field-programmable gate array.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Accuracy of the Variational Energy: Zeeman Effect in Hydrogen Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hydrogen atom subjected to a constant magnetic field, we report the first numerical realization of the two-dimensional Non-Linearization Procedure (NLP) to estimate the accuracy of the variational energy associated with a trial function. Relevant equations of the NLP, which resemble those describing a dielectric medium with a space-dependent permittivity, are solved numerically with high accuracy using an orthogonal collocation method. As an illustration, we consider the trial function proposed in del Valle et al., Phys. Rev. A 103, (2021) 032820, and establish the accuracy of the variational energy and the local accuracy of the trial function for a strength of the magnetic field $\gamma=1$ a.u. Additionally, we investigate the accuracy of the cusp parameter and quadrupole moment calculated by means of the trial function.</description>

      <title>A Python Program for Computation of Transition Probabilities, Oscillator Strengths for Li-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The available software to study the spectroscopic characteristics of atoms, ions, and molecules runs on a server, e.g., the general-purpose atomic structure package (GRASP) and R-matrix method. A Python program has been developed to compute Transition Probabilities, oscillator strengths, Line strengths, matrix elements, and radii of the orbit for lithium and its iso-electronic sequence. The program is straightforward, easily applicable without installation, and uses built-in Python libraries. It can be run on personal computers core I3 and above. The effective charge, effective quantum numbers, and energies of upper and lower levels serve as input parameters for computing the spectral quantities mentioned above. As a case study, we implemented our program on Li I, F VII, Na IX, Al XI, Mg X, and Fe XXIV to calculate transition probabilities, oscillator strengths, and line strengths. The results are compared and found to align with the corresponding values in the NIST data.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy Nuclear Spin Dependent Parity Violating Amplitudes in $^{133}$Cs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory at the singles and doubles approximation has been implemented to estimate nuclear spin dependent (NSD) parity violating (PV) electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes ($E1_{PV}^{NSD}$) among hyperfine levels of the $6s ~^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in $^{133}$Cs. To validate our calculations, we reproduce the Dirac-Hartree-Fock values and results from the combined coupled-Dirac-Hartree-Fock and random phase approximation (CPDF-RPA) method reported earlier. Contributions from the double-core-polarization (DCP) effects at the CPDF-RPA method were found to be between 3-12\% among different hyperfine levels. We derived a generalized expression for $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$, which helped incorporate both the NSD PV Hamiltonian and E1 operator simultaneously in the perturbative approach to account for the DCP contributions. The RCC method subsumes the CPDF-RPA and DCP effects in addition to contributions from the Br\"uckner pair-correlations and normalization of the wave functions, and correlations among them. To improve accuracy of the $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$ amplitudes further, we replace the {\it ab initio} values of the E1 matrix elements and energies by their experimental values via a sum-over-states approach.</description>

      <title>Chirp asymmetry in Zeeman electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest three-level system exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) exhibits an effective conjugation symmetry as well as a permutation symmetry. Breaking conjugation symmetry leads to a distinct chirp asymmetry; the differential response to a frequency increase versus a frequency decrease. Hanle-Zeeman EIT resonance is an ideal platform for testing the theory of chirp asymmetry because so many optical parameters of the system can be changed experimentally. We describe the theory and compare it to an experiment using 87Rb in a buffer gas cell. In contrast with earlier multi-photon chirp asymmetry work this present effort explores the asymmetry at nearly one billionth the earlier chirp rate, yet displays its universal features. Chirp asymmetry may have metrological consequences for understanding systematic dependence on modulation/demodulation parameters.</description>

      <title>Generic transverse stability of kink structures in atomic and optical nonlinear media with competing attractive and repulsive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence and stability of one-dimensional (1D) topological kink configurations immersed in higher-dimensional bosonic gases and nonlinear optical setups. Our analysis pertains, in particular, to the two- and three-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii models with quantum fluctuations describing droplet-bearing environments but also to the two-dimensional cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation containing higher-order corrections to the nonlinear refractive index. Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience. These generic (across different models) findings should be detectable in current cold atom and optics experiments. They also offer insights towards controlling topological excitations and their usage in topological quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Low-energy collisions between electrons and BeD$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multichannel quantum defect theory is applied in the treatment of the dissociative recombination and vibrational excitation processes for the BeD$^+$ ion in the twenty four vibrational levels of its ground electronic state ($\textrm{X}\,{^{1}\Sigma^{+}},v_{i}^{+}=0\ldots 23$). Three electronic symmetries of BeD$^{**}$ states (\ensuremath{^{2}\Pi}, \ensuremath{^{2}\Sigma^{+}}, and \ensuremath{^{2}\Delta}), are considered in the calculation of cross sections and the corresponding rate coefficients. The incident electron energy range is $10^{-5}$--2.7 eV and the electron temperature range is 100--5000~K. The vibrational dependence of these collisional processes is highlighted. The resulting data are useful in magnetic confinement fusion edge plasma modelling and spectroscopy, in devices with beryllium based main chamber materials, such as ITER and JET, and operating with the deuterium-tritium fuel mix. An extensive rate coefficients database is presented in graphical form and also by analytic fit functions whose parameters are tabulated in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Rydberg-dressed extended Bose Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition of different length scales in quantum many-body systems leads to various novel phenomena, including the emergence of correlated dynamics or non-local order. To access and investigate such effects in an itinerant lattice-based quantum simulator, it has been proposed to introduce tunable extended-range interactions using off-resonant optical coupling to Rydberg states. However, experimental realizations of such "Rydberg dressing" have so far mostly concentrated on spin systems without motion. Here, we overcome a number of experimental challenges limiting previous work and realize an effective one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM). Harnessing our quantum gas microscope, we probe the correlated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of extended-range repulsively-bound pairs at low filling, and kinetically-constrained "hard rods" at half filling. Near equilibrium, we observe density ordering when adiabatically turning on the extended-range interactions. Our results demonstrate the versatility of Rydberg dressing in engineering itinerant optical lattice-based quantum simulators and pave the way to realizing novel light-controlled extended-range interacting quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study of the dissociative recombination of SH$^+$ with electrons through the $^2\Pi$ states of SH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantitative theoretical study of the dissociative recombination of SH$^+$ with electrons has been carried out. Multireference, configuration interaction calculations were used to determine accurate potential energy curves for SH$^+$ and SH. The block diagonalization method was used to disentangle strongly interacting SH valence and Rydberg states and to construct a diabatic Hamiltonian whose diagonal matrix elements provide the diabatic potential energy curves. The off-diagonal elements are related to the electronic valence-Rydberg couplings. Cross sections and rate coefficients for the dissociative recombination reaction were calculated with a step-wise version of the multichannel quantum defect theory, using the molecular data provided by the block diagonalization method. The calculated rates are compared with the most recent measurements performed on the TSR ion storage ring in Heidelberg, Germany.</description>

      <title>Probing Electronic Motion and Core Potential by Coulomb-reshaped Terahertz Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of electronic motion and structural information of atoms and molecules is encoded into strong-field induced radiations ranging from terahertz (THz) to extreme ultraviolet wavelength. The dependence of THz yields in bi-chromatic laser fields on ellipticity and interpulse phase delay were experimentally measured, and the trajectory calculations establish the link between the THz emission and the motion of the photoelectron wave packet. The interaction between the photoelectron and parent core transforms from soft collision to recollision as the laser field tuned from elliptical to linear polarization, which can be reflected in THz emission. The soft collision is found to be more effective in reconstructing electron dynamics through THz polarization, which enables to construct the effective core potential of the generating medium with the Coulomb-reshaped THz radiation in an elliptically polarized laser field. Our work allows designing innovative all-optical THz measurements of electronic and structural dynamics.</description>
