      <title>InterFeat: An Automated Pipeline for Finding Interesting Hypotheses in Structured Biomedical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding interesting phenomena is the core of scientific discovery, but it is a manual, ill-defined concept. We present an integrative pipeline for automating the discovery of interesting simple hypotheses (feature-target relations with effect direction and a potential underlying mechanism) in structured biomedical data. The pipeline combines machine learning, knowledge graphs, literature search and Large Language Models. We formalize "interestingness" as a combination of novelty, utility and plausibility. On 8 major diseases from the UK Biobank, our pipeline consistently recovers risk factors years before their appearance in the literature. 40--53% of our top candidates were validated as interesting, compared to 0--7% for a SHAP-based baseline. Overall, 28% of 109 candidates were interesting to medical experts. The pipeline addresses the challenge of operationalizing "interestingness" scalably and for any target.

      <title>Physiological and Transcriptional Responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to Simulated Lunar and Martian Regolith Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of plant-based bioregenerative life support systems is a central objective in NASA's Moon to Mars strategy. Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism with extensive genomic resources, serves as a key species to investigate plant resilience in extraterrestrial environments. We assessed the physiological and gene expression responses of A. thaliana (Col-0) grown in two off-world regolith simulants: LHS-2 (lunar highlands) and MGS-1 (Martian global). Plants exposed to these substrates exhibited significant reductions in root elongation, biomass, and chlorophyll content, along with elevated anthocyanin levels and transcriptional upregulation of stress-related genes including IRT1, PCS1, SOD1, and JAZ1. Evidence of jasmonic acid pathway activation and auxin signaling suppression suggests metal-induced hormonal misregulation. Our integrated analysis of morphological traits, pigment accumulation, and transcriptomic profiles reveals distinct mineral-specific stress responses, offering critical insights into substrate engineering strategies for future space agriculture.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of control zone restrictions on pig placement in simulated African swine fever in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease that poses a significant threat to the swine industry, requiring stringent control measures, including movement restrictions that delay pig placements, impacting business continuity. The number and economic impact of unplaced healthy animals due to control zone restrictions remains unmeasured. This study evaluates the economic and epidemiological impacts of control zone placement restrictions during simulated ASF outbreaks in U.S. commercial swine farms. We model the spread of ASF and apply the U.S. National Response Plan (NRP) alongside alternative mitigation strategies, analyzing key metrics such as the number of unplaced pigs, depopulated pigs, infected farms, and total economic losses. Our findings estimate the median number of unplaced pigs in the first year was 153,020 (IQR 27,377 to 1,307,899) under the NRP scenario. Shorter control zone durations (20 to 25 days) effectively reduce the median number of unplaced pigs by 16.7% to 33.5%, whereas longer durations (40 days) increase unplacement numbers by 32%. The median number of depopulated pigs remains broadly consistent across all durations. Expanding the infected zone (5 to 15 km) increases the median number of unplaced pigs by 53.6% to 282% while reducing depopulated pigs by 28.8% to 73.9%, respectively. Economic losses are estimated through a model that includes depopulated and unplaced animals requiring culling. We examined the situations when 5%, 12%, or 20% of unplaced pigs required culling and found that the total cost ranged from zero (no second infection) to over $800 million.</description>

      <title>Compositional amortized inference for large-scale hierarchical Bayesian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) has emerged as a powerful simulation-based approach for estimating complex mechanistic models, offering fast posterior sampling via generative neural networks. However, extending ABI to hierarchical models, a cornerstone of modern Bayesian analysis, remains a major challenge due to the difficulty of scaling to large numbers of parameters. In this work, we build on compositional score matching (CSM), a divide-and-conquer strategy for Bayesian updating using diffusion models. To address existing stability issues of CSM, we propose adaptive solvers coupled with a novel, error-damping compositional estimator. Our proposed method remains stable even with hundreds of thousands of data points and parameters. We validate our approach on a controlled toy example, a high-dimensional spatial autoregressive model, and a real-world advanced microscopy biological application task involving over 750,000 parameters.</description>

      <title>ReBaCCA-ss: Relevance-Balanced Continuum Correlation Analysis with Smoothing and Surrogating for Quantifying Similarity Between Population Spiking Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying similarity between population spike patterns is essential for understanding how neural dynamics encode information. Traditional approaches, which combine kernel smoothing, PCA, and CCA, have limitations: smoothing kernel bandwidths are often empirically chosen, CCA maximizes alignment between patterns without considering the variance explained within patterns, and baseline correlations from stochastic spiking are rarely corrected. We introduce ReBaCCA-ss (Relevance-Balanced Continuum Correlation Analysis with smoothing and surrogating), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) balancing alignment and variance explanation via continuum canonical correlation; (2) correcting for noise using surrogate spike trains; and (3) selecting the optimal kernel bandwidth by maximizing the difference between true and surrogate correlations. ReBaCCA-ss is validated on both simulated data and hippocampal recordings from rats performing a Delayed Nonmatch-to-Sample task. It reliably identifies spatio-temporal similarities between spike patterns. Combined with Multidimensional Scaling, ReBaCCA-ss reveals structured neural representations across trials, events, sessions, and animals, offering a powerful tool for neural population analysis.</description>

      <title>Virtual Cells: Predict, Explain, Discover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development. Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug discovery outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biodiversity research requires complete and detailed information to study ecosystem dynamics at different scales. Employing data-driven methods like Machine Learning is getting traction in ecology and more specific biodiversity, offering alternative modelling pathways. For these methods to deliver accurate results there is the need for large, curated and multimodal datasets that offer granular spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, we introduce BioCube, a multimodal, fine-grained global dataset for ecology and biodiversity research. BioCube incorporates species observations through images, audio recordings and descriptions, environmental DNA, vegetation indices, agricultural, forest, land indicators, and high-resolution climate variables. All observations are geospatially aligned under the WGS84 geodetic system, spanning from 2000 to 2020. The dataset will become available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BioDT/BioCube while the acquisition and processing code base at https://github.com/BioDT/bfm-data.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Characterization of these often-complicated behaviors remains challenging. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. We additionally show that the same strategy can be used to characterize the stochastic motion of bacteria, establishing that this approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool or as a component of a broader data-driven analysis framework for dynamical data.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, \emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description>
