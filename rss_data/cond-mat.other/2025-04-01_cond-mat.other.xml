      <title>Magnetic Confinement of a Bubble of Supercooled $^3$He-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have designed and constructed a magnet surrounding a cylindrical volume of superfluid helium-3 to isolate a region of metastable, supercooled A-phase, entirely surrounded by bulk A-phase - isolating the 'bubble' from rough surfaces that can trigger the transition to the stable B-phase. We outline the design of the experimental cell and magnet, and show that the performance of the magnet is consistent with simulations, including the capability to producing the high field gradient required for generating a bubble. Future plans include the investigation of possible intrinsic mechanisms underpinning the A-B transition, with potential implications for early-universe cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Effective Description of Ajar Systems with a $U(1)$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</description>

      <title>Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic, acoustic, and water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waves of various types carry momentum, which is associated with their propagation direction, i.e., the phase gradient. The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry and magnetism in a 3D Kagome lattice: RPt$_2$B (R = La and Nd) prototype crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality in crystals arises from the exclusive presence of proper symmetry operations, such as rotations and screw axes, while lacking improper operations like inversion, mirror planes, and roto-inversions. Crystallographic chirality is expected to be coupled with magnetic responses in magnetically active chiral compounds. Therefore, this study investigates the interplay between structural chirality and magnetic ordering in the rare-earth platinum boride family, RPt$_2$B, where R denotes lanthanide elements. Our results show that the R sites structurally form a chiral three-dimensional Kagome lattice, which can lead to magnetic frustration resolved through chiral antiferromagnetic orderings in conjunction with chiral symmetry. Symmetry analysis reveals that these chiral antiferromagnetic states are low-energy states, competing with higher-in-energy (001) ferromagnetic configuration. We also identified Kramers-type Weyl points in the electronic structure without magnetic response. In the magnetically active chiral compound NdPt$_2$B, Zeeman splitting lifts degeneracies at the high-symmetry points; however, Weyl points persist due to the breaking of time-reversal (T) and inversion (P) symmetries. We also estimate the anomalous Hall conductivity, a measurable observable of the allowed topological features finding a value of $\sigma_{xy} = 293$ S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ comparable with another Kagome magnetic materials like Mn$_3$PtN and FeSn, for example. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among chirality, magnetism, and topology in rare-earth Kagome materials.</description>

      <title>He-Mg compounds and helium-driven nonmetal transition in metallic magnesium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polymorphism and mechanism of helium compounds is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical nature of He-bearing materials under pressures. Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Enhances Self-Healing for Non-Hermitian Topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and analyzes a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model generalized through spin-dependent non-Abelian SU(2) gauge couplings. By incorporating SU(2) symmetry transformations that couple explicitly to spin degrees of freedom, our model demonstrates distinct topological properties originating from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and gauge-induced spin-orbit coupling. Exact diagonalization and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) analyses reveal distinct spectral phases, characterized by complex-energy loops under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and substantial localization indicative of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundary conditions (OBC). We define a gauge-invariant winding number for non-Hermitian chiral symmetry, clarifying the topological transitions. Furthermore, we uncover a novel self-healing phenomenon in response to dynamically introduced scattering potentials, showing significant robustness enhancement induced by appropriate non-Abelian SU(2) couplings. These findings clarify how non-Abelian gauge interactions can control spin-dependent localization and dynamical stability in non-Hermitian topological systems, guiding the development of tunable quantum devices.</description>
