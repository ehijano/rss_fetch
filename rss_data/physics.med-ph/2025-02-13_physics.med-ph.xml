      <title>Impact of Electric Spatially Discordant Alternans on Cardiac Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially discordant alternans (SDA) play a crucial role in cardiac arrhythmogenesis by creating steep repolarization gradients facilitating conduction block and reentry. While traditionally studied using electrical indicators, this work provides a novel perspective by characterizing SDA through their magnetic field signatures. Using a one-dimensional cardiac fiber model, we demonstrate that magnetic field measurements effectively detect SDA and temperature dependent changes in cardiac action potentials, offering a non-invasive alternative to conventional electrophysiological metrics. Our results reveal that the spatial organization of SDA is mirrored in the magnetic field distribution, with SDA nodes clearly identifiable via spatial mapping. Notably, magnetic restitution curves exhibit a distinct pattern from APD-based indicators, closely following the dynamics of the action potential upstroke. These findings establish the cardiac magnetic field as a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting SDA, opening new avenues for biomagnetic monitoring of arrhythmic risk.</description>

      <title>A diffusion MRI model for random walks confined on cylindrical surfaces: Towards non-invasive quantification of myelin sheath radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the myelin sheath radius of myelinated axons in vivo is important for understanding, diagnosing, and monitoring various neurological disorders. Despite advancements in diffusion MRI (dMRI) microstructure techniques, there are currently no models specifically designed to estimate myelin sheath radii. This proof-of-concept theoretical study presents two novel dMRI models that characterize the signal from water diffusion confined to cylindrical surfaces, approximating myelin water diffusion. We derive their spherical mean signals, eliminating fiber orientation and dispersion effects for convenience. These models are further extended to account for multiple concentric cylinders, mimicking the layered structure of myelin. Additionally, we introduce a method to convert histological distributions of axonal inner radii from the literature into myelin sheath radius distributions. We also derive analytical expressions to estimate the effective myelin sheath radius expected from these distributions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations conducted in cylindrical and spiral geometries validate the models. These simulations demonstrate agreement with analytical predictions. Furthermore, we observe significant correlations between the effective radii derived from histological distributions and those obtained by fitting the dMRI signal to a single-cylinder model. These models may be integrated with existing multi-compartment dMRI techniques, opening the door to non-invasive in vivo assessments of myelin sheath radii. Such assessments would require MRI scanners equipped with strong diffusion gradients, allowing measurements with short echo times. Further work is required to validate the technique with real dMRI data and histological measurements.</description>
