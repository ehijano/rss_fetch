      <title>Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Trajectory Design Under Operational Uncertainties for DESTINY+ Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.</description>

      <title>COSMIC's Large-Scale Search for Technosignatures during the VLA sky Survey: Survey Description and First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing algorithms to search through data efficiently is a challenging part of searching for signs of technology beyond our solar system. We have built a digital signal processing system and computer cluster on the backend of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico in order to search for signals throughout the Galaxy consistent with our understanding of artificial radio emissions. In our first paper, we described the system design and software pipelines. In this paper, we describe a postprocessing pipeline to identify persistent sources of interference, filter out false positives, and search for signals not immediately identifiable as anthropogenic radio frequency interference during the VLA Sky Survey. As of 01 September 2024, the Commensal Open-source Multi-mode Interferometric Cluster had observed more than 950,000 unique pointings. This paper presents the strategy we employ when commensally observing during the VLA Sky Survey and a postprocessing strategy for the data collected during the survey. To test this postprocessing pipeline, we searched toward 511 stars from the $Gaia$ catalog with coherent beams. This represents about 30 minutes of observation during VLASS, where we typically observe about 2000 sources per hour in the coherent beamforming mode. We did not detect any unidentifiable signals, setting isotropic power limits ranging from 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{16}$W.</description>

      <title>Fractal algorithm for multiple lens analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microlensing exoplanet search is a unique method for finding planets orbiting distant stars. However, in the past, the method used to analyze microlensing data could not deal with complex lens systems. The number of lenses was limited three or less. Positions calculations of images and integration of them suffered from severe round-off errors because of singularities. We developed a new algorithm to calculate the light curves of multiple lens systems. In this algorithm, fractal-like consecutive self-similar division (SSD) is used to find sparse images. SSD is also useful for integrating images to efficiently obtain magnifications. The new algorithm does not use root finding for the lens equation and is free from caustic singularities. There is no limit on the number of lenses. Compared to inverse-ray shooting, this method dramatically improves the computing time. The calculation can be adjusted to obtain either a high-precision final result or high-speed quick result. Although this new algorithm was developed for a microlensing planet search, its application to quasar microlensing is also expected. This paper discusses problems in the modeling of a multiple lens system and then presents the new algorithm in detail.</description>

      <title>TRIPP: A General Purpose Data Pipeline for Astronomical Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the TRansient Image Processing Pipeline (TRIPP), a transient and variable source detection pipeline that employs both difference imaging and light curve analysis techniques for astronomical data. Additionally, we demonstrate TRIPP's rapid analysis capability by detecting transient candidates in near-real time. TRIPP was tested using image data of the supernova SN2023ixf and from the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS) collected by the Las Cumbres Observatory's (LCO) network of 0.4 m telescopes. To verify the methods employed by TRIPP, we compare our results to published findings on the photometry of SN2023ixf. Additionally, we report the ability of TRIPP to detect transient signals from optical Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) sources.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination of N$_2$H$^+$: Isotopic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of the isotopic ratio of interstellar nitrogen -- $^{14}$N versus $^{15}$N -- is done, for explaining its variations observed for N2H+ in different interstellar and Solar environments. The goal is to produce cross sections and rate coefficients for electron impact dissociative recombination for different isotopologues of N$_2$H$^+$, since it was envisioned as a novel source that can lead to nitrogen fractionation. We calculate dissociative recombination cross sections and rate coefficients using the normal mode approximation combined with the R-matrix theory and vibronic frame transformation within the multichannel quantum defect theory for eight isotopologues containing both $^{14}$N, $^{15}$N and H, D. Our calculations show that the relative differences respective to the main isotopologue ($^{14}$N$_2$H$^+$) is below 1% for the hydrogen containing isotopologues, but reaches almost 30% for the heaviest deuterated isotopologue, leading us to the conclusion that according to the present status of the theory, dissociative recombination is not responsible for the peculiar $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratios of N$_2$H$^+$ observed in the different interstellar molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Pseudo-power spectrum formalism, improved source masking and validation on mocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise, unbiased measurements of extragalactic background anisotropies require careful treatment of systematic effects in fluctuation-based, broad-band intensity mapping measurements. In this paper we detail improvements in methodology for the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER), concentrating on flat field errors and source masking errors. In order to bypass the use of field differences, which mitigate flat field errors but reduce sensitivity, we characterize and correct for the flat field on pseudo-power spectra, which includes both additive and multiplicative biases. To more effectively mask point sources at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m, we develop a technique for predicting masking catalogs that utilizes optical and NIR photometry through random forest regression. This allows us to mask over two Vega magnitudes deeper than the completeness limits of 2MASS alone, with errors in the shot noise power remaining below $&lt;10\%$ at all masking depths considered. Through detailed simulations of CIBER observations, we validate our formalism and demonstrate unbiased recovery of the sky fluctuations on realistic mocks. We demonstrate that residual flat field errors comprise $&lt;20\%$ of the final CIBER power spectrum uncertainty with this methodology.</description>

      <title>Significant increase in sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search upon including higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most gravitational wave searches to date have included only the quadrupole mode in their search templates. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating higher harmonics improves the search sensitive volume for detecting binary black hole mergers, challenging the conclusion of previous studies. Using the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ detection pipeline, and the simulated (injection) signals from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration, we quantify the improvement in sensitivity due to the inclusion of higher harmonics. This improvement is significant for systems with higher mass ratios and larger total masses, with gains in sensitivity even exceeding $100\%$ at certain high masses. We also show that, due to using a marginalized detection statistic, the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline performs roughly as well as its quadrupole-mode-only counterpart even for equal mass-ratio mergers, and its sensitive volume is either better than or comparable to that of the individual LVK pipelines.</description>

      <title>There is Room at the Top: Fundamental Quantum Limits for Detecting Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sky of astrophysical gravitational waves is expected to be quiet above $\sim 10{\rm kHz}$, which is the upper limit of characteristic frequencies of dynamical processes involving astrophysical black holes and neutron stars. Therefore, the ultrahigh ($\ge 10{\rm kHz}$) frequency window is particularly promising for detecting primordial gravitational waves, as isolating the contribution from the astrophysical foreground has always been a challenging problem for gravitational wave background detection at ${\rm nHz, mHz}$ and the audio band studied so far. While there are various types of detectors proposed targeting the ultra-high frequency gravitational waves, they have to satisfy the (loss-constrained) fundamental limits of quantum measurements. We develop a universal framework for the quantum limit under different measurement schemes and input quantum states, and apply them to several plausible detector configurations. The fundamental limits are expressed as the strength of gravitational wave background at different frequencies, which should serve as a lower limit for ultra-high frequency gravitational wave signal possibly detectable, to probe early-universe phase transitions, and/or other primordial gravitational wave sources. We discover that a GUT-motivated phase transition from $10^7-10^{10}\,\rm{GeV}$ can naturally lead to possibly detectable GW signals within the band of $\rm{kHz-MHz}$. For phase transition above $10^{10}\,\rm{GeV}$, the signals are however below the quantum limit and are thus not detectable. Ultra-high frequency GWs also provide a window to test topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings generated close to the GUT scale.</description>

      <title>Squeezing at the normal-mode splitting frequency of a nonlinear coupled cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled optical cavities, which support normal modes, play a critical role in optical filtering, sensing, slow-light generation, and quantum state manipulation. Recent theoretical work has proposed incorporating nonlinear materials into these systems to enable novel quantum technologies. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of squeezing generated in a quantum-enhanced coupled-cavity system, achieving a quantum noise reduction of 3.5 dB at a normal-mode splitting frequency of 7.47 MHz. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's loss mechanisms and performance limitations, validating theoretical predictions. Our results underscore the promise of coupled-cavity squeezers for advanced quantum applications, including gravitational wave detection and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches" that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms. We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</description>

      <title>New binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3b data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of 6 new candidate binary black hole (BBH) merger signals in the publicly released data from the second half of the third observing run (O3b) of advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration reported 35 compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in their analysis of the O3b data [1], with 30 BBH mergers having coincidence in the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We confirm 17 of these for a total of 23 detections in our analysis of the Hanford-Livingston coincident O3b data. We identify candidates using a search pipeline employing aligned-spin quadrupole-only waveforms. Our pipeline is similar to the one used in our O3a coincident analysis [2], except for a few improvements in the veto procedure and the ranking statistic, and we continue to use an astrophysical probability of one half as our detection threshold, following the approach of the LVK catalogs. Most of the new candidates reported in this work are placed in the upper and lower-mass gap of the black hole (BH) mass distribution. We also identify a possible neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger. We expect these events to help inform the black hole mass and spin distributions inferred in a full population analysis.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. MARFA employs an eleven-grid interpolation technique, enabling accurate and efficient computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel machine learning (ML) method to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding techniques are computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\infty $ errors of $ 4.54 \times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the NNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with mixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to traditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT engine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than a traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of 1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the Delta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for TensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8 million data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with increasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed, enabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work underscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model quantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations.</description>
