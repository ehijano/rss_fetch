      <title>Failure of the measure contraction property via quotients in higher-step sub-Riemannian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) for sub-Riemannian structures beyond step two. We show that whenever the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, the MCP may fail. This occurs already in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.
  Central to our analysis are new results on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.
  Since the MCP is preserved under blow-ups, we focus on Carnot homogeneous spaces, proving that MCP descends to suitable quotients. As a byproduct, any structure whose tangent at some point admits a quotient to Martinet fails the MCP. We also obtain a computation-free proof that the Grushin plane shares the Heisenberg group's MCP. Applications include a detailed analysis of validity and failure of the MCP for Carnot groups of low dimension.
  Our results suggest a conjecture on the failure of the MCP in presence of Goh abnormal geodesics satisfying the strong generalized Legendre condition.</description>

      <title>Cosymplectic Chern--Hamilton conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Chern-Hamilton energy functional on compact cosymplectic manifolds, fully classifying in dimension 3 those manifolds admitting a critical compatible metric for this functional. This is the case if and only if either the manifold is co-K\"ahler or if it is a mapping torus of the 2-torus by a hyperbolic toral automorphism and equipped with a suspension cosymplectic structure. Moreover, any critical metric has minimal energy among all compatible metrics. We also exhibit examples of manifolds with first Betti number $b_1 \geq 2$ admitting cosymplectic structures, but such that no cosymplectic structure admits a critical compatible metric.</description>

      <title>Stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new definition of stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces from variational perspective for any $1\leq r\leq n-1$. More precisely, we define stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces to be smooth local minimizers of a new energy functional under volume-preserving and contact angle-preserving variations. Using the new concept of the stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces, we generalize the stability results of Souam \cite{Souam} in a Euclidean half-space and Guo-Wang-Xia \cite{GWX} in a horoball in hyperbolic space for capillary hypersurface to $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurface case.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of extremal Sasaki metrics via the Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose rule from classical mirror symmetry in the context of Sasakian geometry and results on relative K-stability in the Sasaki setting developed by Boyer and van Coevering to exhibit examples of Sasaki manifolds of big Sasaki cones that do not admit any extremal Sasaki metrics at all. Previously, examples with this feature were produced by Boyer and van Coevering for Brieskorn-Pham polynomials or their deformations. Our examples are based on the more general framework of invertible polynomials. In particular, we construct families of links that preserve the emptiness of the extremal Sasaki-Reeb cone via the Berglund-H\"ubsch rule: if the link does not admit extremal Sasaki metrics then its Berglund-H\"ubsch dual preserves this property and moreover this dual admits a representative in its local moduli with a larger Sasaki-Reeb cone which remains obstructed to admitting extremal Sasaki metrics. Some of the examples exhibited here have the homotopy type of a sphere or are rational homology spheres.</description>

      <title>Helicoidal surfaces of frontals in Euclidian space as deformations of surfaces of revolution, with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate helicoidal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space whose profile curves are frontals. Using the framework of Legendre curves and framed surfaces, we establish conditions under which helicoidal surfaces generated by frontals are themselves frontals or fronts. We then derive curvature expressions in terms of the invariants of the generating Legendre curve. Our study extends classical results on parallel and focal surfaces of surfaces of revolution to the helicoidal setting. In particular, we show that both parallel and focal surfaces of a helicoidal surface are helicoidal, with their generating curves arising from one-parameter deformations of the corresponding parallel and evolute curves. We prove that singularities of these curves persist under such deformations, revealing geometric rigidity and stability of singularities. Finally, we examine the behavior of the Gaussian and mean curvatures near singular points of helicoidal surfaces</description>

      <title>Huber Theorem revisited in dimensions 2 and 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the second Huber Theorem in dimensions 2 and 4. In dimension 2, we prove the optimal regularity for the conformal factor using Coulomb frames. In dimension $4$, given a metric having a pointwise singularity with $L^p$-bounds on the Bach tensor, we construct a conformal metric which is regular across the singularity. To do so, we introduce another Coulomb-type condition, similar to the case of Yang--Mills connections. This enables us to obtain a conformal metric satisfying an $\varepsilon$-regularity property. We obtain a generalization of the two-dimensional case that can be applied to study the singularities of Bach-flat metrics and immersions with second fundamental forms in $W^{2,\frac{4}{3}+\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>A Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu -type characterization for Sobolev differential forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a result by Bourgain, Brezis, and Mironescu characterizes when a function $f \in L^p(\Omega)$ is in the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ based on the limiting behavior of its Besov seminorms. We prove a direct analogue of this result which characterizes when a differential $k$-form $\omega \in L^p(\wedge^k T^* \Omega)$ has a weak exterior derivative $d\omega \in L^p(\wedge^{k+1} T^* \Omega)$, where the analogue of the Besov seminorm that our result uses is based on integration over simplices.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an area minimizing integral $m$-current $T$ within a submanifold $\Sigma$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$, taking a boundary $\Gamma$ with arbitrary multiplicity $Q \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, where $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are $C^{3, \kappa}$. We prove a sharp generalization of Allard's boundary regularity theorem to a higher multiplicity setting. Precisely, we prove that the set of density $Q/2$ singular boundary points of $T$ is $\mathcal{H}^{m-3}$-rectifiable. As a consequence, we show that the entire boundary regular set, without any assumptions on the density, is open and dense in $\Gamma$ which is also dimensionally sharp. Moreover, we prove that if $p \in \Gamma$ admits an open neighborhood in $\Gamma$ consisting of density $Q/2$ points with a tangent cone supported in a half $m$-plane, then $p$ is regular.
  Furthermore, we show that if the convex barrier condition is satisfied-namely, if $\Gamma$ is a closed manifold that lies at the boundary of a uniformly convex set and $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^{m+n}$-then the entire boundary singular set is $\mathcal{H}^{m-3}$-rectifiable. Additionally, we investigate certain assumptions on $\Gamma$ that enable us to provide further information about the singular boundary set.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>
