      <description>arXiv:2406.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two identities one pertaining to the state space of Poisson Point Processes (PPPs), and the other for the Voronoi tessellations formed by PPPs. Then, we explore several applications of these identities within the context of wireless cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic calculus for the theta process. The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums.</description>

      <title>Weak Universality in Random Persistent Homology and Scale-Invariant Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a universality result for the limiting distribution of persistence diagrams arising from geometric filtrations over random point processes. Specifically, we consider the distribution of the ratio of persistence values (death/birth), and show that for fixed dimension, homological degree and filtration type (Cech or Vietoris-Rips), the limiting distribution is independent of the underlying point process distribution, i.e., universal. In proving this result, we present a novel general framework for proving universality for scale-invariant functionals on point processes. Finally, we also provide a number of new results related to Morse theory in random geometric complexes, which may be of an independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the deterministic multidimensional Skorokhod problem with normal reflection in a family of time-dependent convex domains that are c\`adl\`ag with respect to the Hausdorff metric. We then show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to multidimensional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations reflected in these time-dependent domains. Additionally, we derive stability properties with respect to the initial condition and the coefficients. Finally, we establish a propagation of chaos result.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Elo Rating Systems via Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of the Elo rating system, a popular method for ranking skills of players in an online setting. In particular, we study Elo under the Bradley--Terry--Luce model and, using techniques from Markov chain theory, show that Elo learns the model parameters at a rate competitive with the state of the art. We apply our results to the problem of efficient tournament design and discuss a connection with the fastest-mixing Markov chain problem.</description>

      <title>Computing the Yaglom limit of Markov chains with a single exit state using their excursion measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove in this article the existence of the Yaglom limit for Markov chains on discrete state spaces in the setting where the absorbing state is accessible from a single non-absorbing state. We use a representation of the trajectories of this process by its excursion away from death, that allows us to link the Yaglom limit with the large deviations behaviour of the inverse of its local time at the exit state, and to compute its minimal quasi-stationary distribution with its excursion measure.</description>

      <title>On antiferromagnetic regimes in the Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ashkin-Teller model can be represented by a pair of Ising spin configurations with coupling constants $J$ and $J'$ for each, and $U$ for their product. We study this representation on the square lattice and confirm the presence of a mixed antiferromagnetic phase in the isotropic case ($J=J'$) when $-U&gt;0$ is sufficiently large and $J=J'&gt;0$ is sufficiently small, by means of a graphical representation. We then construct a coupling with the eight-vertex model and show that, in analogy to the first result, the corresponding height function is localised, although with antiferromagnetically ordered heights on one class of the graph.
  Using the OSSS inequality, we proceed to establish a subcritical sharpness statement along suitable curves in the anisotropic ($J\neq J'$) phase diagram when $U&lt;0$, circumventing the difficulty of the lack of general monotonicity properties in the parameters. We then address the isotropic case and provide indications of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>The number of connected components in sub-critical random graph processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the evolution of the number of connected components in sub-critical multiplicative random graph processes. We consider a model where edges appear independently after an exponential time at rate equal to the product of the sizes of the vertices. We provide an explicit expression for the fluid limit of the number of connected components normalized by its initial value, when the time is smaller than the inverse of the sum of the square of the initial vertex sizes. We also identify the diffusion limit of the rescaled fluctuations around the fluid limit. This is applied to several examples. In the particular setting of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process, we explicit the fluid limit of the number of connected components normalized, and the diffusion limit of the scaled fluctuations in the sub-critical regime, where the mean degree is between zero and one.</description>

      <title>It\^o's Formula for the Rearranged Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to prove a convenient version of It\^o's formula for the Rearranged Stochastic Heat Equation (RSHE) introduced by the two authors in a previous contribution. This equation is a penalised version of the standard Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE) on the circle subject to a coloured noise, whose solution is constrained to stay within the set of symmetric quantile functions by means of a reflection term. Here, we identity the generator of the solution when it is acting on functions defined on the space ${\mathcal P}_2({\mathbb R})$ (of one-dimensional probability measures with a finite second moment) that are assumed to be smooth in Lions' sense. In particular, we prove that the reflection term in the RSHE is orthogonal to the Lions (or Wasserstein) derivative of smooth functions defined on ${\mathcal P}_2({\mathbb R})$. The proof relies on non-trivial bounds for the gradient of the solution to the RSHE.</description>

      <title>Viscous shock fluctuations in KPZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ``V-shaped'' solutions to the KPZ equation, those having opposite asymptotic slopes $\theta$ and $-\theta$, with $\theta&gt;0$, at positive and negative infinity, respectively. Answering a question of Janjigian, Rassoul-Agha, and Sepp\"al\"ainen, we show that the spatial increments of V-shaped solutions cannot be statistically stationary in time. This completes the classification of statistically time-stationary spatial increments for the KPZ equation by ruling out the last case left by those authors.
  To show that these V-shaped time-stationary measures do not exist, we study the location of the corresponding ``viscous shock,'' which, roughly speaking, is the location of the bottom of the V. We describe the limiting rescaled fluctuations, and in particular show that the fluctuations of the shock location are not tight, for both stationary and flat initial data. We also show that if the KPZ equation is started with V-shaped initial data, then the long-time limits of the time-averaged laws of the spatial increments of the solution are mixtures of the laws of the spatial increments of $x\mapsto B(x)+\theta x$ and $x\mapsto B(x)-\theta x$, where $B$ is a standard two-sided Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop an intrinsic formalism to study the topology, smooth structure, and Riemannian geometry of the Wasserstein space of a closed Riemannian manifold. Our formalism allows for a new characterisation of the Weak topology via convergent sequences of the subjacent space. Applying it we also provide a new proof that Wasserstein spaces of closed manifolds are geodesically convex. Our framework is particularly handy to address the Wasserstein spaces of compact Lie groups, where we refine our formalism and present an explicit example.</description>

      <title>A Berry-Esseen theorem for incomplete U-statistics with Bernoulli sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a resurgence of interest in the asymptotic normality of incomplete U-statistics that only sum over roughly as many kernel evaluations as there are data samples, due to its computational efficiency and usefulness in quantifying the uncertainty for ensemble-based predictions. In this paper, we focus on the normal convergence of one such construction, the incomplete U-statistic with Bernoulli sampling, based on a raw sample of size $n$ and a computational budget $N$ in the same order as $n$. Under a minimalistic third moment assumption on the kernel, we offer an accompanying Berry-Esseen bound of the natural rate $1/\sqrt{\min(N, n)}$ that characterizes the normal approximating accuracy involved. Our key techniques include Stein's method specialized for the so-called Studentized nonlinear statistics, and an exponential lower tail bound for non-negative kernel U-statistics.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for lattice point counting on tessellated domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the approach of Bj$\ddot{\text{o}}$rklund and Gorodnik, we have considered the discrepancy function for lattice point counting on domains that can be nicely tessellated by the action of a diagonal semigroup. We have shown that suitably normalized discrepancy functions for lattice point counting on certain tessellated domains satisfy a non-degenerate central limit theorem. Furthermore, we have also addressed the same problem for affine and congruence lattice point counting, proving analogous non-degenerate central limit theorems for them. The main ingredients of the proofs are the method of cumulants and quantitative multiple mixing estimates.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Bernoulli Convolutions in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{d})=\lambda\in(0,1)^{d}$ with $\lambda_{1}&gt;...&gt;\lambda_{d}$, denote by $\mu_{\lambda}$ the Bernoulli convolution associated to $\lambda$. That is, $\mu_{\lambda}$ is the distribution of the random vector $\sum_{n\ge0}\pm\left(\lambda_{1}^{n},...,\lambda_{d}^{n}\right)$, where the $\pm$ signs are chosen independently and with equal weight. Assuming for each $1\le j\le d$ that $\lambda_{j}$ is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients $\pm1,0$, we prove that the dimension of $\mu_{\lambda}$ equals $\min\left\{ \dim_{L}\mu_{\lambda},d\right\} $, where $\dim_{L}\mu_{\lambda}$ is the Lyapunov dimension. More generally, we obtain this result in the context of homogeneous diagonal self-affine systems on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with rational translations.
  The proof extends to higher dimensions the works of Breuillard and Varj\'u and Varj\'u regarding Bernoulli convolutions on the real line. The main novelty and contribution of the present work lies in an extension of an entropy increase result, due to Varj\'u, in which the amount of increase in entropy is given explicitly. The extension of this result to the higher-dimensional non-conformal case requires significant new ideas.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the limiting distribution of special {\it additive functionals} on random planar maps, namely the number of occurrences of a given {\it pattern}. The main result is a central limit theorem for these pattern counts in the case of pattern with a simple boundary. The proof relies on a combination of analytic and combinatorial methods together with a moment method due to Gao and Wormald~\cite{GaoWormald}. It is an important issue to handle the overlap structure of two pattern which is the main difficulty in the proof.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Version of Chung's Lemma and its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chung's lemma is a classical tool for establishing asymptotic convergence rates of (stochastic) optimization methods under strong convexity-type assumptions and appropriate polynomial diminishing step sizes. In this work, we develop a generalized version of Chung's lemma, which provides a simple non-asymptotic convergence framework for a more general family of step size rules. We demonstrate broad applicability of the proposed generalized Chung's lemma by deriving tight non-asymptotic convergence rates for a large variety of stochastic methods. In particular, we obtain partially new non-asymptotic complexity results for stochastic optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent and random reshuffling, under a general $(\theta,\mu)$-Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition and for various step sizes strategies, including polynomial, constant, exponential, and cosine step sizes rules. Notably, as a by-product of our analysis, we observe that exponential step sizes can adapt to the objective function's geometry, achieving the optimal convergence rate without requiring exact knowledge of the underlying landscape. Our results demonstrate that the developed variant of Chung's lemma offers a versatile, systematic, and streamlined approach to establish non-asymptotic convergence rates under general step size rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuation of the macroscopic market making \`a la Avellaneda-Stoikov as a control problem, this paper explores its stochastic game. Concerning the price competition, each agent is compared with the best quote from the others. We start with the linear case. While constructing the solution directly, the ordering property and the dimension reduction in the equilibrium are revealed. For the non-linear case, extending the decoupling approach, we introduce a multidimensional characteristic equation to study the well-posedness of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Properties of coefficients in the characteristic equation are obtained via non-smooth analysis. In addition to novel well-posedness results, the linear price impact arises and the impact function can be further decomposed into two parts in some examples.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Moment Method for Regular Graphs I: Kesten-McKay and Semicircle distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the Chebyshev moment method to study the spectrum of regular graphs, motivated by the work of Serr\'e. By this method, we give an elementary proof of the weak convergence to the Kesten-McKay distribution for the normalized spectral measures of random $N$-lifts in probability as $N$ tends to infinity. For a sequence of random $(q_n+1)$-regular graphs $G_n$ with $n$ vertices, we show that if $q_n=n^{o(1)}$ and $q_n$ tends to infinity, then the normalized spectral measure converges in Wasserstein $p$-distance $W_{p}$ to the semicircle distribution for any $p \in [1,\infty)$ almost surely. This strengthens the result of Dumitriu and Pal.</description>

      <title>Stochastic ordering of series and parallel systems lifetime in Archimedean copula under random shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we studied the stochastic ordering behavior of series as well as parallel systems lifetimes comprising dependent and heterogeneous components, experiencing random shocks, and exhibiting distinct dependency structures. We establish certain conditions for the lifetime of individual components, the dependency among components defined by Archimedean copulas, and the impact of random shocks on the overall system lifetime to reach the conclusion. We consider components whose survival functions are either increasing log-concave or decreasing log-convex functions of the parameters involved and systems exhibit different dependency structures. These conditions make it possible to compare the lifetimes of two systems using the usual stochastic order framework. Additionally, we provide examples and graphical representations to elucidate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Large population limit of interacting population dynamics via generalized gradient structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on the derivation of a doubly nonlocal Fisher-KPP model, which is a macroscopic nonlocal evolution equation describing population dynamics in the large population limit. The derivation starts from a microscopic individual-based model described as a stochastic process on the space of atomic measures with jump rates that satisfy detailed balance w.r.t. to a reference measure. We make use of the so-called `cosh' generalized gradient structure for the law of the process to pass to the large population limit using evolutionary Gamma-convergence. In addition to characterizing the large population limit as the solution of the nonlocal Fisher-KPP model, our variational approach further provides a generalized gradient flow structure for the limit equation as well as an entropic propagation of chaos result.</description>

      <title>A model for slowing particles in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple model in dimension $d\geq 2$ for slowing particles in random media, where point particles move in straight lines among and inside spherical identical obstacles with Poisson distributed centres. When crossing an obstacle, a particle is slowed down according to the law $\dot{V}= -\frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} S(|V|) V$, where $V$ is the velocity of the point particle, $\kappa$ is a positive constant, $\epsilon$ is the radius of the obstacle and $S(|V|)$ is a given slowing profile. With this choice, the slowing rate in the obstacles is such that the variation of speed at each crossing is of order $1$. We study the asymptotic limit of the particle system when $\epsilon$ vanishes and the mean free path of the point particles stays finite. We prove the convergence of the point particles density measure to the solution of a kinetic-like equation with a collision term which includes a contribution proportional to a $\delta$ function in $v=0$; this contribution guarantees the conservation of mass for the limit equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a hierarchical model of non-overlapping cubes of sidelengths $2^j$, $j \in \mathbb{Z}$. The model allows for cubes of arbitrarily small size and the activities need not be translationally invariant. It can also be recast as a spin system on a tree with long-range hard-core interaction. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Gibbs measures, discuss fragmentation and condensation, and prove bounds on the decay of two-point correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $B$-tree is a type of search tree where every node (except possibly for the root) contains between $m$ and $2m$ keys for some positive integer $m$, and all leaves have the same distance to the root. We study sequences of $B$-trees that can arise from successively inserting keys, and in particular present a bijection between such sequences (which we call histories) and a special type of increasing trees. We describe the set of permutations for the keys that belong to a given history, and also show how to use this bijection to analyse statistics associated with $B$-trees.</description>

      <title>Multiple SLEs for $\kappa\in (0,8)$: Coulomb gas integrals and pure partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give an explicit relationship of SLE partition functions with Coulomb gas formalism of conformal field theory. We first construct a family of SLE${}_\kappa$ partition functions as Coulomb gas integrals and derive their various properties. In accordance with an interpretation as probabilistic correlations in loop $O(n)$ models, they are always positive when $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$, while they may have zeroes for $\kappa\leq 8/3$. They also admit a Fr\"{o}benius series expansion that matches with the algebraic content from CFT. Moreover, we check that at the first level of fusion, they have logarithmic asymptotic behavior when $\kappa=8/3$ and $\kappa=8$, in accordance with logarithmic minimal models $M(2,1)$ and $M(2,3)$, respectively.
  Second, we construct SLE${}_\kappa$ pure partition functions and show that they are continuous in $\kappa\in (0,8)$ and they decay to zero as a polynomial of $(8-\kappa)$ when $\kappa\to 8$. We explicitly relate the Coulomb gas integrals and pure partition functions together in terms of the meander matrix. As a by-product, our results yield a construction of global non-simple multiple chordal SLE${}_\kappa$ measures ($\kappa \in (4,8)$) uniquely determined by their re-sampling property.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a $d$-dimensional long jumps symmetric exclusion with a slow barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the hydrodynamic limit of symmetric long-jumps exclusion in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for $d \geq 1$), where the jump rate is inversely proportional to a power of the jump's length with exponent $\gamma+1$, where $\gamma \geq 2$. Moreover, movements between $\mathbb{Z}^{d-1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{-}^{*}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^{d-1} \times \mathbb N$ are slowed down by a factor $\alpha n^{-\beta}$ (with $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\beta\geq 0$). In the hydrodynamic limit we obtain the heat equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary conditions or with Neumann boundary conditions, depending on the values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$. The (rather restrictive) condition in \cite{casodif} (for $d=1$) about the initial distribution satisfying an entropy bound with respect to a Bernoulli product measure with constant parameter is weakened or completely dropped.</description>

      <title>Concentration of a high dimensional sub-gaussian vector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07885v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note describes the concentration phenomenon for a high dimensional sub-gaussian vector \( X \). In the Gaussian case, for any linear operator \( Q \), it holds \( P\bigl( \| Q X \|^{2} - tr (B) &gt; 2 \sqrt{x\, tr(B^{2})} + 2 \| B \| x \bigr) \leq e^{-x} \) and \( P\bigl( \| Q X \|^{2} - tr (B) &lt; - 2 \sqrt{x \, tr(B^{2})} \bigr) \leq e^{-x} \) with \( B = Q \, Var(X) Q^{T} \); see \cite{laurentmassart2000}. This implies concentration of the squared norm \( \| Q X \|^{2} \) around its expectation \( E \| Q X \|^{2} = tr (B) \) provided that \( tr(B^2)/\| B \|^2 \) is sufficiently large. An extension of this result to a non-gaussian case is a nontrivial task even under sub-gaussian behavior of \( X \), especially if the entries of \( X \) cannot be assumed independent and Hanson-Wright type bounds do not apply. The results of this paper extend the Gaussian deviation bounds and support the concentration phenomenon for \( \| Q X \|^{2} \) using recent advances in Laplace approximation from \cite{SpLaplace2022} and \cite{katsevich2023tight}. The results are illustrated by the case when \( X \) is an i.i.d. sum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce asymptotic R\'enyi entropies as a parameterized family of invariants for random walks on groups. These invariants interpolate between various well-studied properties of the random walk, including the growth rate of the group, the Shannon entropy, and the spectral radius. They furthermore offer large deviation counterparts of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem. We prove some basic properties of asymptotic R\'enyi entropies that apply to all groups, and discuss their analyticity and positivity for the free group and lamplighter groups.</description>

      <title>Tail estimates for the stationary stochastic six vertex model and ASEP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the tail exponents for the height function of the stationary stochastic six vertex model in the moderate deviations regime. For the upper tail of the height function we find upper and lower bounds of matching order, with a tail exponent of $\frac{3}{2}$, characteristic of KPZ distributions. We also obtain an upper bound for the lower tail of the same order.
  Our results for the stochastic six vertex model hold under a restriction on the model parameters for which a certain "microscopic concavity" condition holds. Nevertheless, our estimates are sufficiently strong to pass through the degeneration of the stochastic six vertex model to the ASEP. We therefore obtain tail estimates for both the current as well as the location of a second class particle in the ASEP with stationary (Bernoulli) initial data. Our estimates complement the variance bounds obtained in the seminal work of Bal\'azs and Sepp\"al\"ainen.}</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and comparison theorem on unbounded solutions of general time interval BSDEs with sub-quadratic generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the existence, uniqueness and comparison theorem on unbounded solutions of one-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with sub-quadratic generators, where the terminal time is allowed to be finite or infinite. We first establish existence of the unbounded solutions for this kind of BSDEs with generator $g$ satisfying a time-varying one-sided linear growth in the first unknown variable $y$ and a time-varying sub-quadratic growth in the second unknown variable $z$. Then, the uniqueness and comparison theorem of the unbounded solutions for this kind of BSDEs are proved under a time-varying extended convexity assumption. These results generalized those obtained in \cite{12} to the general time interval BSDEs. Finally, several sufficient conditions ensuring that the uniqueness holds are put forward and verified via some innovative ideas, which are explored at the first time even though for the case of finite time interval BSDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper has two objectives: proving that the rate of convergence in distribution for mean-field models in CLT regime is $N^{-1/2}$, and obtaining explicit expressions for the infinitesimal generators of two types of measure-valued Markov processes (conditional law of McKean-Vlasov processes, and empirical measures of McKean-Vlasov systems). The proof of the convergence of mean-field system requires the second result about the generators, and both results need to study a notion of differentiability of measure-variable functions know as linear differentiability. Due to the particular framework that is studied, many technical difficulties arise compared to the existing literature. Two of the main problems are the following ones: the CLT regime implies that the limit measure-valued processes are not deterministic, and the empirical measure processes related to McKean-Vlasov equations with jumps are necessarily discontinuous. Both properties make the expressions of the generators more complicated than what is usually considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a case study for a recently introduced diffusion in the space of probability measures over the reals, namely rearranged stochastic heat, which solves a stochastic partial differential equation valued in the set of symmetrised quantile functions over the unit circle. This contribution studies probability measure-valued flows perturbed by this noise with a special focus on gradient flows. This is done by introducing a drift to the rearranged stochastic heat equation by means of a vector field from the set of random variables over the unit circle into itself. When the flow is a gradient flow, the vector field may coincide with the Wasserstein derivative of a mean-field potential function. The resulting equation reads as a sort of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation with an infinite dimensional common noise. This article provides conditions on the drift under which solutions exist uniquely for any time horizon and converge exponentially fast towards a unique equilibrium. When the drift derives from a potential, some metastability properties are obtained as the intensity of the noise is tuned to zero: it is shown that under a particular scaling regime, the gradient descent lingers near local minimizers for expected times of the same order as in the finite dimensional setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05761v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the asymptotic and large scale behavior of the eigenvalues of wavelet random matrices in high dimensions. We assume that possibly non-Gaussian, finite-variance $p$-variate measurements are made of a low-dimensional $r$-variate ($r \ll p$) fractional stochastic process with non-canonical scaling coordinates and in the presence of additive high-dimensional noise. The measurements are correlated both time-wise and between rows. We show that the $r$ largest eigenvalues of the wavelet random matrices, when appropriately rescaled, converge in probability to scale-invariant functions in the high-dimensional limit. By contrast, the remaining $p-r$ eigenvalues remain bounded in probability. Under additional assumptions, we show that the $r$ largest log-eigenvalues of wavelet random matrices exhibit asymptotically Gaussian distributions. The results have direct consequences for statistical inference.</description>

      <title>On the Keller-Segel models interacting with a stochastically forced incompressible viscous flow in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07217v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the Keller-Segel model coupled to stochastic Navier-Stokes equations (KS-SNS, for short), which describes the dynamics of oxygen and bacteria densities evolving within a stochastically forced incompressible viscous flow. Our main results establish the existence and uniqueness results of global solutions (strong in the probabilistic sense and weak in the PDE sense) to the KS-SNS system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. A novel approximate KS-SNS system with proper regularization and cut-off operators in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is introduced, and the existence of approximate solution is proved by some a priori uniform bounds and a careful analysis on the approximation scheme. Under different assumptions, two types of entropy-energy functional inequalities that seem to be new in their forms are derived, which together with the Prohorov's theorem and Jakubowski-Skorokhod theorem enable us to show that the sequence of approximate solutions converges to a global martingale weak solution. Moreover, when $\chi(\cdot)\equiv \textrm{const.}&gt;0$, we prove that the solution is pathwise unique, and hence by the Yamada-Wantanabe theorem that the KS-SNS system admits a unique global pathwise weak solution.</description>

      <title>Local approximations of inverse block Toeplitz matrices and Baxter-type theorems for long-memory processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive sharp approximation error bounds for inverse block Toeplitz matrices associated with multivariate long-memory stationary processes. The error bounds are evaluated for both column and row sums. These results are used to prove the strong convergence of the solutions of general block Toeplitz systems. A crucial part of the proof is to bound sums consisting of the Fourier coefficients of the phase function attached to the singular symbol of the Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

      <title>A subspace constrained randomized Kaczmarz method for structure or external knowledge exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a version of the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving systems of linear equations where the iterates are confined to the solution space of a selected subsystem. We show that the subspace constraint leads to an accelerated convergence rate, especially when the system has approximately low-rank structure. On Gaussian-like random data, we show that it results in a form of dimension reduction that effectively increases the aspect ratio of the system. Furthermore, this method serves as a building block for a second, quantile-based algorithm for solving linear systems with arbitrary sparse corruptions, which is able to efficiently utilize external knowledge about corruption-free equations and achieve convergence in difficult settings. Numerical experiments on synthetic and realistic data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods for even more general data models than guaranteed by the theory.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Law of Iterated Logarithm for Heavy Tailed Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study heavy tailed random variables obtained by sampling an observable with a power singularity along an orbit of an expanding map on the circle. In the regime where the observables have infinite variance, we show that the set of limit points of the ergodic sum process, rescaled by $N^{1/s} (\ln N)^\alpha$, where $s$ is the index of limiting stable law, equals to the set of piecewise constant increasing functions with finitely many jumps. The proof relies on the multiple Borel-Cantelli Lemma proven in Dolgopyat, Fayad and Liu [J. Mod. Dyn. 18 (2022) 209--289].</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in law of the surface quasi-geostrophic equations: the case of linear multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The momentum formulation of the surface quasi-geostrophic equations consists of two nonlinear terms, besides the pressure term, one of which cannot be written in a divergence form. When the anti-divergence operator is applied to such nonlinear terms, in general, one cannot take advantage of the differentiation operator of order minus one unless the nonlinear terms are compactly supported away from the origin in Fourier frequency. Moreover, the two nonlinear terms of the momentum surface quasi-geostrophic equations are one derivative more singular than that of the Navier-Stokes equations. Upon employing the convex integration technique to the random partial differential equations corresponding to the momentum surface quasi-geostrophic equations forced by linear multiplicative noise, these issues create various difficulties, unseen in the deterministic scenario and even in the case the noise is additive. By making a key observation in case the solution is a shear flow and rewriting the difficult stochastic commutator error in terms of the oscillation error, we prove its non-uniqueness in law.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares &amp; Gaussian Processes I: Certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new SoS hierarchy for a broad class of average-case problems. The new high-entropy steps (HES) SoS hierarchy certifies properties of input instances only over a certain family of well behaved distributions of possible solutions. This allows the hierarchy to circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure \cite[Lec.~1.2, Marley Paradigm]{barak2016proofs} by vastly reducing the set of solution concepts they need to be proven over.
  We evaluate the HES SoS hierarchy on a well-studied Gaussian process: the spherical spin-glass, which is a particular ensemble of random low-degree polynomials (LDPs). We prove that, given an instance sampled from the problem distribution, with high probability there exists a HES distribution that achieves value arbitrarily close to the conjectured optimal algorithmic threshold and, at the same time, there are low-degree SoS certificates that no HES distribution can achieve value above a constant factor times this threshold, improving over standard SoS whose certificates are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$ for a degree-$p$ random polynomial \cite{bhattiprolu2017sum, hopkins2017power}. We also give examples of anisotropic modifications to the spherical spin glass problem where there is proof (or strong evidence) that the HES SoS hierarchy does better than the only other known algorithm \cite{subag2021following}. We conjecture that the HES SoS hierarchy can be applied to any LDP approximate Gaussian process to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms.
  The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>The largest subgraph without a forbidden induced subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the systematic study of the following Tur\'an-type question. Suppose $\Gamma$ is a graph with $n$ vertices such that the edge density between any pair of subsets of vertices of size at least $t$ is at most $1 - c$, for some $t$ and $c &gt; 0$. What is the largest number of edges in a subgraph $G \subseteq \Gamma$ which does not contain a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph or, more generally, which belongs to a hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$? This provides a common generalization of two recently studied cases, namely $\Gamma$ being a (pseudo-)random graph and a graph without a large complete bipartite subgraph. We focus on the interesting case where $H$ is a bipartite graph.
  We determine the answer up to a constant factor with respect to $n$ and $t$, for certain bipartite $H$ and for $\Gamma$ either a dense random graph or a Paley graph with a square number of vertices. In particular, our bounds match if $H$ is a tree, or if one part of $H$ has $d$ vertices complete to the other part, all other vertices in that part have degree at most $d$, and the other part has sufficiently many vertices. As applications of the latter result, we answer a question of Alon, Krivelevich, and Samotij on the largest subgraph with a hereditary property which misses a bipartite graph, and determine up to a constant factor the largest number of edges in a string subgraph of $\Gamma$. The proofs are based on a variant of the dependent random choice and a novel approach for finding induced copies by inductively defining probability distributions supported on induced copies of smaller subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Liouville Flow Importance Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Perspective on Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics. Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser). We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system. To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting. We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds. Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples. We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.</description>
