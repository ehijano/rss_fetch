      <title>E-Graphs as Circuits, and Optimal Extraction via Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the optimal extraction problem for e-graphs by first showing a connection between e-graphs and cyclic monotone Boolean circuits, then solving the weighted satisfiability problem for such circuits. The solution is a parameterized algorithm based on treewidth. Additionally, we show how the circuit view of e-graphs allows us to apply simplification techniques that are not possible when operating directly on e-graphs. While the core parameterized algorithm may be adapted to work directly on e-graphs, the simplification results show why the circuit view is helpful.</description>

      <title>Unfairly Splitting Separable Necklaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Necklace Splitting problem is a classical problem in combinatorics that has been intensively studied both from a combinatorial and a computational point of view. It is well-known that the Necklace Splitting problem reduces to the discrete Ham Sandwich problem. This reduction was crucial in the proof of PPA-completeness of the Ham Sandwich problem. Recently, Borzechowski, Schnider and Weber [ISAAC'23] introduced a variant of Necklace Splitting that similarly reduces to the $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich problem, which lies in the complexity class UEOPL but is not known to be complete. To make this reduction work, the input necklace is guaranteed to be n-separable. They showed that these necklaces can be fairly split in polynomial time and thus this subproblem cannot be used to prove UEOPL-hardness for $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich. We consider the more general unfair necklace splitting problem on n-separable necklaces, i.e., the problem of splitting these necklaces such that each thief gets a desired fraction of each type of jewels. This more general problem is the natural necklace-splitting-type version of $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich, and its complexity status is one of the main open questions posed by Borzechowski, Schnider and Weber. We show that the unfair splitting problem is also polynomial-time solvable, and can thus also not be used to show UEOPL-hardness for $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>

      <title>A Persistent Hierarchical Bloom Filter-based Framework for Authentication and Tracking of ICs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) in unreliable supply chains demands robust tracking and authentication. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) offer unique IC identifiers, but noise undermines their utility. This study introduces the Persistent Hierarchical Bloom Filter (PHBF) framework, ensuring swift and accurate IC authentication with an accuracy rate of 100% across the supply chain even with noisy PUF-generated signatures.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Optimal Weak-to-Strong Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boosting is an extremely successful idea, allowing one to combine multiple low accuracy classifiers into a much more accurate voting classifier. In this work, we present a new and surprisingly simple Boosting algorithm that obtains a provably optimal sample complexity. Sample optimal Boosting algorithms have only recently been developed, and our new algorithm has the fastest runtime among all such algorithms and is the simplest to describe: Partition your training data into 5 disjoint pieces of equal size, run AdaBoost on each, and combine the resulting classifiers via a majority vote. In addition to this theoretical contribution, we also perform the first empirical comparison of the proposed sample optimal Boosting algorithms. Our pilot empirical study suggests that our new algorithm might outperform previous algorithms on large data sets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Testable Learning of General Halfspaces with Adversarial Label Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of testable learning of general -- not necessarily homogeneous -- halfspaces with adversarial label noise with respect to the Gaussian distribution. In the testable learning framework, the goal is to develop a tester-learner such that if the data passes the tester, then one can trust the output of the robust learner on the data.Our main result is the first polynomial time tester-learner for general halfspaces that achieves dimension-independent misclassification error. At the heart of our approach is a new methodology to reduce testable learning of general halfspaces to testable learning of nearly homogeneous halfspaces that may be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>Detecting cluster patterns in tensor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tensor consists of data, $t$, equipped with a multilinear product $\langle t|u_1,\ldots, u_{\ell}\rangle$, called a tensor contraction. Each vector $u_a$ comes from a space $U_a$ called an axis (or mode), the output $\langle t|u_1,\ldots, u_{\ell}\rangle$ lies in a base space $U_0$. In applications, axes often function as linear models of input parameters to a multiparameter process. The tensor then models the complex ways these parameters interact to produce a vector in the base which models outcomes. Thus some linear methods become accessible on a nonlinear problem.
  Many applications of tensors use decompositions $U_a=X_{a,1}\oplus \cdots \oplus X_{a,k_a}$ with a prescribed subset $\Delta$ of coordinates $(i_0,i_1,\ldots, i_{\ell})$, $1\leq i_a\leq k_a$, where \[
  (i_0,i_1,\ldots, i_{\ell})\not\in \Delta
  \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad
  \langle t|X_{1,i_1},\ldots, X_{\ell,i_{\ell}}\rangle \leq
  \sum_{j\neq i_0} X_{0,j}. \] We call $\Delta$ a cluster pattern and observe that these generalize familiar structures such as echelon forms, block diagonalization, orthogonal, eigen, and singular value decompositions, and clustering more broadly.
  This article introduces a class of efficiently computable cluster patterns that emerge from an underlying Lie theory of multilinear maps. The new family generalizes known cluster patterns such as Tucker decompositions and block diagonal decompositions but also includes decompositions that approximate curves and surfaces. The latter patterns can capture properties of data categories that do not decompose into the types of disjoint clustering for which existing methods are designed.</description>

      <title>Complexity of High-Dimensional Identity Testing with Coordinate Conditional Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identity testing problem for high-dimensional distributions. Given as input an explicit distribution $\mu$, an $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and access to sampling oracle(s) for a hidden distribution $\pi$, the goal in identity testing is to distinguish whether the two distributions $\mu$ and $\pi$ are identical or are at least $\varepsilon$-far apart. When there is only access to full samples from the hidden distribution $\pi$, it is known that exponentially many samples (in the dimension) may be needed for identity testing, and hence previous works have studied identity testing with additional access to various "conditional" sampling oracles. We consider a significantly weaker conditional sampling oracle, which we call the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$, and provide a computational and statistical characterization of the identity testing problem in this new model.
  We prove that if an analytic property known as approximate tensorization of entropy holds for an $n$-dimensional visible distribution $\mu$, then there is an efficient identity testing algorithm for any hidden distribution $\pi$ using $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ queries to the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$. Approximate tensorization of entropy is a pertinent condition as recent works have established it for a large class of high-dimensional distributions. We also prove a computational phase transition: for a well-studied class of $n$-dimensional distributions, specifically sparse antiferromagnetic Ising models over $\{+1,-1\}^n$, we show that in the regime where approximate tensorization of entropy fails, there is no efficient identity testing algorithm unless $\mathsf{RP}=\mathsf{NP}$. We complement our results with a matching $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ statistical lower bound for the sample complexity of identity testing in the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$ model.</description>

      <title>Solving Co-Path/Cycle Packing and Co-Path Packing Faster Than $3^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textsc{Co-Path/Cycle Packing} problem (resp. The \textsc{Co-Path Packing} problem) asks whether we can delete at most $k$ vertices from the input graph such that the remaining graph is a collection of induced paths and cycles (resp. induced paths). These two problems are fundamental graph problems that have important applications in bioinformatics. Although these two problems have been extensively studied in parameterized algorithms, it seems hard to break the running time bound $3^k$. In 2015, Feng et al. provided an $O^*(3^k)$-time randomized algorithms for both of them. Recently, Tsur showed that they can be solved in $O^*(3^k)$ time deterministically. In this paper, by combining several techniques such as path decomposition, dynamic programming, cut \&amp; count, and branch-and-search methods, we show that \textsc{Co-Path/Cycle Packing} can be solved in $O^*(2.8192^k)$ time deterministically and \textsc{Co-Path Packing} can be solved in $O^*(2.9241^{k})$ time with failure probability $\leq 1/3$. As a by-product, we also show that the \textsc{Co-Path Packing} problem can be solved in $O^*(5^p)$ time with probability at least 2/3 if a path decomposition of width $p$ is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>

Abstract: Over the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic aspects of designing single-elimination (SE) tournaments. Addressing natural questions of algorithmic tractability, we identify key properties of input instances that enable the tournament designer to efficiently schedule the tournament in a way that maximizes the chances of a preferred player winning. Much of the prior algorithmic work on this topic focuses on the perfect (complete and deterministic) information scenario, especially in the context of fixed-parameter algorithm design. Our contributions constitute the first fixed-parameter tractability results applicable to more general settings of SE tournament design with potential imperfect information.</description>

      <title>Online Probabilistic Metric Embedding: A General Framework for Bypassing Inherent Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic metric embedding into trees is a powerful technique for designing online algorithms. The standard approach is to embed the entire underlying metric into a tree metric and then solve the problem on the latter. The overhead in the competitive ratio depends on the expected distortion of the embedding, which is logarithmic in $n$, the size of the underlying metric. For many online applications, such as online network design problems, it is natural to ask if it is possible to construct such embeddings in an online fashion such that the distortion would be a polylogarithmic function of $k$, the number of terminals.
  Our first main contribution is answering this question negatively, exhibiting a \emph{lower bound} of $\tilde{\Omega}(\log k \log \Phi)$, where $\Phi$ is the aspect ratio of the set of terminals, showing that a simple modification of the probabilistic embedding into trees of Bartal (FOCS 1996), which has expected distortion of $O(\log k \log \Phi)$, is \emph{nearly-tight}. Unfortunately, this may result in a very bad dependence in terms of $k$, namely, a power of $k$.
  Our second main contribution is a general framework for bypassing this limitation. We show that for a large class of online problems this online probabilistic embedding can still be used to devise an algorithm with $O(\min\{\log k\log (k\lambda),\log^3 k\})$ overhead in the competitive ratio, where $k$ is the current number of terminals, and $\lambda$ is a measure of subadditivity of the cost function, which is at most $r$, the current number of requests. In particular, this implies the first algorithms with competitive ratio $\operatorname{polylog}(k)$ for online subadditive network design (buy-at-bulk network design being a special case), and $\operatorname{polylog}(k,r)$ for online group Steiner forest.</description>

      <title>Almost Instance-optimal Clipping for Summation Problems in the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private mechanisms achieving worst-case optimal error bounds (e.g., the classical Laplace mechanism) are well-studied in the literature. However, when typical data are far from the worst case, \emph{instance-specific} error bounds -- which depend on the largest value in the dataset -- are more meaningful. For example, consider the sum estimation problem, where each user has an integer $x_i$ from the domain $\{0,1,\dots,U\}$ and we wish to estimate $\sum_i x_i$. This has a worst-case optimal error of $O(U/\varepsilon)$, while recent work has shown that the clipping mechanism can achieve an instance-optimal error of $O(\max_i x_i \cdot \log\log U /\varepsilon)$. Under the shuffle model, known instance-optimal protocols are less communication-efficient. The clipping mechanism also works in the shuffle model, but requires two rounds: Round one finds the clipping threshold, and round two does the clipping and computes the noisy sum of the clipped data. In this paper, we show how these two seemingly sequential steps can be done simultaneously in one round using just $1+o(1)$ messages per user, while maintaining the instance-optimal error bound. We also extend our technique to the high-dimensional sum estimation problem and sparse vector aggregation (a.k.a. frequency estimation under user-level differential privacy).</description>
