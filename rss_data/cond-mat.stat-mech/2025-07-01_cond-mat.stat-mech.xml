      <title>An anomalous particle-exchange mechanism for two isolated Bose gases merged into one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)&lt;1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}&lt;\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.</description>

      <title>The effect of droplet configurations within the Functional Renormalization Group of low-dimensional Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations of the derivative expansion to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq 2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next (second) order of the derivative expansion, which turns out to be much more involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely, the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are nonperturbatively related.

      <title>A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modes of active Potts models with factorizable numbers of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of q-state Potts models with q = 4, 5, 6, and 8 using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the q homogeneous phases and q-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies, respectively, for all values of q. However, for a factorizable q value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For q = 6, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23939v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems (i.e., the parameters of the system lie on the boundary of the stability conditions). We analytically examine two distinct critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude. Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Minimally dissipative multi-bit logical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computing architectures are vastly more energy-dissipative than fundamental thermodynamic limits suggest, motivating the search for principled approaches to low-dissipation logical operations. We formulate multi-bit logical gates (bit erasure, NAND) as optimal transport problems, extending beyond classical one-dimensional bit erasure to scenarios where existing methods fail. Using entropically regularized unbalanced optimal transport, we derive tractable solutions and establish general energy-speed-accuracy trade-offs that demonstrate that faster, more accurate operations necessarily dissipate more energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Landauer limits cannot be trivially overcome in higher dimensional geometries. We develop practical algorithms combining optimal transport with generative modeling techniques to construct dynamical controllers that follow Wasserstein geodesics. These protocols achieve near-optimal dissipation and can, in principle, be implemented in realistic experimentally set-ups. The framework bridges fundamental thermodynamic limits with scalable computational design for energy-efficient information processing.</description>

      <title>Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c=H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis obtained with the Curie-Weiss model. Our work provides a panoramic view of the finite-time evolution of the stochastic $\phi^4$ model, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>Conformal scalar field theory from Ising tricriticality on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.</description>

      <title>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in ternary fluid mixtures: the role of wetting and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in multicomponent fluids is central to understanding the organization of complex materials and biological structures. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations offer a robust framework for modeling such systems, capturing both diffusive dynamics and hydrodynamic interactions. In this work, we investigate hyperuniformity, characterized by suppressed large-scale density fluctuations, in ternary fluid mixtures governed by the ternary CHNS equations. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations, we systematically explore the influence of wetting conditions and hydrodynamic effects on emergent hyperuniformity. Similar to binary systems we observe that the presence of hydrodynamics weakens the hyperuniform characteristics. However, also the wetting properties have an effect. We find that in partial wetting regimes, all three components exhibit comparable degrees of hyperuniformity. In contrast, for complete wetting scenarios, where one component preferentially wets the other two, the wetting component displays a significant reduction in hyperuniformity relative to the others. These findings suggest that wetting asymmetry can act as a control parameter for spatial order in multicomponent fluids.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature "Depletion" of Superfluid Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with aharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Quantum Information Lifetime in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</description>

For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.</description>

      <title>On Boltzmann Averaging in Ab Initio Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio thermodynamics is a widespread, computationally efficient approach to predict the stable configuration of a surface in contact with a surrounding (gas or liquid) environment. In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in the Inverted Triangular Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate diffusion in a two-dimensional inverted soft Lorentz gas, where attractive Fermi-type potential wells are arranged in a triangular lattice. This configuration contrasts with earlier studies of soft Lorentz gases involving repulsive scatterers. By systematically varying the gap width and softness of the potential, we explore a rich landscape of diffusive behaviors. We present numerical simulations of the mean squared displacement and compute diffusion coefficients, identifying tongue-like structures in parameter space associated with quasiballistic transport. Furthermore, we develop an extension to the Machta-Zwanzig approximation that incorporates correlated multi-hop trajectories and correct for the influence of localized periodic orbits. Our findings highlight the qualitative and quantitative differences between inverted and repulsive soft Lorentz gases and offer new insights into transport phenomena in smooth periodic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising model, originally developed for understanding magnetic phase transitions, has become a cornerstone in the study of collective phenomena across diverse disciplines. In this review, we explore how Ising and Ising-like models have been successfully adapted to sociophysical systems, where binary-state agents mimic human decisions or opinions. By focusing on key areas such as opinion dynamics, financial markets, social segregation, game theory, language evolution, and epidemic spreading, we demonstrate how the models describing these phenomena, inspired by the Ising model, capture essential features of collective behavior, including phase transitions, consensus formation, criticality, and metastability. In particular, we emphasize the role of the dynamical rules of evolution in the different models that often converge back to Ising-like universality. We end by outlining the future directions in sociphysics research, highlighting the continued relevance of the Ising model in the analysis of complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Decoding Noise in Nanofluidic Systems: Adsorption versus Diffusion Signatures in Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adsorption processes play a fundamental role in molecular transport through nanofluidic systems, but their signatures in measured signals are often hard to distinguish from other processes like diffusion. In this paper, we derive an expression for the power spectral density (PSD) of particle number fluctuations in a channel, accounting for diffusion and adsorption/desorption to a wall. Our model, validated by Brownian dynamics simulations, is set in a minimal yet adaptable geometry, allowing us to eliminate the effects of specific geometries. We identify distinct signatures in the PSD as a function of frequency $f$, including $1/f^{3/2}$ and $1/f^{1/2}$ scalings related to diffusive entrance and re-entrance effects, and a $1/f^2$ scaling associated with adsorption. These scalings appear in key predicted quantities -- the total number of particles in the channel and the number of adsorbed or unadsorbed particles -- and can dominate or combine in non-trivial ways depending on parameter values. Notably, when there is a separation of timescales between diffusion within the channel and adsorption/desorption times, the PSD can exhibit two distinct slopes in some of the predicted quantities. We provide a phase diagram to classify experimental systems based on predicted PSD shapes. These PSDs reflect measured properties in physical systems on the nano- and micro-scale, such as ion channels, nanopores, and electrochemical sensors, potentially offering insights into noisy experimental data.</description>

      <title>DNA Unzipping Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review focuses on the force-induced unzipping transition of double-stranded DNA. It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.</description>

Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under energy constraints in the observable universe.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.</description>

Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the understanding of their collective dynamics. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on a saddle-point analysis in the limit of high density and weak interactions between the particles, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute exactly the three- and four-point density correlation functions. This result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki equation beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.</description>

Abstract: A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves for sampling the given temperature are achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber in a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures is explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the accumulation of resources within a target due to the interplay between continual delivery, driven by 1D stochastic search processes, and sequential consumption. The assumption of sequential consumption is key because it changes the commonly used $G/M/\infty$ queue to a $G/M/c$ queue. Combining the theory of $G/M/c$ queues with the theory of first-passage times, we derive general conditions for the search process to ensure that the number of resources within the queue converges to a steady state and compute explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the number of resources within the queue at steady state. We then compare the performance of the $G/M/c$ queue with that of the $G/M/\infty$ queue for an increasing number of servers. We extend the model to consider two competing targets and show that, under specific scenarios, an additional target is beneficial to the original target. Finally, we study the effects of multiple searchers. Using renewal theory, we numerically compute the inter-arrival time density for $M$ searchers in the Laplace space, which allows us to exploit the explicit expressions for the steady-state statistics of the number of resources within $G/M/1$ and $G/M/\infty$ queues, and compare their behaviour with different numbers of searchers. Overall, the $G/M/c$ queue shows a tighter dependence on the configuration of the search process than the $G/M/\infty$ queue does.</description>

      <title>Exact results for spin glass criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Extended Structural Dynamics -- Emergent Irreversibility from Reversible Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are constrained to dilute gases and short timescales. In this work, we introduce Extended Structural Dynamics (ESD), a deterministic framework in which irreversibility arises from the internal geometry of structured particles. In ESD, particles possess finite size and internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, that are dynamically coupled to translational motion. This coupling induces instability, nonlinear feedback, and chaotic mixing in the extended phase space, even under time-reversal symmetric laws. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible volume of phase space, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) form measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times scaling as Trec. These results address the Loschmidt and Zermelo paradoxes without coarse-graining, randomness, or fine-tuning. We further extend the model to charged systems (cESD), where long-range electromagnetic interactions drive continuous structural coupling. ESD thus provides a deterministic and testable mechanism for emergent thermodynamic behavior, with applications ranging from mesoscopic systems to the cosmological arrow of time.</description>

Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>

      <title>Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&amp;P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.</description>

Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</description>

Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization in quantum many-body systems typically unfolds over timescales governed by intrinsic relaxation mechanisms. Yet, its spatial aspect is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject to coherent driving and dissipation at its boundaries, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). At intermediate drive strengths, we uncover a two-stage thermalization along the spatial dimension: phase coherence is rapidly lost near the drive, while amplitude relaxation occurs over much longer distances. This separation of scales gives rise to an extended hydrodynamic regime exhibiting anomalous temperature profiles, which we designate as a ``prethermal'' domain. At stronger drives, the system enters a nonthermal, non-chaotic finite-momentum condensate characterized by sub-Poissonian photon statistics and a spatially modulated phase profile, whose stability is undermined by quantum fluctuations. We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar mechanisms are likely to emerge in a broad class of extended driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning: A Linear Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50 percent threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50 percent threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</description>

Abstract: The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</title>

Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>

Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>
