      <title>A continuous transition from Type-C Quasi Periodic Oscillations to the Heartbeat state in the Black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) 4U 1630-47 using AstroSat observations from 10-19 March 2023, for the first time capturing a rare and rapid transition in variability properties. Within less than a day, the source evolved from a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) state, with centroid frequencies between 3-5 Hz, to the Heartbeat state, characterized by a broad peak in the power density spectrum at ~25 mHz, corresponding to a ~40 s modulation period. As the source evolved, it passed through a transition track where the QPO features weakened and ultimately disappeared in the Heartbeat state. In the hardness-intensity Diagram, the QPOs occur at higher hardness and lower intensity, followed by a brightening phase as the source moved towards the soft intermediate state, and finally reached the Heartbeat state through a transition towards lower hardness. In the power-color diagram, this transition is marked by a clear shift to a distinct region of power color space, separate from the range occupied by other observed states. This work establishes 4U 1630-47 as another system, apart from GRS 1915+105, where a continuous transition from QPO to Heartbeat state has been observed. Notably, 4U 1630-47 is the only system where the QPO is absent during the heartbeat state. This provides us with another probe to understand the physical mechanism governing this transition and the overall accretion mechanism in BHXRBs.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for continuous wave detection in pulsar timing arrays: Realistic pulsar noise and a gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), such as those produced by supermassive binary black holes at subparsec separations. The incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of these sources produces a gravitational wave background (GWB), while some individual sources may be resolvable as deterministic signals with slowly varying GW frequencies, which are often referred to as "continuous waves" (CWs). The Fp-statistic is a frequentist method of detecting these CWs. In this paper, we study how the presence of pulsar red noise and a GWB affect the Fp-statistic. We compare results when marginalizing over the red noise and using the maximum-likelihood values of the red noise, and find little difference between the two. We also present results of using the Fp-statistic to analyze the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where we find no evidence for CWs in agreement with the previously published Bayesian results.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of optical companions to the population of millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster M3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is a key ingredient to study binary and stellar evolution under extreme conditions. In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission, which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>The complicated nature of the X-ray emission from the field of the strongly lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxy PJ1053+60 at z=3.549</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of PJ1053+60, a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) at z=3.549 that is strongly lensed by a foreground group at z=0.837. We also present GNIRS spectroscopy confirming the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the southwest of PJ1053+60 ($AGN_{SW}$) at $z_{SW}$ = 1.373 $\pm$ 0.006. Using this redshift prior, we decompose the X-ray spectrum of PJ1053+60 into $AGN_{SW}$ and high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) components from the HyLIRG. The HMXB component has an unusually high luminosity, $\sim$ 50 times higher than calibration derived from local galaxies, and a characteristic photon index likely too flat to be caused by high-mass X-ray binaries at rest frame energies above a few keV. Our 2-D spatial decomposition also suggests a similarly high X-ray HMXB luminosity, although the limited spatial resolution prevents meaningful morphological constraints on the component. We conclude that the enhanced X-ray emission may only be explained by the presence of another AGN ($AGN_{FG}$) embedded in the foreground group lensing the PJ1053+60 system. The presence of $AGN_{FG}$ is further supported by the detection of a point-like radio continuum source that coincides with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) of the foreground lens. Our study demonstrates the limited capability of current X-ray observatories while highlighting the need for higher angular resolution observations to definitively characterize the nature of X-ray emission in distant, strongly lensed HyLIRGs.</description>

      <title>Plasma flow in force-free magnetospheres: two-fluid model near pulsars and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force-free electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic field of the magnetically dominated plasma found near pulsars and active black holes, but gives no information about the underlying particles that ultimately produce the observable emission. Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how particles can be "painted on" to a force-free solution as a function of boundary conditions that encode the particle output of "gap regions" where the force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional "field sheet spacetimes" experienced by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem. When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for global particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>A Face-on Accretion Disk Geometry Revealed by Millimeter-wave Periodicity in Sgr A$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed 77 epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archival data to investigate flux variability in Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$), the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Among these, we identified a rare but unusually clear and coherent ~52-minute sinusoidal modulation at 230 GHz, with a statistical significance exceeding 5{\sigma}. Modeling with a Doppler-boosted hotspot scenario yields an orbital radius of ~4 Schwarzschild radii and a disk inclination of 8$^\circ$ (or 172$^\circ$), providing the first direct millimeter wavelength constraint on the inner accretion flow geometry. This nearly face-on inclination is in good agreement with previous constraints from GRAVITY and EHT observations. These findings provide robust, independent evidence that millimeter-wave periodicity can directly probe the innermost accretion flow geometry, offering a powerful complement to variability studies at infrared and X-ray wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Search for Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background with 956.2 days of Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the search result for the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) in neutrino energies beyond 9.3~MeV in the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector with $22,500\times956.2$$~\rm m^3\cdot day$ exposure. %$22.5{\rm k}\times956.2$$~\rm m^3\cdot day$ exposure. Starting in the summer of 2020, SK introduced 0.01\% gadolinium (Gd) by mass into its ultra-pure water to enhance the neutron capture signal, termed the SK-VI phase. This was followed by a 0.03\% Gd-loading in 2022, a phase referred to as SK-VII. We then conducted a DSNB search using 552.2~days of SK-VI data and 404.0~days of SK-VII data through September 2023. This analysis includes several new features, such as two new machine-learning neutron detection algorithms with Gd, an improved atmospheric background reduction technique, and two parallel statistical approaches. No significant excess over background predictions was found in a DSNB spectrum-independent analysis, and 90\% C.L. upper limits on the astrophysical electron anti-neutrino flux were set. Additionally, a spectral fitting result exhibited a $\sim1.2\sigma$ disagreement with a null DSNB hypothesis, comparable to a previous result from 5823~days of all SK pure water phases.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-type Love number differentiating quark stars from neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark star (QS) is a hypothetical and yet undiscovered stellar object, and its existence would mark a paradigm shift in research on nuclear and quark matter. Although compactness is a well-known signature for distinguishing between two branches of QSs and neutron stars (NSs), some QSs can overlap with NSs in the radius-mass plane. To manifest their evident differences, we investigate the tidal properties of QSs and NSs. We then find that the magnetic-type Love number is a robust indicator for differentiating between QSs and NSs, whereas the electric-type one is insufficient when QSs and NSs have similar masses and radii. Finally, we show that gravitational waves from binary star mergers can be sensitive to differences between QSs and NSs to the detectable level.</description>

      <title>ELAIS-N1 Deep Field uGMRT Band-2: Constraints on Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high sensitivity, low radio frequency continuum observations of the ELAIS-N1 field with 32 hours of observations of the uGMRT Band-2 ($120-250$ MHz) covering $5.86\,\text{deg}^2$ area, achieving a central off-source RMS noise of $237\,\mu\mathrm{Jy}/\mathrm{beam}$ with a resolution of $11.45''$ at the central frequency of 183 MHz. A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission (DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\ell} = A({1000}/{\ell})^{\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3 observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\ell}$ in the form of $C_{\ell} = A{\nu^{-2{\alpha}}}{\ell^{-{\beta}}}$. Our result indicates a spectral break at $\nu = 230\,{\pm}\,5$ MHz, corresponding to a synchrotron age of $t_\text{syn} = 106\,{\pm}\,1$ Myr for the cosmic-ray electrons (CRe). This break result suggests a low-energy cutoff in the CRe population, leading to spectral curvature at low frequencies. Using both of the techniques, i-APS and t-APS, we find that the mean spectral index $\alpha$ and power-law index $\beta$ are consistent within the frequency range $120-500$ MHz.</description>

      <title>Characterising EP241107a: Multiwavelength Observations of an Einstein Probe-detected Fast X-ray Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) represent a new class of highly luminous transients in soft X-rays ($\sim$0.3-10 keV) associated with violent astrophysical processes. They manifest as short, singular flashes of X-ray photons with durations lasting from minutes to hours. Their origin remains unclear, and they have been associated with various progenitor mechanisms. The newly launched X-ray survey, Einstein-Probe (EP), is revolutionising this field by enabling the discovery and immediate follow-up of FXTs. Here we present the multiwavelength observations of EP-discovered FXT EP241107a and the discovery of its radio counterpart. Comparison of the optical and radio observations of EP241107a and its host properties with other extragalactic transients suggests a gamma-ray burst (GRB) origin. Through our afterglow modelling, we infer the GRB jet properties for EP241107a, yielding a jet of the isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy $E_{\mathrm{K,iso}} \sim10^{51}$ erg, with a half opening angle $\theta_{c}$ $\approx$15$^{\circ}$, viewed at an angle of $\theta_{\rm obs}$~$\approx$9$^{\circ}$. We also evaluate EP241107a in the landscape of both EP-discovered FXTs as well as the FXTs discovered from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning for Robust Classification of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unknown, population-level analyses can elucidate underlying structure in these signals. In this study, we employ deep learning methods to both classify FRBs and analyze structural patterns in the latent space learned from the first CHIME catalog. We adopt a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) architecture which combines the representational learning capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with a supervised classification task, thereby improving both classification performance and the interpretability of the latent space. We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess, spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing repeaters from non-repeaters. We also identify four non-repeating FRBs as repeater candidates, two of which have been independently flagged in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while preserving the quality of the inference.</description>

      <title>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.</description>

      <title>An Extremely Luminous Flare Recorded from a Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(&gt;30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.</description>

      <title>ASTROFLOW: A Real-Time End-to-End Pipeline for Radio Single-Pulse Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright, millisecond duration cosmic transients of unknown origin. The growing number of wide-field and high-time-resolution radio surveys, particularly with next-generation facilities such as the SKA and MeerKAT, will dramatically increase FRB discovery rates, but also produce data volumes that overwhelm conventional search pipelines. Real-time detection thus demands software that is both algorithmically robust and computationally efficient. We present Astroflow, an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio time-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface, Astroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum tiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access, shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s, 2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range of pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack, capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale surveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time transient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined with new data and models.</description>

      <title>General relativistic study of $f$-mode oscillations in neutron stars with gravitationally bound dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive investigation of nonradial oscillations in neutron star (NS) admixed with gravitationally bounded dark matter (DM) is carried out within the framework of full general relativity. The relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism is employed to illustrate the hadronic equation of state (EOS), while a physically motivated, gravitationally captured, non-uniform fermionic Higgs-portal DM component is incorporated to model DM-admixed NS. The DM distribution is characterized by two free parameters: $\alpha M_\chi$, an effective scaling factor that combines the DM concentration and the DM candidate mass, and $\beta$, a steepness index controlling the DM density distribution. The quasi normal mode (QNM) characteristics such as fundamental ($f$) mode frequency and its corresponding gravitational-wave (GW) damping time ($\tau$) is calculated for DM-admixed NS by solving the general relativistic perturbed equations involving axial as well as polar modes. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of DM distribution modifies the $f$-mode frequency and enhances the damping rate, reflecting a stronger coupling between matter and spacetime perturbations. Considering DM effects, the correlation analysis among DM model parameters, NS observables and QNM characteristics also carried out. Analytic fits for the $f-C-\tau$ and $f-\Lambda -\tau$ relations are constructed and calibrated for DM-admixed NS models. Building upon asteroseismic universal relations (URs), multimessenger constraint from the GW170817 event is employed by mapping the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ into the $(f_{1.4},\tau_{1.4})$ space, thereby providing observational bounds on the oscillation properties of canonical DM-admixed NS model.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.</description>

      <title>GW231123 ringdown: interpretation as multimodal Kerr signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is a short-duration, low-frequency gravitational wave signal consistent with a binary black hole coalescence and dominated by the merger-ringdown regime due to the high mass of the source. We demonstrate that fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone, improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency and damping rate spectrum to within $\pm10\%$ at the 90$\%$ credible level using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\pm8\%$ constraints using a model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain. Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary formation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have astrophysical implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blazar 3C 454.3 experienced a major flare in November 2010, making it the brightest $\gamma$-ray source in the sky of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We obtain seven daily consecutive spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the flare in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands with publicly available data. We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a "standing feature" where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetised plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single "moving blob" does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\nu_{\mu}$ per year. Finally, we extrapolate our model findings to the light curves of all Fermi-LAT flat-spectrum radio quasars. We find that next-generation neutrino telescopes are expected to detect approximately one multimessenger ($\gamma + \nu_{\mu}$) flare per year from bright blazars with neutrino peak energy in the hundreds TeV -- hundreds PeV energy range and show that the electromagnetic flare peak can precede the neutrino arrival by months to years.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars as high-energy neutrino sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical sources responsible for the production of high-energy neutrinos remain largely uncertain. The strongest associations suggest a correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei. However, it is still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting supermassive black hole are responsible for their production. In this paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino events and a large, optically selected quasar catalogue extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet quasars from flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) based on radio emission data from the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalogue. While all the associations between neutrino events and radio-quiet quasars are consistent with being random matches, FSRQs exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino positions. Additionally, we observe that the distribution of minimum distances between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find that the high-declination event distribution deviates strongly (4 sigma) from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication that a large fraction of the neutrino events (&gt;60%) observed by IceCube could be produced by the FSRQs and that the emission mechanism is likely related to the relativistic jets rather than the radio-quiet component of these sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.</description>

      <title>Predicting the X-ray signatures of the imminent T Coronae Borealis outburst through 3D hydrodynamic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in 1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare opportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary medium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray signatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk, and equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from a CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its density. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst, varying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we synthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton and XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic novae, with a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is collimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar shock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot wake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few hours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\sim 1$ week-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by shocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked ambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to absorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph and V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X} \approx 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower CBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Confirms GW231123 is a "Lite" Intermediate Mass Black Hole Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of "lite" intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes &gt;100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with &gt;70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.</description>

      <title>The changing look of the neutrino-emitter blazar candidate 5BZQ J1243+4043</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, changing-look blazars have called the traditional view of BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars into question within the empirical classification of blazars. Based on the intensity of optical lines, they appear to transition between the two classes over time. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported as a changing-look blazar in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime across different epochs. This study presents new optical spectroscopy observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with Gran Telescopio Canarias. We used this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical properties of the source. In particular, we used the emission lines to probe the accretion regime. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043 shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and the redshift z = 1.5181$\pm$0.0002 known from the literature. For the second epoch, the spectrum appears featureless and so, we placed limits on the emission lines and related properties. We observed spectral variability for both the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Nonetheless, the accretion properties of the blazar generally remain unvaried, indicating that the intrinsic physics stays the same across the three epochs. In the broader multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 is still characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies, which may foster neutrino production.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales. Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers. Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been seen already.</description>

      <title>Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar -- I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Costless correction of chain based nested sampling parameter estimation in gravitational wave data and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling parameter estimation differs from evidence estimation, in that it incurs an additional source of uncertainty. This uncertainty affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard uncertainty estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this uncertainty more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual uncertainty estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this uncertainty correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this uncertainty affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.</description>

      <title>Accelerated nested sampling with posterior repartitioning and $\beta$-flows for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for a given evidence precision by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows for posterior repartitioning. Notably, $\beta$-flows are able to recover posteriors and evidences which are generally consistent with those from traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quasi-Dirac neutrinos in diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the sources of astrophysical neutrinos are still unknown, they are believed to be produced by a population of sources in the distant universe. Measurements of the diffuse, all-sky astrophysical flux can thus be sensitive to flavor and energy-dependent propagation effects, such as very long baseline oscillations. These oscillations are present in certain neutrino mass models, such as when neutrinos are quasi-Dirac. Assuming generic models for the source flux, we find that these oscillations can still be resolved even when integrated over wide distributions in source redshift. We use two sets of IceCube all-sky flux measurements, made with muon and all-flavor neutrino samples, to set constraints at the $3\sigma$ level on quasi-Dirac mass-splittings between $(5 \times 10^{-19}, 8 \times 10^{-19})~\textrm{eV}^2$. We also consider systematic uncertainties on the source population and find that our results are robust under alternate spectral hypotheses or physical redshift distributions. Our analysis shows that spectral features in the all-sky neutrino measurements provide strong constraints on massive neutrino scenarios and are sensitive to uncharted parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Density Profile Around a Newborn First Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$pc.We find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Triples vs. Globular Clusters: Binary black hole merger eccentricity distributions compete and evolve with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation mechanisms of merging binary black holes (BBHs) observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration remain uncertain. Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>Vacuum breakdown around a Kerr black hole surrounded by a magnetic field</title>

Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available to the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the pair number density, the average energy per pair, and the pair energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>U-spin symmetry energy and hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining the (u,d) I-spin doublets or (d,s) U-spin doublets, the SU(3) flavor symmetry of light quarks can be decomposed into SU(2)$_I\times$U(1)$_Y$ or SU(2)$_U\times$U(1)$_Q$ subgroups, which have been widely adopted to categorize hadrons and their decay properties. The I-spin counterpart for the interactions among nucleons has been extensively investigated, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, which characterizes the variation of binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio in a nuclear system. In this work, we propose U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ for hyperonic matter to characterize the variation of the binding energy with the inclusion of hyperons. In particular, being the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$ hyperons are included in dense matter, where the U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is fixed according to state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysical observations using Bayesian inference approach. It is found that $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is much smaller than that of $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, indicating much stronger proton-neutron attraction than that of nucleon-hyperon pairs. Consequently, $\Lambda$ hyperon potential increases significantly and becomes repulsive at large density, where there is more than 80\% probability that $\Lambda$ hyperons do not emerge in neutron stars. For those undergoing emergence within neutron stars, the onset density of $\Lambda$ hyperons $n_\mathrm{b}^\Lambda$ is typically larger than $\sim$0.8 fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to neutron stars more massive than 1.7 $M_\odot$.</description>
