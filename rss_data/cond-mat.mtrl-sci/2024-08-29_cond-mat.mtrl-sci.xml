      <title>Biaxial strain tuning of excitons in monolayer MoSe$_2$ by high-temperature physical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present strain tuning of excitonic emission in monolayer MoSe$_2$ by using a high-temperature physical vapor deposition (PVD). The use of two amorphous substrates, Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$, provides two setpoints to induce distinct amounts of \textit{biaxial} tensile strain determined by a thermal expansion mismatch between the monolayer and the substrate. The tuning rate of the $A$-exciton transition energy is found to be 103 meV/\% by photoluminescence (PL), which represents the highest value realized by biaxial strain in transition metal dichalcogenides. The biaxial nature of the tensile strain is confirmed by polarization-resolved second harmonic generation, which reveals unperturbed in-plane three-fold symmetry of the monolayer. Furthermore, a softening of $A_\mathrm{1g}$ out-of-plane lattice vibration is identified in the Raman spectroscopy, which is known to be insignificant for uniaxial strain. Concomitantly, PL mapping of our PVD monolayers demonstrates (i) larger strain occurs in the interior of the mono-domain islands compared to the edges and (ii) the absence of island-size dependence in the magnitude of induced strain. Our results demonstrate an effective path towards strain engineering of excitons by using growth substrates, which holds great promise as a building block for future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized antiferromagnets have recently gained significant interest because they combine the advantages of both ferromagnets (spin polarization) and antiferromagnets (absence of net magnetization) for spintronics applications. In particular, spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals can be useful as active spintronics materials because of their high electrical and thermal conductivities and their ability to host strong interactions between charge transport and magnetic spin textures. We review spin and charge transport phenomena in spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals, in which the interplay of metallic conductivity and spin-split bands offers novel practical applications and new fundamental insights into antiferromagnetism. We focus on three types of antiferromagnets: canted antiferromagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and collinear altermagnets. We also discuss how the investigation of spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals can open doors to future research directions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of atomic structures with prior probabilities from universal interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of atomic structures plays a pivotal role in understanding and designing materials with desired properties. However, conventional methods often struggle with the formidable task of navigating the vast potential energy surface, especially in high-dimensional spaces with numerous local minima. Recent advancements in machine learning-driven surrogate models offer a promising avenue for alleviating this computational burden. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of universal machine learning potentials with a Bayesian approach of the GOFEE/BEACON framework. By leveraging the comprehensive chemical knowledge encoded in pretrained universal machine learning potentials as a prior estimate of energy and forces, we enable the Gaussian process to focus solely on capturing the intricate nuances of the potential energy surface. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through comparative analyses across diverse systems, including periodic bulk materials, surface structures, and a cluster.</description>

      <title>Grand canonical generative diffusion model for crystalline phases and grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion model has emerged as a powerful tool for generating atomic structures for materials science. This work calls attention to the deficiency of current particle-based diffusion models, which represent atoms as a point cloud, in generating even the simplest ordered crystalline structures. The problem is attributed to particles being trapped in local minima during the score-driven simulated annealing of the diffusion process, similar to the physical process of force-driven simulated annealing. We develop a solution, the grand canonical diffusion model, which adopts an alternative voxel-based representation with continuous rather than fixed number of particles. The method is applied towards generation of several common crystalline phases as well as the technologically important and challenging problem of grain boundary structures.</description>

      <title>A quasi-ohmic back contact achieved by inserting single-crystal graphene in flexible Kesterite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible photovoltaics with a lightweight and adaptable nature that allows for deployment on curved surfaces and in building facades have always been a goal vigorously pursued by researchers in thin-film solar cell technology. The recent strides made in improving the sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency of kesterite Cu$_{2}$ZnSn(S, Se)$_{4}$ (CZTSSe) suggest it to be a perfect candidate. However, making use of rare Mo foil in CZTSSe solar cells causes severe problems in thermal expansion matching, uneven grain growth, and severe problems at the back contact of the devices. Herein, a strategy utilizing single-crystal graphene to modify the back interface of flexible CZTSSe solar cells is proposed. It will be shown that the insertion of graphene at the Mo foil/CZTSSe interface provides strong physical support for the subsequent deposition of the CZTSSe absorber layer, improving the adhesion between the absorber layer and the Mo foil substrate. Additionally, the graphene passivates the rough sites on the surface of the Mo foil, enhancing the chemical homogeneity of the substrate, and resulting in a more crystalline and homogeneous CZTSSe absorber layer on the Mo foil substrate. The detrimental reaction between Mo and CZTSSe has also been eliminated. Through an analysis of the electrical properties, it is found that the introduction of graphene at the back interface promotes the formation of a quasi-ohmic contact at the back contact, decreasing the back contact barrier of the solar cell, and leading to efficient collection of charges at the back interface. This investigation demonstrates that solution-based CZTSSe photovoltaic devices could form the basis of cheap and flexible solar cells.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of $p$-type BiSbTe Through Incorporation of Magnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is evidence that magnetism can potentially increase the thermopower of materials, most likely due to magnon scattering, suggesting the incorporation of intrinsic magnetic semiconductors in non-magnetic thermoelectric materials. Here, samples of $\textit{p}$-type Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_{3}$ with 10 at.% excess Te are ball-milled with varying ratio of the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSb (0, 0.125, 0.5, and 1 wt.%) to prepare bulk samples by spark plasma sintering technique. The thermopower of samples containing CrSb is increased due to an increase in the effective mass of the charge carriers, indicating that there is a drag effect originating from the magnetic particles. However, this was at the expense of reduced electrical conductivity caused by reduced charge carrier mobility. While overall only marginal improvements in power factors were observed, these samples exhibited significantly lower thermal conductivity compared to the single-phase material. As a result, a peak $\textit{zT}$ value of $\sim$1.4 was achieved at 325 K for the sample with 0.125 wt.% CrSb. These results highlight the potential of incorporating magnetic secondary phases to enhance the thermoelectric performance of materials.</description>

      <title>Interlayer and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnetic trilayers: first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction within and between two magnetic cobalt layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer through ab initio calculations. We investigate different materials for the non-magnetic layer, focusing on the experimentally realized Co/Ag/Co system. We laterally shift the atoms in the non-magnetic layer to achieve the symmetry breaking required for the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We compare the resulting interactions with the L\'evy-Fert model and observe a good overall agreement between the model and the ab initio calculations for the dependence on the atomic positions. Additionally, we derive a formula for the strength of the interlayer isotropic exchange interaction depending on the position of the atoms in the non-magnetic layer and compare it to the first-principles results. We investigate the limitations of the L\'evy-Fert model by turning off the spin-orbit coupling separately on the non-magnetic and magnetic atoms and by studying the effect of band filling. Our work advances the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and gives insight into possible new material combinations with strong interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Enhancement of Piezoelectricity in Wurtzite Nitride Semiconductors via Thermal Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incorporation of rare-earth elements in wurtzite nitride semiconductors, e.g., scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (ScAlN), promises dramatically enhanced piezoelectric responses, critical to a broad range of acoustic, electronic, photonic, and quantum devices and applications. Experimentally, however, the measured piezoelectric responses of nitride semiconductors are far below what theory has predicted. Here, we show that the use of a simple, scalable, post-growth thermal annealing process can dramatically boost the piezoelectric response of ScAlN thin films. We achieve a remarkable 3.5-fold increase in the piezoelectric modulus, d33 for 30% Sc content ScAlN, from 12.3 pC/N in the as-grown state to 45.5 pC/N, which is eight times larger than that of AlN. The enhancement in piezoelectricity has been unambiguously confirmed by three separate measurement techniques. Such a dramatic enhancement of d33 has been shown to impact the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient kt2 : increasing it from 13.8% to 76.2%, which matches the highest reported values in millimeter thick lithium niobate films but is achieved in a 100 nm ScAlN with a 10,000 fold reduction in thickness, thus promising extreme frequency scaling opportunities for bulk acoustic wave resonators for beyond 5G applications. By utilizing a range of material characterization techniques, we have elucidated the underlying mechanisms for the dramatically enhanced piezoelectric responses, including improved structural quality at the macroscopic scale, more homogeneous and ordered distribution of domain structures at the mesoscopic scale, and the reduction of lattice parameter ratio (c/a) for the wurtzite crystal structure at the atomic scale. Overall, the findings present a simple yet highly effective pathway that can be extended to other material families to further enhance their piezo responses.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate machine-learned interatomic potentials for large-scale simulations of Cu, Al and Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become widely used in the development of interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations. However, most ML potentials are still much slower than classical interatomic potentials and are usually trained with near equilibrium simulations in mind. In this work, we develop ML potentials for Cu, Al and Ni using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method. Specifically, we create the low-dimensional tabulated versions (tabGAP) of the potentials, which allow for two orders of magnitude higher computational efficiency than the GAPs, enabling simulations of large multi-million atomic systems. The ML potentials are trained using diverse curated databases of structures and include fixed external repulsive potentials for short-range interactions. The potentials are extensively validated and used to simulate a wide range of fundamental materials properties, such as stacking faults and threshold displacement energies. Furthermore, we use the potentials to simulate single-crystal uniaxial compressive loading in different crystal orientations with both pristine simulation cells and cells containing pre-existing defects.</description>

      <title>A "Redox-free" Synthesis of CZTS Nano Ink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large open-circuit (V$_{oc}$) deficit restricts current kesterite device performance. The primary challenge is to achieve control over the phase composition and purity of the kesterite absorber. This is hampered by the fact that the metals copper and tin have multiple valence states and this leads inevitably to the formation of multiple phases. Specifically for solution-based fabrication procedures for kesterite, the pursuit of phase purity extends to the synthesis of CZTS precursor solution or nanoparticle dispersed inks (nano inks). In this work, a "redox-free" synthesis of CZTS nano ink is developed by mixing metal precursors with careful valence state control in non-toxic solvents. The issue of secondary phase formation during the synthesis process of kesterite is effectively resolved. Additionally, molecular solutions and nanoparticle inks with identical compositions exhibit significantly different abilities in phase control. Nanoparticles pre-synthesized in the solution state exhibit superior phase control by following a more ideal phase formation path. This provides a new pathway for the synthesis of kesterite with unprecedented control of the phase composition and purity.</description>

      <title>Influence of Yttrium(Y) on properties of Lanthanum Cobalt Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials exhibit various types of phase transitions at different temperatures, with many also demonstrating polymorphism. Doping materials can significantly alter their conductivity. In light of this, we have investigated the electrical conductivity of $LaCoO_3$, specifically its temperature dependence when doped with Yttrium (Y). The crystal structure of Lanthanum Yttrium Cobalt oxide $(La_{1-x}Y_x Co O_3)$ adopts a perovskite form, characterized by the general stoichiometry $ABX_3$, where A and B are cations, and X is an anion. This material undergoes a magnetic phase transition between $50-100$ K, a structural phase transition between $100-300$ K, and an insulator-to-metal transition at $500$ K. At room temperature, $LaCoO_3$ exhibits polaron-type hopping conduction. Our aim was to understand the electrical conductivity at $300$ K and how it varies with temperature when $La^{3+}$ is replaced by $Y^{3+}$. The electrical properties of the perovskite crystal are consistent with small polaron hopping conduction, which theoretically follows Mott's variable range hopping model, where conductivity obeys an exponential law, and resistivity follows an inverse exponential pattern. In this work, we compare the experimental resistivity graph with the theoretical inverse of the conductivity graph, showing that our experimental results align with the polaron hopping conduction model within a certain range. Additionally, the experiment confirms polymorphism in various cases. We observed that increasing the concentration of $Y^{3+}$ enhances the metallic properties of $La_{1-x} Y_x Co O_3$, and we found a significant correlation between conductivity and symmetry. Furthermore, the study highlights the material's phase transitions and polymorphic behavior.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals on Dependence of Volume on Pressure and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common wisdom that volume decreases with pressure and increases with temperature is analyzed in terms of Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics in the present work. It is shown that the derivative of volume to pressure in a stable system is always negative, i.e., volume decreases with the increase of pressure, when all other natural variables of the system are kept constant. This originates from the stability requirement that the conjugate variables, such as volume and negative pressure, must change in the same direction in a stable system. Consequently, since volume and temperature are not conjugate variables, they do not have to change in the same direction and thus do change in opposite directions in both natural and man-made systems. It is shown that the decrease of volume with the increase of temperature, commonly referred as negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the literature, originates from the statistical competitions of configurations in the system when the volumes of metastable configurations are smaller than that of the ground-state configuration. It is demonstrated that the zentropy theory can concisely explain and accurately predict NTE based on the density functional theory without fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Stability and localization of nanoscale skyrmions and bimerons in an all-magnetic van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons show great promise for both fundamental research and spintronic applications. Stabilizing and controlling topological spin textures in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials has gained tremendous attention due to high tunability, enhanced functionality, and miniaturization. Using rigorous first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we predict the existence of multiple magnetic solitons in an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (FGT/CGT). N\'eel-type skyrmions are formed at both sides of FGT/CGT with opposite chirality. Skyrmions at the FGT layer and bimerons at the CGT layer persist in the heterostructure at zero field, while the latter undergoes bimeron-skyrmion transformation if a field is applied. We further demonstrate that, although skyrmions and bimerons are topologically equivalent, they exhibit very different localization behavior. Skyrmions are isotropically localized, while bimerons exhibit anisotropic nonlocality, leading to finite-size effects. We analyze how this affects the stability of bimerons in confined materials. Our work represents an important step forward in the fundamental properties of topological spin textures and paves the way toward skyrmionic devices based on atomically thin vdW heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Absorption of elastic waves in complex media often depends on frequency in a linear way for both longitudinal and shear waves. This universal property occurs in media such as rocks, unconsolidated sediments, and human tissue. Absorption is due to relaxation processes at atomic scale up to the sub-micron scale of biological materials, and we argue that these processes are thermally activated. Unusual for ultrasonics and seismics, we can therefore express absorption as an integral over an activation energy landscape weighted by an energy distribution. The universal power-law property corresponds to a flat activation energy landscape corresponding to maximal randomness.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free neural operators for stress field modeling in polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the current work is the development and comparison of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for surrogate modeling of the quasi-static mechanical response of polycrystalline materials. Three types of such FNOs are considered here: a physics-guided FNO (PgFNO), a physics-informed FNO (PiFNO), and a physics-encoded FNO (PeFNO). These are trained and compared with the help of stress field data from a reference model for heterogeneous elastic materials with a periodic grain microstructure. Whereas PgFNO training is based solely on these data, that of the PiFNO and PeFNO is in addition constrained by the requirement that stress fields satisfy mechanical equilibrium, i.e., be divergence-free. The difference between the PiFNO and PeFNO lies in how this constraint is taken into account; in the PiFNO, it is included in the loss function, whereas in the PeFNO, it is "encoded" in the operator architecture. In the current work, this encoding is based on a stress potential and Fourier transforms. As a result, only the training of the PiFNO is constrained by mechanical equilibrium; in contrast, mechanical equilibrium constrains both the training and output of the PeFNO. Due in particular to this, stress fields calculated by the trained PeFNO are significantly more accurate than those calculated by the trained PiFNO in the example cases considered.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast symmetry control in photoexcited quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry control is essential for realizing unconventional properties, such as ferroelectricity, nonlinear optical responses, and complex topological order, thus it holds promise for the design of emerging quantum and photonic systems. Nevertheless, fast and reversible control of symmetry in materials remains a challenge, especially for nanoscale systems. Here, we unveil reversible symmetry changes in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on picosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction and total X-ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic-scale structural modeling and first-principles calculations, we reveal that symmetry-broken lead sulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation. The symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which suppress lead off-centering for about 100 ps. Furthermore, the change in symmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties as shown by transient optical measurements. Overall, this study elucidates reversible symmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new methodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Electronic states in superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal: 1T-PdSeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the surface and bulk electronic structures of the superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal 1T-PdSeTe. The superconducting transition temperature $T_C = 3.2$ K was almost twice as high as $T_C = 1.6$ K in 1T-PdTe$_2$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements showed homogeneously mixed Se and Te atoms in the chalcogen layers, consistent with the CdI$_2$-type crystal structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations indicated the existence of the topological surface states, and the overall band structures were similar to those of 1T-PdTe$_2$. These results suggest that CdI$_2$-type lattice symmetry dictates the band dispersion, regardless of atomic disorder in the chalcogen layers. As the electronic band dispersion and the local structures were persistent upon substitution, the enhancement of $T_C$ is likely associated with the chemical pressure. Our results provide insight into the effects of the solid solution on the surface and bulk electronic states as well as the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-range opposite charge repulsion in multivalent salt solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrostatic correlations between ions profoundly influence the structure and forces within electrical double layers. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian Renormalized Fluctuation theory to investigate the counter-intuitive phenomenon of repulsion between two oppositely charged surfaces and discuss its relationship with overcharging. By accurately accounting for the effect of spatially varying ion-ion correlations, we capture these repulsive forces for divalent, trivalent as well as tetravalent ions, in quantitative agreement with reported simulation results. We show that the opposite-charge repulsion is long-ranged with an effective length scale of a few nanometers. The strength of opposite-charge repulsion increases monotonically with the multivalent salt concentration, in stark contrast with the non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of other ion correlation-driven phenomena, such as overcharging and like-charge attraction. We also elucidate that the origin of the opposite-charge repulsion is the large amount of ions attracted to the double layer as a result of ion-ion correlations, leading to higher osmotic pressure and stronger screening of the electrostatic attraction, which results in an overall repulsive force between two oppositely charged surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between opposite-charge repulsion and the overcharging of the surface. Opposite-charge repulsion is accompanied by overcharging at large separation distances, but can also occur in normal double layers without overcharging at intermediate separation distances.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Transport of Thermally-Generated Magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the non-reciprocity of electrically and thermally-generated incoherent magnon transport using the magnetization direction of a Py wire placed on top of an ultrathin YIG film. We show that the transport properties of thermally-generated magnons under a Py wire depends on the relative orientation between the temperature gradient and the Py-magnetization direction. The symmetries of this non-reciprocal magnon transport match with those predicted by the remote dipolar interaction between YIG and Py magnons, controlled by the chirality of the YIG magnon dipolar stray fields. We also show that the directional magnon generation by the spin Seebeck effect from the Py wire displays the symmetries expected from the chiral spin Seebeck effect.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Benchmark and Framework for Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of structure-spectrum relationships is essential for spectral interpretation, impacting structural elucidation and material design. Predicting spectra from molecular structures is challenging due to their complex relationships. Herein, we introduce NMRNet, a deep learning framework using the SE(3) Transformer for atomic environment modeling, following a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. To support the evaluation of NMR chemical shift prediction models, we have established a comprehensive benchmark based on previous research and databases, covering diverse chemical systems. Applying NMRNet to these benchmark datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in both liquid-state and solid-state NMR datasets, demonstrating its robustness and practical utility in real-world scenarios. This marks the first integration of solid and liquid state NMR within a unified model architecture, highlighting the need for domainspecific handling of different atomic environments. Our work sets a new standard for NMR prediction, advancing deep learning applications in analytical and structural chemistry.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for enhanced electron-phonon interactions and high-$T_c$ superconductivity in engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the properties of engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices where an array of nano-clusters of a simple (single band) metal are embedded periodically inside another simple metal with a different work function. The exploration is done using a simplified tight-binding model with Coulomb interactions included, as well as density functional theory. Taking arrays of "Ag" clusters of fixed sizes and configurations (when unrelaxed) embedded periodically in an "Au" matrix as an example, we show that a significant enhancement of electron-phonon interactions ensues, implying possibilities for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The enhancement stems from a strong coupling, via Coulomb interactions, between the dipolar charge distribution that forms at the Au-Ag interfaces and the breathing and other modes of vibration of the light Ag atoms caged inside the heavier Au matrix. The interface dipoles form because of the interplay between the mismatch of the local potential seen by the conduction electrons localised in Wannier orbitals at the Ag and Au sites (the Ag sites being slightly repulsive relative to the Au sites) and the (long-range) Coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying these Wannier orbitals. We also discuss the DC transport in such systems.</description>

      <title>Classifying topological floppy modes in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In floppy mechanical lattices, robust edge states and bulk Weyl modes are manifestations of underlying topological invariants. To explore the universality of these phenomena independent of microscopic detail, we formulate topological mechanics in the continuum. By augmenting standard linear elasticity with additional fields of soft modes, we define a continuum version of Maxwell counting, which balances degrees of freedom and mechanical constraints. With one additional field, these augmented elasticity theories can break spatial inversion symmetry and harbor topological edge states. We also show that two additional fields are necessary to harbor Weyl points in two dimensions, and define continuum invariants to classify these states. In addition to constructing the general form of topological elasticity based on symmetries, we derive the coefficients based on the systematic homogenization of microscopic lattices. By solving the resulting partial differential equations, we efficiently predict coarse-grained deformations due to topological floppy modes without the need for a detailed lattice-based simulation. Our discovery formulates novel design principles and efficient computational tools for topological states of matter, and points to their experimental implementation in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of surface interactions experienced by sticky microcapsules made from environmentally benign materials</title>

Abstract: We present a study combining experimental measurements, theoretical analysis, and simulations to investigate core-shell microcapsules interacting with a solid boundary, with a particular focus on understanding the short-range potential energy well arising from the tethered force. The microcapsules, fabricated using a Pickering emulsion template with a cinnamon oil core and calcium alginate shell, were characterized for size (5-6 microns in diameter) and surface charge (-20 mV). We employed total internal reflection microscopy and particle tracking to measure the microcapsule-boundary interactions and diffusion, from which potential energy and diffusivity profiles were derived. The potential energy profile was analyzed and simulated by considering electrostatic, gravitational, and tethered forces, while the diffusivity was compared to that of a solid particle-boundary interaction, inclusive of hydrodynamic forces. The diffusivity was represented as a normalized diffusion coefficient to eliminate the impact of fluid viscosity. The normalized diffusion coefficient of polymer-shell microcapsules (0.02) was found to be an order of magnitude smaller than that of solid polystyrene particles (0.2). The microcapsule sampled a potential well consisting of two distinct minima, as observed experimentally and supported by analytical expressions and Brownian dynamics simulations. A critical tethered height (49.8 nm) and the alginate radius of (35.2 nm) were obtained from fitting our model to experimental data. This work concludes that these benign core shell microcapsules interact with a nearby boundary via a transient tethering interaction, overall producing a mild sticky interaction that would likely be beneficial for applications in consumer products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13227v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsic exchange bias is known as the unidirectional exchange anisotropy that emerges in a nominally single-component ferro-(ferri-)magnetic system. In this work, with magnetic and structural characterizations, we demonstrate that intrinsic exchange bias is a general phenomenon in (Ni, Co, Fe)-based spinel oxide films deposited on {\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) substrates, due to the emergence of a rock-salt interfacial layer consisting of antiferromagnetic CoO from interfacial reconstruction. We show that in NixCoyFe3-x-yO4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) films, intrinsic exchange bias and interfacial reconstruction have consistent dependences on Co concentration y, while the Ni and Fe concentration appears to be less important. This work establishes a family of intrinsic exchange bias materials with great tunability by stoichiometry and highlights the strategy of interface engineering in controlling material functionalities.</description>

Abstract: We present a first-principle numerical study of charge transport in a realistic two-dimensional tight-binding model of organic molecular semiconductors. We use the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm to simulate the full quantum dynamics of phonons and either a single or multiple charge carriers without any tunable parameters. We introduce a number of algorithmic improvements, including efficient Metropolis updates for phonon fields based on analytic insights, which lead to negligible autocorrelation times and allow to reach sub-permille precisions at small computational cost of $O(1)$ CPU-hour. Our simulations produce charge mobility estimates that are in good agreement with experiment and that also justify the phenomenological Transient Localisation approach.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Hydrogen Storage Capacities in Metal Hydrides: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17587v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a sophisticated hybrid machine-learning framework that significantly improves the accuracy of predicting hydrogen storage capacities in metal hydrides. This is a critical challenge due to the scarcity of experimental data and the complexity of high-dimensional feature spaces. Our approach employs the power of unsupervised learning through the use of a state-of-the-art autoencoder. This autoencoder is trained on elemental descriptors obtained from Mendeleev software, enabling the extraction of a meaningful and lower dimensional latent space from the input data. This latent representation serves as the basis for our deep multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, which consists of five layers and shows good precision in predicting hydrogen storage capacities. Furthermore, our results show very good agreement with the results of density functional theory (DFT). In addition to addressing the limitations caused by limited and unevenly distributed data in the field of hydrogen storage materials, we also focus on discovering new materials that show promising opportunities for hydrogen storage. These materials were identified using both feature-based approaches and predictions generated by a large language model. Finally, our investigation into the effectiveness of transferring weights from the autoencoder to the MLP, in addition to the latent features, suggests that while this strategy slightly improves model performance indicated by a slightly higher R$^2$ value and lower RMSE, it emphasizes the intricate challenge of adapting pre-trained weights for specific supervised tasks.</description>

Abstract: CdTe and its alloy CdTeSe are widely used in optoelectronic devices, such as radiation detectors and solar cells, due to their superior electrical properties. However, the formation of defects and defect complexes in these materials can significantly affect their performance. As a result, understanding the defect formation and recombination processes in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy is of great importance. In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the properties of defects in semiconductors. In this paper, we use DFT+U calculations to comprehensively study the properties of intrinsic defects as well as extrinsic defects induced by commonly used dopants, such as Cu and group V elements, in CdTe and CdTeSe alloy. This work provides insights into the effects of these defects on the electrical and optical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Atomistic theory of twist-angle dependent intralayer and interlayer exciton properties in twisted bilayer materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform to study and engineer properties of excitons. However, the atomistic description of these properties has remained a significant challenge as a consequence of the large unit cells of the emergent moir\'e superlattices. To address this problem, we introduce an efficient approach to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation that exploits the localization of atomic Wannier functions. We then use this approach to study intra- and interlayer excitons in twisted WS$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ at a range of twist angles. In agreement with experiment, we find that the optical spectrum exhibits three low-energy peaks for twist angles small than $2^\circ$. The energy splitting between the peaks is described accurately. We also find two low-energy interlayer excitons with weak oscillator strengths. Our approach opens up new opportunities for the design of light-matter interactions in ultrathin materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetization nutation in magnetic semiconductors: Effective spin model with anisotropic RKKY exchange interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the magnetization in magnetic semiconductors exhibits nutational motion when subjected to an external magnetic field. This behavior originates from the splitting of the conduction-electron band which induces anisotropic, distance-dependent exchange coupling between localized spins.
  To investigate this phenomenon, we examine a general system that includes both charge and spin degrees of freedom, characteristic of a magnetic semiconductor. This system is composed of two subsystems: (1) a gas of noninteracting conduction electrons and (2) a ferromagnetic array of localized spins, coupled through the Vonsovskii (\textit{sd}) local interaction. The entire system is subject to external electrical and magnetic disturbances. Through the Feynman-Schwinger formalism, we integrate out the faster (Grassmann) charge degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins in the form of an XXZ spin model. We then provide general analytical formulas for the corresponding anisotropic exchange couplings, expressed in Fourier and direct spaces, as functions of the effective field that induces conduction-band splitting.
  ....
  We hope this study will motivate further research into nutational phenomena in magnetic semiconductors, possibly resulting in improvements in the accurate control of magnetization dynamics within spin-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping</title>

Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</description>

      <title>Kagome bands and magnetism in MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome lattices facilitate various quantum phases, yet in bulk materials, their kagome flat-bands often interact with bulk bands, suppressing kagome electronic characteristics for hosting these phases. Here, we use density-functional-theory calculations to predict the geometric and electronic structures, as well as the topological and magnetic properties, of a series of MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers formed by mirror-twin-boundary (MTB) loops. We analyze ten MTB-loop configurations of varying sizes and arrangements to assess their impact on various properties. Within the intrinsic bandgap of MoTe$_{2}$, we identify two sets of kagome bands, primarily originating from in-plane and out-of-plane Mo d-orbitals at MTB-loop edges and -vertices, respectively. Three configurations exhibit superior stability, while three others show comparable stability. Among these, four display bandgaps and potentially non-zero Z$_{2}$ topological invariants, suggesting possible topological phases, while the remaining two are metallic and feature Stoner magnetization. These findings guide the design of kagome-based two-dimensional materials with tunable electronic, topological, and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>GdAlSi: An antiferromagnetic topological Weyl semimetal with non-relativistic spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional electronics based technologies in the past few decades. While on one hand, the discovery of topological phases of matter with protected spin-polarized states has opened up exciting prospects, recent revelation of intriguing non-relativistic spin splitting in collinear antiferromagnetic materials with unique symmetries facilitate a wide possibility of realizing both these features simultaneously. In this work, we report the co-existence of these two intriguing properties within a single material: GdAlSi. It crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal structure with a non-centrosymmetric space group $I4_{1}md$ ($109$), which is confirmed using detailed structural analysis through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. The magnetization data indicates AFM ordering with an ordering temperature ($T_N$) $\sim$ 32 K. Ab-initio calculations reveal GdAlSi to be a collinear antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal with an unconventional, momentum-dependent spin splitting, also referred to as altermagnet. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on GdAlSi single crystals subsequently confirm the presence of Fermi arcs, a distinctive hallmark of Weyl semimetals. Electric and magnetic multipole analysis provides a deeper understanding of the symmetry-mediated, momentum-dependent spin splitting, which has strictly non-relativistic origin. To the best of our knowledge, such co-existence of unconventional antiferromagnetic order and non-trivial topology is unprecedented and has never been observed before in a single material, rendering GdAlSi a special and promising candidate material. We propose a device harnessing these features, poised to enable practical and efficient topotronic applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic pressure control of the spin-orbit proximity effect, spin relaxation, and thermoelectricity in a phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06097</link>

Abstract: Effective control of interlayer interactions is a key element in modifying the properties of van der Waals heterostructures and the next step toward their practical applications. Focusing on the phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure, we demonstrate, using first-principles calculations, proximity-induced amplification of the spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene by applying vertical pressure. We simulate external pressure by changing the interlayer distance between bilayer constituents and show that it is possible to tune the spin-orbit field of phosphorene holes in a controllable way. By fitting effective electronic states of the proposed Hamiltonian to the first principles data, we reveal that the spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene hole bands is enhanced more than two times for experimentally accessible pressures up to 17 kbar. Correspondingly, we find that the pressure-enhanced spin-orbit coupling boosts the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism, reducing the spin lifetime of phosphorene holes by factor 4. We further explore the role of the lateral shift on the spin-orbit field and reveal that the spin-orbit strength of phosphorene holes can be sizably modulated when strong pressure is applied. We also found that the thermopower is governed mainly by the phosphorene and pressure reduces the overall thermoelectric efficiency of the heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Dependent Van Hove Singularity Shifts in Three-Dimensional Charge Density Waves of Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vanadium-based kagome systems AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have emerged as paradigmatic examples exhibiting unconventional charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity linked to van Hove singularities (VHSs). Despite extensive studies, the three-dimensional (3D) nature of CDW states in these systems remains elusive. This study employs first-principles density functional theory and a tight-binding model to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic structures of 3D CDWs in AV$_3$Sb$_5$, emphasizing the significant role of interlayer coupling in behaviors of the VHSs associated with diverse 3D CDW orders. We develop a minimal 3D tight-binding model and present a detailed analysis of band structures and density of states for various 3D CDW stacking configurations, including those with and without a $\pi$-phase shift stacking of the inverse star of David, as well as alternating stacking of the inverse star of David and the star of David. We find that VHSs exist below the Fermi level even in 3D CDWs without $\pi$-phase shift stackings, and that these VHSs shift downward in the $\pi$-phase shift stacking CDW structure, stabilizing the $2\times2\times2$ $\pi$-shifted inverse star of David distortions in alternating vanadium layers as the ground state 3D CDW order of AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our work provides the electronic origin of 3D CDW orders, paving the way for a deeper understanding of CDWs and superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals.</description>
