      <title>mcdust: A 2D Monte Carlo code for dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: mcdust is a parallel simulation code for dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. The code is written in FORTRAN90 and parallelised with OpenMP. The code models dust collisional evolution and transport in the vertical and radial directions. The currently included collisional outcomes are dust growth by sticking, fragmentation of dust particles and erosion, where a small particle chips a portion of the large particle. We employ a representative particle approach to track a limited number of particles instead of tracking every particle, saving computational time. We have a static power-law gas disk with temperature assumed to be vertically isothermal. Dust coagulation depends on the local gas properties, and therefore, we bin particles into grids and perform collisions. We make use of an adaptive grid approach where we make sure that each cell has an equal number of representative particles. This guarantees that there are always sufficient particles to resolve the physics of collisions. The code resolves dust coagulation in 2D(r-z).

      <title>Generative imaging for radio interferometry with fast uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature, necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so. Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification. Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net) architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Geant4 simulations for the COSI Anticoincidence System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer satellite mission, designed for all-sky observations in the soft gamma-ray domain with the use of germanium detectors (GeDs). An active Anticoincidence System (ACS) of BGO scintillators surrounds the GeDs to reduce the background and contribute to the detection of transient events. Accurately modeling the ACS performance requires simulating the intricate scintillation processes within the shields, which significantly increases the computational cost. We have encoded these effects into a correction matrix derived from dedicated Geant4 simulations with the inclusion of the optical physics. For this purpose, we use laboratory measurements for the energy and spatial response of the ACS lateral wall to benchmark the simulation and define instrument parameters, including the BGO absorption length and the electronic noise. We demonstrate that the simulations replicate the experimental energy resolution and light collection uniformity along the BGO crystal, with maximum discrepancies of 20% and 10%, respectively. The validated simulations are then used to develop the correction matrix for the lateral wall, accounting for the light collection efficiency and energy resolution based on the position within the crystal. The gamma-ray quantum detection efficiency is also position-dependent via the inclusion of the optical physics. It is enhanced by $\sim$8% close to the SiPMs and suppressed by $\sim$2% in the adjacent corners with respect to the average value. Finally, we explore the energy threshold and resolution of the bottom ACS, considering the impact of its smaller crystals compared with the lateral walls.</description>

      <title>How many pixels are there in a polarized pulsar timing array map?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\'e sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of gamma-ray response of the AstroPix4 HV-CMOS active pixel sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AstroPix is a novel high-voltage CMOS active pixel sensor being developed for a next generation gamma-ray space telescope, AMEGO-X. To meet AMEGO-X instrument requirements, AstroPix must achieve full depletion of its $500~\rm{\mu m}$ thick, $500~\rm{\mu m}$-pitch pixels. It must be sensitive to gamma rays in the range of $25-700$ keV, with the energy resolution at 122 keV of $&lt;10$%. Furthermore, given the space-based nature of AMEGO-X, the power consumption of AstroPix needs to be lower than $1.5~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$. We report the gamma-ray response of the latest version of AstroPix, AstroPix4. The chip contains $16\times 13$ array of $500~\rm{\mu m}$-pitch pixels. The power consumption is estimated to be about $2~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$, which is approximately half the power of the previous AstroPix version. The input capacitance is reduced, allowing for the detection of the 14 keV photopeak from $\rm{^{57}Co}$ and a moderate energy resolution of 14% at 122 keV. The dynamic range is estimated to be in the range from 14 keV to $\sim250$ keV. We found that the sensor depletion layer expands as expected and the measured depletion depth is approximately $90~\rm{\mu m}$ when biased at $-240$ V.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic cosmological inference on HI tomographic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of retrieving cosmological information from 21-cm tomographic data at intermediate redshift. The first step in our approach consists of training an encoder, composed of several three dimensional convolutional layers, to cast the neutral hydrogen 3D data into a lower dimension latent space. Once pre-trained, the featurizer is able to generate 3D grid representations which, in turn, will be mapped onto cosmology ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_{8}$) via likelihood-free inference. For the latter, which is framed as a density estimation problem, we consider a Bayesian approximation method which exploits the capacity of Masked Autoregressive Flow to estimate the posterior. It is found that the representations learned by the deep encoder are separable in latent space. Results show that the neural density estimator, trained on the latent codes, is able to constrain cosmology with a precision of $R^2 \ge 0.91$ on all parameters and that most of the ground truth of the instances in the test set fall within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. It is established that the posterior uncertainty from the density estimator is reasonably calibrated. We also investigate the robustness of the feature extractor by using it to compress out-of-distribution dataset, that is either from a different simulation or from the same simulation but at different redshift. We find that, while trained on the latent codes corresponding to different types of out-of-distribution dataset, the probabilistic model is still reasonably capable of constraining cosmology, with $R^2 \ge 0.80$ in general. This highlights both the predictive power of the density estimator considered in this work and the meaningfulness of the latent codes retrieved by the encoder. We believe that the approach prescribed in this proof of concept will be of great use when analyzing 21-cm data from various surveys in the near future.</description>

      <title>Nighttime Cloud Detection, Tracking and Prediction with All-Sky Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for real-time nighttime cloud detection, tracking, and prediction using all-sky cameras, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of ground-based robotic telescopes. Ground-based telescopes are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, particularly cloud cover, which can lead to the loss of valuable observation time and potential damage to the telescope. Existing methods for cloud detection have limitations in accuracy, particularly under varying illumination conditions such as gibbous moon phases. To address these challenges, we developed an algorithm that uses the temporal incoherence of image sequences from all-sky cameras. The method computes difference images to highlight moving cloud structures, applies Otsu thresholding to generate binary cloud maps, and uses mathematical morphology techniques to reduce noise from bright stars and other artifacts. Segmented cloud regions are then tracked across successive frames, allowing estimation of a velocity vector and enabling short-term predictions of cloud movement. Our approach achieves reliable cloud detection and tracking, providing predictions up to 15 minutes into the future - a capability critical for robotic telescopes that rely on look-ahead scheduling. The system was validated against extensive historical data from the Liverpool Telescope's Skycam A and T systems, achieving a false positive rate of approximately 1% and a similar false negative rate, depending on cloud thickness and speed. By improving cloud forecasting and observational scheduling, the system offers a valuable tool for enhancing the operational reliability of robotic telescopes.</description>

      <title>NIRPS joining HARPS at ESO 3.6 m. On-sky performance and science objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) is a high-resolution, high-stability near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph equipped with an AO system. Installed on the ESO 3.6-m telescope, it was developed to enable radial velocity (RV) measurements of low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs and to characterise exoplanet atmospheres in the NIR. This paper provides a comprehensive design overview and characterisation of the NIRPS instrument, reporting on its on-sky performance, and presenting its GTO programme. The instrument started its operations on 1 Apr 2023 after intensive on-sky testing phases. The spectral range continuously covers the Y, J, and H bands from 972.4 to 1919.6 nm. The thermal control system maintains 1 mK stability over several months. The NIRPS AO-assisted fibre link improves coupling efficiency and offers a unique high-angular resolution capability with a fibre acceptance of only 0.4 arcsec. A high spectral resolving power of 90 000 and 75 000 is provided in HA and HE modes, respectively. The overall throughput from the top of the atmosphere to the detector peaks at 13 percent. The RV precision, measured on the bright star Proxima with a known exoplanetary system, is 77 cm/s. NIRPS and HARPS can be used simultaneously, offering unprecedented spectral coverage for spectroscopic characterisation and stellar activity mitigation. Modal noise can be aptly mitigated by the implementation of fibre stretchers and AO scanning mode. Initial results confirm that NIRPS opens new possibilities for RV measurements, stellar characterisation, and exoplanet atmosphere studies with high precision and high spectral fidelity. NIRPS demonstrated stable RV precision at the level of 1 m/s over several weeks. The instrument high throughput offers a notable improvement over previous spectrographs, enhancing our ability to detect small exoplanets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance of $53.56(\pm 0.45)$ million ${\rm km}$ ($0.358\pm 0.003$~au) from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. We show that applying a total thrust $\Delta$V of $2.6755{{\rm km~s^{-1}}}$ to lower perijove on September 9, 2025 and then execute a Jupiter Oberth Maneuver, can bring the Juno spacecraft from its orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026. A close fly-by might be able to probe the nature of 3I/ATLAS far better than telescopes on Earth.</description>

      <title>Explaining the "too massive" high-redshift galaxies in JWST data: numerical study of three effects and a simple relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as $M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope $\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, $\epsilon(\alpha) \approx \epsilon_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(\alpha -2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Requirements for Joint Orbital Characterization of Cold Giants and Habitable Worlds with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine optimal requirements for the joint detection of habitable-zone planets and cold giant planets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Analysis of 164 nearby stars shows that a coronagraph outer working angle (OWA) of 1440 milliarcseconds (mas) is necessary to achieve 80-90% visibility of cold giants. Approximately 40 precursor radial velocity measurements with 1 m/s precision are required to adequately constrain orbital parameters before HWO observations. We demonstrate that 6-8 astrometric measurements distributed across the mission timeline, compared to radial velocity constraints alone and to astrometry constraints alone, significantly improve orbital parameter precision, enabling direct determination of orbital inclination with uncertainties of 0.8-3 degrees. For habitable-zone planet characterization, 4-5 epochs provide moderate confidence, while high-confidence (95%) confirmation requires 8+ observations. These specifications are essential for the comprehensive characterization of planetary system architectures and understanding the potential habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Sun sensor calibration algorithms: A systematic mapping and survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21541</link>

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun sensor modeling and calibration techniques.</description>

      <title>Diving into the planetary system of Proxima with NIRPS -- Breaking the metre per second barrier in the infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtained 420 high-resolution spectra of Proxima, over 159 nights, using the Near Infra Red Planet Searcher (NIRPS). We derived 149 nightly binned radial velocity measurements with a standard deviation of 1.69 m/s and a median uncertainty of 55 cm/s, and performed a joint analysis combining radial velocities, spectroscopic activity indicators, and ground-based photometry, to model the planetary and stellar signals present in the data, applying multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression to model the activity signals. We detect the radial velocity signal of Proxima b in the NIRPS data. All planetary characteristics are consistent with those previously derived using visible light spectrographs. In addition, we find evidence of the presence of the sub-Earth Proxima d in the NIRPS data. When combining the data with the HARPS observations taken simultaneous to NIRPS, we obtain a tentative detection of Proxima d and parameters consistent with those measured with ESPRESSO. By combining the NIRPS data with simultaneously obtained HARPS observations and archival data, we confirm the existence of Proxima d, and demonstrate that its parameters are stable over time and against change of instrument. We refine the planetary parameters of Proxima b and d, and find inconclusive evidence of the signal attributed to Proxima c (P = 1900 d) being present in the data. We measure Proxima b and d to have minimum masses of 1.055 $\pm$ 0.055 Me, and 0.260 $\pm$ 0.038 Me, respectively. Our results show that, in the case of Proxima, NIRPS provides more precise radial velocity data than HARPS, and a more significant detection of the planetary signals. The standard deviation of the residuals of NIRPS after the fit is 80 cm/s, showcasing the potential of NIRPS to measure precise radial velocities in the near-infrared.</description>

      <title>Properties and approximations of a Bessel distribution for data science applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents properties and approximations of a random variable based on the zero-order modified Bessel function that results from the compounding of a zero-mean Gaussian with a $\chi^2_1$-distributed variance. This family of distributions is a special case of the McKay family of Bessel distributions and of a family of generalized Laplace distributions. It is found that the Bessel distribution can be approximated with a null-location Laplace distribution, which corresponds to the compounding of a zero-mean Gaussian with a $\chi^2_2$-distributed variance. Other useful properties and representations of the Bessel distribution are discussed, including a closed form for the cumulative distribution function that makes use of the modified Struve functions. Another approximation of the Bessel distribution that is based on an empirical power-series approximation is also presented. The approximations are tested with the application to the typical problem of statistical hypothesis testing. It is found that a Laplace distribution of suitable scale parameter can approximate quantiles of the Bessel distribution with better than 10% accuracy, with the computational advantage associated with the use of simple elementary functions instead of special functions. It is expected that the approximations proposed in this paper be useful for a variety of data science applications where analytic simplicity and computational efficiency are of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>An automated method for finding the most distant quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys such as Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (Roman) will detect hundreds of high-redshift (z &gt; 7) quasars, but distinguishing them from the billions of other sources in these catalogues represents a significant data analysis challenge. We address this problem by extending existing selection methods by using both i) Bayesian model comparison on measured fluxes and ii) a likelihood-based goodness-of-fit test on images, which are then combined using the F_beta statistic (where beta is a parameter which can be tuned to prioritise completeness). The result is an automated, reproduceable and objective high-redshift quasar selection pipeline. We test this on both simulations and real data from the cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) catalogues. On this cross-matched dataset we achieve an area under the curve (AUC) score of up to 0.81 and an F_3 score of up to 0.79; or, if the completeness is fixed to be 0.9, then we can obtain an efficiency of 0.15. This is sufficient to be applied to the Euclid, LSST and Roman data when available.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency and Low-Noise Detectors for the Upgraded CLASS 90 GHz Focal Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the in-lab and on-sky performance for the upgraded 90 GHz focal plane of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), which had four of its seven detector wafers updated during the austral winter of 2022. The update aimed to improve the transition-edge-sensor (TES) stability and bias range and to realize the high optical efficiency of the sensor design. Modifications included revised circuit terminations, electrical contact between the TES superconductor and the normal metal providing the bulk of the bolometer's heat capacity, and additional filtering on the TES bias lines. The upgrade was successful: 94% of detectors are stable down to 15% of the normal resistance, providing a wide overlapping range of bias voltages for all TESs on a wafer. The median telescope efficiency improved from $0.42^{+0.15}_{-0.22}$ to $0.60^{+0.10}_{-0.32}$ (68% quantiles). For the four upgraded wafers alone, median telescope efficiency increased to $0.65^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. Given our efficiency estimate for the receiver optics, this telescope efficiency implies a detector efficiency exceeding $0.90$. The overall noise-equivalent temperature of the 90 GHz focal plane improved from 19 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ to 9.7 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis is a crucial methodology in astrophysics, enabling the interpretation of the integrated light of galaxies and stellar clusters. By combining empirical and/or theoretical libraries of the spectral energy distribution emitted by simple stellar populations (SSPs) with models of the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution, population synthesis facilitates the estimation of essential galaxy properties, such as total stellar mass, star formation rate, mass-weighted age and metallicity, etc. The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) is a Python library that offers a comprehensive and flexible framework for stellar population synthesis. Its main goal is to compute composite spectra using different galaxy evolution models and SSP libraries with ease and efficiency. It incorporates additional effects, such as cosmic redshift and dust extinction, and it computes several observable quantities derived from the spectra, including broadband photometric fluxes and equivalent widths.</description>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1) in advance of the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will enable boundless discoveries in time-domain astronomy over the next ten years. DP1 provides an ideal sandbox for validating innovative data analysis approaches for the LSST mission, whose scale challenges established software infrastructure paradigms. This note presents a pair of such pipelines for variability-finding using powerful software infrastructure suited to LSST data, namely the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and the LSDB framework, developed by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. This article presents a pair of variability-finding pipelines built on LSDB, the HATS catalog of DP1 data, and preliminary results of detected variable objects, two of which are novel discoveries.</description>

      <title>The Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC): A nulling coronagraph for use on primary objective grating telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC), a novel variation of the Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph (AIC) that is designed for optical systems featuring large, dispersive primary objective gratings. DLC was originally designed for the Diffractive Interfero Coronagraph Exoplanet Resolver (DICER), a notional 20m class infrared space telescope utilizing the enhanced one-dimensional angular resolution of large diffraction gratings in order to discover and characterize near-Earth exoplanets. Here we develop the theoretical foundation for DLC, and apply it to DICER as an example use case. We derive important properties of the DLC system including focal plane transmission maps, stellar leakage, residual optical path difference tolerance, and pointing error/jitter considerations. Ultimately, we found that DLC effectively nulls an on-axis target across the entire spectrum in the focal plane, allowing for 2D/lambda diffraction-limited imaging. It requires asymmetrical fine-guidance tolerances on pointing error/jitter. We work through a benchmark DICER design, explaining the need for a second disperser to reduce background from Zodiacal light, and showing that it could plausibly find and characterize approximately 4 nearby, habitable exoplanets around Sun-like stars in a seven year mission; about 30% of the habitable exoplanets within 8 pc were found in our simulation. The DLC may be useful for any application requiring extremely high resolution, close-companion spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>

      <title>A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>

Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>

      <title>dot-PE: Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>

      <title>LensingFlow: An Automated Workflow for Gravitational Wave Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.</description>
