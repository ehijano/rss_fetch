      <title>Optimizing Phase-Scheduling with Throughput Trade-offs in AQFP Digital Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) logic is a promising emerging superconducting technology for ultra-low power digital circuits, offering orders of magnitude lower power consumption than CMOS. However, AQFP scalability is challenged by excessive buffer overhead due to path balancing technology constraints. Addressing this, recent AQFP works have proposed design solutions to reduce path balancing overhead using phase-skipping and phase-alignment. Phase-skipping is a circuit-level technique that allows data transfer between AQFP gates clocked with non-consecutive clock phases. In contrast, phase-alignment is an architectural approach involving repeating input patterns to allow data transfer between AQFP gates across multiples of full clock cycles. While both techniques individually mitigate the area overhead of path-balancing, they have not yet been jointly explored. In this work, we present the first clock phase scheduling algorithm that combines phase-skipping and phase-alignment. We first present a minimum area method that on average, achieves a 25% area reduction compared to phase-skipping alone and a 11% reduction compared to phase-alignment. We then extend the method to enforce a target throughput, enabling efficient area-performance trade-offs. With our throughput constrained optimization, we achieve on average 6.8% area savings with a 2.62x increased throughput compared to the state-of-the-art phase-aligned method.</description>

      <title>CMOS 2.0 - Redefining the Future of Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to revisit the functional scaling paradigm by capitalizing on two recent developments in advanced chip manufacturing, namely 3D wafer bonding and backside processing. This approach leads to the proposal of the CMOS 2.0 platform. The main idea is to shift the CMOS roadmap from geometric scaling to fine-grain heterogeneous 3D stacking of specialized active device layers to achieve the ultimate Power-Performance-Area and Cost gains expected from future technology generations. However, the efficient utilization of such a platform requires devising architectures that can optimally map onto this technology, as well as the EDA infrastructure that supports it. We also discuss reliability concerns and eventual mitigation approaches. This paper provides pointers into the major disruptions we expect in the design of systems in CMOS 2.0 moving forward.</description>

      <title>Learned Display Radiance Fields with Lensless Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrating displays is a basic and regular task that content creators must perform to maintain optimal visual experience, yet it remains a troublesome issue. Measuring display characteristics from different viewpoints often requires specialized equipment and a dark room, making it inaccessible to most users. To avoid specialized hardware requirements in display calibrations, our work co-designs a lensless camera and an Implicit Neural Representation based algorithm for capturing display characteristics from various viewpoints. More specifically, our pipeline enables efficient reconstruction of light fields emitted from a display from a viewing cone of 46.6{\deg} X 37.6{\deg}. Our emerging pipeline paves the initial steps towards effortless display calibration and characterization.</description>

      <title>Deep vs. Shallow: Benchmarking Physics-Informed Neural Architectures on the Biharmonic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers are fundamental to engineering simulation. Classical mesh-based approaches (finite difference/volume/element) are fast and accurate on high-quality meshes but struggle with higher-order operators and complex, hard-to-mesh geometries. Recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants are mesh-free and flexible, yet compute-intensive and often less accurate. This paper systematically benchmarks RBF-PIELM, a rapid PINN variant-an extreme learning machine with radial-basis activations-for higher-order PDEs. RBF-PIELM replaces PINNs' time-consuming gradient descent with a single-shot least-squares solve. We test RBF-PIELM on the fourth-order biharmonic equation using two benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flow (streamfunction formulation) and a manufactured oscillatory solution. Our results show up to $(350\times)$ faster training than PINNs and over $(10\times)$ fewer parameters for comparable solution accuracy. Despite surpassing PINNs, RBF-PIELM still lags mature mesh-based solvers and its accuracy degrades on highly oscillatory solutions, highlighting remaining challenges for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Approximate Full Adders Applying Memristive Serial IMPLY Logic For Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers and designers are facing problems with memory and power walls, considering the pervasiveness of Von-Neumann architecture in the design of processors and the problems caused by reducing the dimensions of deep sub-micron transistors. Memristive Approximate Computing (AC) and In-Memory Processing (IMP) can be promising solutions to these problems. We have tried to solve the power and memory wall problems by presenting the implementation algorithm of four memristive approximate full adders applying the Material Implication (IMPLY) method. The proposed circuits reduce the number of computational steps by up to 40% compared to the state-of-the-art. The energy consumption of the proposed circuits improves over the previous exact ones by 49%-75% and over the approximate full adders by up to 41%. Multiple error evaluation criteria evaluate the computational accuracy of the proposed approximate full adders in three scenarios in the 8-bit approximate adder structure. The proposed approximate full adders are evaluated in three image processing applications in three scenarios. The results of application-level simulation indicate that the four proposed circuits can be applied in all three scenarios, considering the acceptable image quality metrics of the output images.</description>

      <title>Optimizing compilation of error correction codes for 2xN quantum dot arrays and its NP-hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays</description>

      <title>On the Reliability of Information Retrieval From MDS Coded Data in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical analysis of the probability of successfully retrieving data encoded with MDS codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes) in DNA storage systems. We study this probability under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) substitution errors, focusing on a common code design strategy that combines inner and outer MDS codes. Our analysis demonstrates how this probability depends on factors such as the total number of sequencing reads, their distribution across strands, the rates of the inner and outer codes, and the substitution error probabilities. These results provide actionable insights into optimizing DNA storage systems under reliability constraints, including determining the minimum number of sequencing reads needed for reliable data retrieval and identifying the optimal balance between the rates of inner and outer MDS codes.</description>

      <title>MURMR: A Multimodal Sensing Framework for Automated Group Behavior Analysis in Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaboration is at the heart of many complex tasks, and mixed reality (MR) offers a powerful new medium to support it. Understanding how teams coordinate in immersive environments is critical for designing effective MR applications that support collaborative work. However, existing methods rely on external observation systems and manual annotation, lacking deployable solutions for capturing temporal collaboration dynamics. We present MURMR, a system with two complementary modules that passively analyze multimodal interaction data from commodity MR headsets. Our structural analysis module constructs automated sociograms revealing group organization and roles, while our temporal analysis module performs unsupervised clustering to identify moment-to-moment dyad behavior patterns. Through a 48-participant study with egocentric video validation, we demonstrate that the structural module captures stable interaction patterns while the temporal module reveals substantial behavioral variability that session-level approaches miss. This dual-module architecture advances collaboration research by establishing that structural and temporal dynamics require separate analytical approaches, enabling both real-time group monitoring and detailed behavioral understanding in immersive collaborative environments.</description>

      <title>A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization.
  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</description>
