      <title>Congestion transition on random walks on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The congestion formation on a urban road network is one of the key issue for the development of a sustainable mobility in the future smart cities. In this work we propose a reductionist approach studying the stationary states of a simple transport model using of a random process on a graph, where each node represents a location and the weight links give the transition rates to move from one node to another that represent the mobility demand. Each node has a finite transport capacity and a maximum load capacity and we assume that the average. In the approximation of the single step process we are able to analytically characterize the traffic load distribution on the single nodes, using a local Maximum Entropy Principle. Our results explain how the congested nodes emerge when the total traffic load increases in analogous way to a percolation transition where the appearance of a congested node is a independent random event, However, using numerical simulations, we show that in the more realistic case of the synchronous dynamics for the nodes, there are entropic forces that introduce correlation among the node state and favor the clustering of the empty and congested nodes. Our aim is to highlight universal properties of the congestion formation and, in particular, to understand the role traffic load fluctuations as a possible precursor of congestion in a transport network.</description>

      <title>Chasing the eternal sun: Does a global super grid favor the deployment of solar power?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative advocates the development of a global Super grid for sharing renewable energy, especially solar energy. This study evaluates the economic benefits of such a Super grid, which connects six large regions spanning from Australia to the US, utilizing a detailed energy system optimization model and considering heterogeneous discount rates among countries. Integrating the six regions into a Super grid reduces the electricity system cost by 3.8% compared to isolating them. In contrast, grid expansion within each region reduces the electricity system cost by 12% on average. The economic benefits of the OSOWOG initiative's global Super grid expansion seem to be rather limited. Moreover, the allowance for a Super grid consistently results in decreased investments in solar power, indicating that it is not an effective strategy for enhancing the deployment of solar power, even when transmission grids covering 18 time zones are available.</description>

      <title>Rebound in epidemic control: How misaligned vaccination timing amplifies infection peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamic interplay between the timing of vaccination campaigns and the trajectory of disease spread in a population. Through comprehensive data analysis and modeling, we have uncovered a counter-intuitive phenomenon: initiating a vaccination process at an inopportune moment can paradoxically result in a more pronounced second peak of infections. This "rebound" phenomenon challenges the conventional understanding of vaccination impacts on epidemic dynamics. We provide a detailed examination of how improperly timed vaccination efforts can inadvertently reduce the overall immunity level in a population, considering both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Our findings reveal that such a decrease in population-wide immunity can lead to a delayed, yet more severe, resurgence of cases. This study not only adds a critical dimension to our understanding of vaccination strategies in controlling pandemics but also underscores the necessity for strategically timed interventions to optimize public health outcomes. Furthermore, we compute which vaccination strategies are optimal for a COVID-19 tailored mathematical model, and find that there are two types of optimal strategies. The first type prioritizes vaccinating early and rapidly to reduce the number of deaths, while the second type acts later and more slowly to reduce the number of cases; both of them target primarily the elderly population. Our results hold significant implications for the formulation of vaccination policies, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Suppressing defection by increasing temptation: the impact of smart cooperators on a social dilemma situation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a social dilemma situation, where individual and collective interests are in conflict, it sounds a reasonable assumption that the presence of super or smart players, who simultaneously punish defection and reward cooperation without allowing exploitation, could solve the basic problem. The behavior of such a multi-strategy system, however, is more subtle than it is firstly anticipated. When exploring the complete parameter space, we find that the emergence of cyclic dominance among strategies is rather common, which results in several counter-intuitive phenomena. For example, the defection level can be lowered at higher temptation, or weaker punishment provides better conditions for smart players. Our study indicates that smart cooperators can unexpectedly thrive under high temptation, emphasizing the complexity of strategic interactions. This study suggests that the principles governing these interactions can be applied to other moral behaviors, such as truth-telling and honesty, providing valuable insights for future research in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Proper Interpretation of Heaps' and Zipf's Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We checked that the distribution of words in text should uniform, which gives Heaps' law as natural result, that is, the number of types of words can be expressed as a power law of the number of tokens within text. We developed a ``superposition'' model, which leads to an asymptotic power-law distribution of the number of occurrences (or frequency) of words, that is, Zipf's law. The model is well consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Attrition in Science: A Cohort-Based, Longitudinal Study of Scientists in 38 OECD Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how members of the scientific community leave academic science and how attrition (defined as ceasing to publish) differs across genders, academic disciplines, and over time. Our approach is cohort based and longitudinal: We track individual male and female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally referred to as 'leaving science.' Using publication metadata from Scopus - a global bibliometric database of publications and citations - we follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N = 232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. Survival analyses show that attrition becomes less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in science means different things for men versus women depending on the discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in attrition.</description>

      <title>Initial Burst of Disruptive Efforts Ensuring Scientific Career Viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite persistent efforts to understand the dynamics of creativity of scientists over careers in terms of productivity, impact, and prize, little is known about the dynamics of scientists' disruptive efforts that affect individual academic careers and drive scientific advance. Drawing on millions of data over six decades and across nineteen disciplines, associating the publication records of individual scientists with the disruption index, we systematically quantify the temporal pattern of disruptive ideas over individual scientific careers, providing a detailed understanding of the macro phenomenon of scientific stagnation from the individual perspective. We start by checking the relationship between disruption-based and citation-based publication profiles. Next, we observe the finite inequality in the disruptive productivity of scientists, diminishing gradually as the level of disruption increases. We then identify the initial burst phenomenon in disruption dynamics. It is further revealed that while early engagement in high disruption frictions away initial productivity, compared to initial advantage in productivity or impact, initial high disruption ensures more subsequent academic viability evidenced by a longer career span and relatively final higher productivity, but does not necessarily guarantee academic success throughout careers. Further analysis shows that increasing disruptive work is uncorrelated to overall productivity but negatively correlated with the overall impact. However, increasing disruptive work in the early career is associated with higher overall productivity, yet lower overall productivity in the later career. Our research underscores the urgent need for a policy shift that encourages a balance between the pursuit of disruptive efforts and the achievement of impactful outcomes.</description>

      <title>Auditing citation polarization during the early COVID-19 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent pandemic stimulated scientists to publish a significant amount of research that created a surge of citations of COVID-19-related publications in a short time, leading to an abrupt inflation of the journal impact factor (IF). By auditing the complete set of COVID-19-related publications in the Web of Science, we reveal here that COVID-19-related research worsened the polarization of academic journals: the IF before the pandemic was proportional to the increment of IF, which had the effect of increasing inequality while retaining the journal rankings. We also found that the most highly cited studies related to COVID-19 were published in prestigious journals at the onset of the epidemic. Through the present quantitative investigation, our findings caution against the belief that quantitative metrics, particularly IF, can indicate the significance of individual papers. Rather, such metrics reflect the social attention given to a particular study.</description>

      <title>Improving Demand Forecasting in Open Systems with Cartogram-Enhanced Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting temporal patterns across various domains poses significant challenges due to their nuanced and often nonlinear trajectories. To address this challenge, prediction frameworks have been continuously refined, employing data-driven statistical methods, mathematical models, and machine learning. Recently, as one of the challenging systems, shared transport systems such as public bicycles have gained prominence due to urban constraints and environmental concerns. Predicting rental and return patterns at bicycle stations remains a formidable task due to the system's openness and imbalanced usage patterns across stations. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework to predict rental and return patterns by leveraging cartogram approaches. The cartogram approach facilitates the prediction of demand for newly installed stations with no training data as well as long-period prediction, which has not been achieved before. We apply this method to public bicycle rental-and-return data in Seoul, South Korea, employing a spatial-temporal convolutional graph attention network. Our improved architecture incorporates batch attention and modified node feature updates for better prediction accuracy across different time scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in predicting temporal patterns and its potential applications.</description>

      <title>Swap distance minimization beyond entropy minimization in word order variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we consider the problem of all the possible orders of a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate if the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. Here we present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization, and investigate the theoretical distribution of that score for any $n$: its minimum and maximum values and its expected value in die rolling experiments or when the word order frequencies are shuffled. We investigate whether entropy and average swap distance are significantly small in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$ in agreement with the corresponding minimization principles. We find strong evidence of entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment. The evidence of these two forces with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to minimize word order entropy.</description>
