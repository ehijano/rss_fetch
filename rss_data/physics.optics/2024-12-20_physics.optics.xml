      <title>Aspect ratio controls hot-carrier generation in gold nanobricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second-order sideband generation and slow-fast light via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate second-order sideband generation (SSG) and slow-fast light using a hybrid system comprised of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, namely a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, whereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</description>

      <title>Energy Consumption of GEO-to-ground Beaconless Link Acquisition Against Random Vibration with Coherent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GEO satellite maintains good synchronization with the ground, reducing the priority of acquisition time in the establishment of the optical link. Whereas energy is an important resource for the satellite to execute space missions, the consumption during the acquisition process rises to the primary optimization objective. However, no previous studies have addressed this issue. Motivated by this gap, this paper first model the relationship between the transmitted power and the received SNR in the coherent detection system, with the corresponding single-field acquisition probability, the acquisition time is then calculated, and the closed-form expression of the multi-field acquisition energy consumption is further derived in scan-stare mode. Then for dual-scan technique, through the induction of the probability density function of acquisition energy, it is transformed into the equivalent form of scan-stare, thereby acquiring acquisition energy. Subsequently, optimizations are performed on these two modes. The above theoretical derivations are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Consequently, the acquisition energy of dual-scan is lower than that of scan-stare, with the acquisition time being about half of the latter, making it a more efficient technique. Notably, the optimum beam divergence angle is the minimum that the laser can modulate, and the beaconless acquisition energy is only 6\% of that with the beacon, indicating that the beaconless is a better strategy for optical link acquisition with the goal of energy consumption optimization.</description>

      <title>Fast inverse lithography based on a model-driven block stacking convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of lithography, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a crucial resolution enhancement technique that optimizes the transmission function of photomasks on a pixel-based to effectively counter Optical Proximity Effects (OPE). However, conventional pixel-based OPC methods often generate patterns that pose manufacturing challenges, thereby leading to the increased cost in practical scenarios. This paper presents a novel inverse lithographic approach to OPC, employing a model-driven, block stacking deep learning framework that expedites the generation of masks conducive to manufacturing. This method is founded on vector lithography modelling and streamlines the training process by eliminating the requirement for extensive labeled datasets. Furthermore, diversity of mask patterns is enhanced by employing a wave function collapse algorithm, which facilitates the random generation of a multitude of target patterns, therefore significantly expanding the range of mask paradigm. Numerical experiments have substantiated the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end approach, highlighting its superior capability to manage mask complexity within the context of advanced OPC lithography. This advancement is anticipated to enhance the feasibility and economic viability of OPC technology within actual manufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>Passive silicon nitride integrated photonics for spatial intensity and phase sensing of visible light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase is an intrinsic property of light, and thus a crucial parameter across numerous applications in modern optics. Various methods exist for measuring the phase of light, each presenting challenges and limitations-from the mechanical stability requirements of free-space interferometers to the computational complexity usually associated with methods based on spatial light modulators. Here, we utilize a passive photonic integrated circuit to spatially probe phase and intensity distributions of free-space light beams. Phase information is encoded into intensity through a set of passive on-chip interferometers, allowing conventional detectors to retrieve the phase profile of light through single-shot intensity measurements. Furthermore, we use silicon nitride as material platform for the waveguide architecture, facilitating broadband utilization in the visible spectral range. Our approach for fast, broadband, and spatially resolved measurement of intensity and phase enables a wide variety of potential applications, ranging from microscopy to free-space optical communication.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable optical frequency dissemination over a branching passive optical network using CDMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a technique for ultrastable optical frequency dissemination in a branching passive optical network using code-division multiple access (CDMA). In our protocol, each network user employs a unique pseudo-random sequence to rapidly change the optical frequency among many distinct frequencies. After transmission through the optical network, each user correlates the received sequence with the transmitted one, thus establishing a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technique that helps reject optical signals transmitted by other users in the network. Our method, which builds on the work by Schediwy et al. [Opt. Lett. {\bf 38}, 2893 (2013)], improves the frequency distribution network's capacity, helps reject phase noise caused by intermediate optical back scattering, and simplifies the operational requirements. Using this protocol, we show that a frequency instability better than ~$10^{-18}$ while having more than 100 users operating in the network should be possible. Finally, we theoretically explore the limits of this protocol and show that the demonstrated stability does not suffer from any fundamental limitation. In the future, the CDMA method presented here could be used in complex time-frequency distribution networks, allowing more users while, at the same time, reducing the network's complexity.</description>

      <title>Centimetre-Scale Micro-Transfer Printing to enable Heterogeneous Integration of Thin Film Lithium Niobate with Silicon Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated photonics CMOS-compatible silicon nitride (SiN) platform is praised for its low propagation loss, but is limited by its lack of active functionalities such as a strong Pockels coefficient and intrinsic \c{hi}(2) nonlinearity. In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of centimetre-long thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices on a SiN platform using the micro-transfer printing (uTP) method. At a wavelength of 1550 nm, propagation losses of approximately 0.9 dB/cm and transition losses of 1.8 dB per facet were measured. Furthermore, the TFLN was integrated into an imbalanced push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, achieving a V{\pi} of 3.2 V. The electro-optics nature of the observed modulation is confirmed by measuring the device up to 35 GHz, showing that the printing does not affect the high-speed LN properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of extrinsic topological phases in Floquet photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Successive optimization of optics and post-processing with differentiable coherent PSF operator and field information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the joint design of optical systems and downstream algorithms is showing significant potential. However, existing rays-described methods are limited to optimizing geometric degradation, making it difficult to fully represent the optical characteristics of complex, miniaturized lenses constrained by wavefront aberration or diffraction effects. In this work, we introduce a precise optical simulation model, and every operation in pipeline is differentiable. This model employs a novel initial value strategy to enhance the reliability of intersection calculation on high aspherics. Moreover, it utilizes a differential operator to reduce memory consumption during coherent point spread function calculations. To efficiently address various degradation, we design a joint optimization procedure that leverages field information. Guided by a general restoration network, the proposed method not only enhances the image quality, but also successively improves the optical performance across multiple lenses that are already in professional level. This joint optimization pipeline offers innovative insights into the practical design of sophisticated optical systems and post-processing algorithms.

      <title>Revisiting Einstein's analogy: black holes as gradient-index lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to Albert Einstein, gravitation is analogous to an optical medium. Building on this idea, various definitions of the gradient-index (GRIN) medium representing curved spacetime have been proposed; often, these approaches demand advanced knowledge of General Relativity and its associated mathematical methods. This paper introduces a novel approach for generating the form of GRIN media that reproduces the behavior of light in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole or about the equatorial spacetime of a Kerr black hole. Our approach is based on Noether's theorem that leads to optical Fermat's principle, leveraging the system's symmetry, resulting in a general method for finding GRIN media in a flat spacetime that reproduces the behavior of light in Schwarzschild-like spacetimes where only using photon trajectories as input. This approach is also valid for material particles and provides a complementary understanding of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Rapid Assembly of Thousands of Defect-Free Neutral Atom Arrays with Constant-time-overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembling increasingly larger-scale defect-free optical tweezer-trapped atom arrays is essential for quantum computation and quantum simulations based on atoms. Here, we propose an AI-enabled, rapid, constant-time-overhead rearrangement protocol, and we experimentally assemble defect-free 2D and 3D atom arrays with up to 2024 atoms with a constant time cost of 60 ms. The AI model calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise controls over both position and phase, a high-speed spatial light modulator moves all the atoms simultaneously. This protocol can be readily used to generate defect-free arrays of tens of thousands of atoms with current technologies, and become a useful toolbox for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Dual Photonics Probing of Nano- to Submicron-Scale Structural Alterations in Human Brain Tissues or Cells and Chromatin or DNA with the Progression of Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding alterations in structural disorders in tissue or cells or building blocks, such as DNA or chromatin in the human brain, at the nano to submicron level provides us with efficient biomarkers for Alzheimers detection. Here, we report a dual photonics technique to detect nano- to submicron-scale alterations in brain tissues or cells and DNA or chromatin due to the early to late progression of Alzheimers disease in humans. Using a recently developed mesoscopic light transport technique, fine-focused nano-sensitive partial wave spectroscopy (PWS), we measure the degree of structural disorder in tissues. Furthermore, the chemical-specific inverse participation ratio technique (IPR) was used to measure the DNA or chromatin structural alterations. The results of the PWS and IPR experiments showed a significant increase in the degree of structural disorder at the nano to submicron scale at different stages of AD relative to their controls for both the tissue or cell and DNA cellular levels. The increase in the structural disorder in cells or tissues and DNA or chromatin in the nuclei can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations in the tissue and DNA or chromatin damage in the nuclei caused by the rearrangements of macromolecules due to the deposition of the amyloid beta protein and damage in DNA or chromatin with the progress of AD.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent-induced harmonics in nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</description>

      <title>Estimating the impact of light pollution on quantum communication between QEYSSat and Canadian quantum ground station sites</title>

Abstract: Satellite to ground quantum communication typically operates at night to reduce background signals, however it remains susceptible to noise from light pollution of the night sky. In this study we compare several methodologies for determining whether a Quantum Ground Station (QGS) site is viable for exchanging quantum signals with the upcoming Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission. We conducted ground site characterization studies at three locations in Canada: Waterloo, Ontario, Calgary, Alberta, and Priddis, Alberta. Using different methods we estimate the background counts expected to leak into the satellite-ground quantum channel, and determined whether the noise levels could prevent a quantum key transfer. We also investigate how satellite data recorded from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can help estimate conditions of a particular site, and find reasonable agreement with the locally recorded data. Our results indicate that the Waterloo, Calgary, and Priddis QGS sites should allow both quantum uplinks and downlinks with QEYSSat, despite their proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, our approach allows the use of satellite borne instrument data (VIIRS) to remotely and efficiently determine the potential of a ground site.</description>

      <title>General tradeoff relation of fundamental quantum limits for linear multiparameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear measurement is an important class of measurements for sensing classical signals including gravitational wave (GW), dark matter, infrared ray, rotation rate, etc. In this Letter, we focus on multiparameter linear measurement and establish a general tradeoff relation that tightly constrains the fundamental quantum limits of two independent parameters in a monochromatic classical signal detected by any linear quantum device. Such a tradeoff relation is universal and fundamental for multiparameter linear measurement since arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Compared with the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound, our tradeoff bound can completely identify the dependence between the attainable precision limits on estimated parameters. The dependence becomes more obvious such that the individual precision can not simultaneously reach the quantum limit as the so-called incompatible coefficient rises. Eventually, we find a necessary condition under which an optimal measurement protocol can saturate the general tradeoff relation, and show that the measurement phase can be tuned for adjusting different precision weight. This result is related to many applications, particularly detuned GW sensors for searching post-merger remnants due to the direct relation between the detuned frequency and incompatible coefficient.</description>

      <title>Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics in Finite-Bandwidth Squeezed Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction with squeezed vacuum has received much interest for the ability to enhance the native interaction strength between an atom and a photon with a reservoir assumed to have an infinite bandwidth. Here, we study a model of parametrically driven cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) for enhancing light-matter interaction while subjected to a finite-bandwidth squeezed vacuum drive. Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when including intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection. With these results, we outline the requirements for experimentally implementing an effectively squeezed bath in solid-state platforms such as InAs quantum dot cavity QED such that \textit{in situ} control and enhancement of light-matter interaction could be realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and classify topologically protected singularities for the reflection coefficient of transdimensional plasmonic systems. Originating from nonlocal electromagnetic response due to vertical electron confinement in the system, such singularities lead to lateral (angular) Goos-H\"anchen shifts on the millimeter (milliradian) scale in the visible range, greatly exceeding those reported previously for artificially designed metasurfaces, offering new opportunities for quantum material development.</description>

      <title>A flexible framework for large-scale FDTD simulations: open-source inverse design for 3D nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient open-source python package for the inverse design of three-dimensional photonic nanostructures using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. Leveraging a flexible reverse-mode automatic differentiation implementation, our software enables gradient-based optimization over large simulation volumes. Gradient computation is implemented within the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in Maxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and memory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods. Gradient-based optimization facilitates the automatic creation of intricate three-dimensional structures with millions of design parameters, which would be infeasible to design manually. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver from single to multiple GPUs through several inverse design examples, highlighting its robustness and performance in large-scale photonic simulations. In addition, the package features an object-oriented and user-friendly API that simplifies the specification of materials, sources, and constraints. Specifically, it allows for intuitive positioning and sizing of objects in absolute or relative coordinates within the simulation scene. By rapid specification of the desired design properties and rapid optimization within the given user constraints, this open-source framework aims to accelerate innovation in photonic inverse design. It yields a powerful and accessible computational tool for researchers, applicable in a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to photonic waveguides, active devices, and photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Near-to mid-IR spectral purity transfer with a tunable frequency comb: methanol frequency metrology over a record frequency span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the upgrade and operation of a frequency-comb-assisted high-resolution mid-infrared molecular spectrometer allowing us to combine high spectral purity, SI-traceability, wide tunability and high sensitivity. An optical frequency comb is used to transfer the spectral purity of a SI-traceable 1.54 $\mu$m metrology-grade frequency reference to a 10.3 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser (QCL). The near-infrared reference is operated at the French time/frequency metrology institute, calibrated there to primary frequency standards, and transferred to Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers via the REFIMEVE fiber network. The QCL exhibits a line width of $\delta\nu\sim 0.1$ Hz, a sub-$10^{-15}$ relative frequency stability from 0.1 to 10 s and its frequency is traceable to the SI with a total relative uncertainty better than $4\times10^{-14}$ after 1-s averaging time. We have developed the instrumentation allowing comb modes to be continuously tuned over 9 GHz resulting in a QCL of record spectral purity uninterruptedly tunable at the precision of the reference over an unprecedented span of $\Delta\nu$ = 1.4 GHz. We have used our apparatus to conduct sub-Doppler spectroscopy of methanol in a multi-pass cell, demonstrating state-of-art frequency uncertainties down to the few kilohertz level ($\sim10^{-10}$ in relative value). We have observed weak intensity resonances unreported so far, resolved subtle doublets never seen before and brought to light discrepancies with the HITRAN database. This demonstrates the potential of our apparatus for probing subtle internal molecular processes, building accurate spectroscopic models of polyatomic molecules of atmospheric or astrophysical interest, and carrying out precise spectroscopic tests of fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix Approach for Topological Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. Our approach uses the Iwasawa decomposition to parametrise the transfer matrix uniquely in terms of three real numbers. This allows us to obtain simple conditions for the existence of topologically protected edge states and to provide a visual illustration of all possible solutions. In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</description>
