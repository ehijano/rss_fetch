      <title>Can Large Language Models Design Biological Weapons? Evaluating Moremi Bio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in AI, particularly LLMs, have dramatically shortened drug discovery cycles by up to 40% and improved molecular target identification. However, these innovations also raise dual-use concerns by enabling the design of toxic compounds. Prompting Moremi Bio Agent without the safety guardrails to specifically design novel toxic substances, our study generated 1020 novel toxic proteins and 5,000 toxic small molecules. In-depth computational toxicity assessments revealed that all the proteins scored high in toxicity, with several closely matching known toxins such as ricin, diphtheria toxin, and disintegrin-based snake venom proteins. Some of these novel agents showed similarities with other several known toxic agents including disintegrin eristostatin, metalloproteinase, disintegrin triflavin, snake venom metalloproteinase, corynebacterium ulcerans toxin. Through quantitative risk assessments and scenario analyses, we identify dual-use capabilities in current LLM-enabled biodesign pipelines and propose multi-layered mitigation strategies. The findings from this toxicity assessment challenge claims that large language models (LLMs) are incapable of designing bioweapons. This reinforces concerns about the potential misuse of LLMs in biodesign, posing a significant threat to research and development (R&amp;D). The accessibility of such technology to individuals with limited technical expertise raises serious biosecurity risks. Our findings underscore the critical need for robust governance and technical safeguards to balance rapid biotechnological innovation with biosecurity imperatives.</description>

      <title>LASSO-ODE: A framework for mechanistic model identifiability and selection in disease transmission modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To be fully useful for public health practice, models for epidemic response must be able to do more than predict -- it is also important to incorporate the mechanisms underlying transmission dynamics to enable policymakers and practitioners to be able to evaluate what-if scenarios and intervention options. However, most mechanistic models suffer from uncertainty in both the parameters (e.g., parameter unidentifiability) and the model structure itself, which can hinder both successful parameter estimation and model interpretation. To enable rapid development of interpretable and parsimonious mechanistic models, we use penalized regression and covariate selection methods to integrate parameter identifiability and model selection directly into the parameter estimation procedure for (in this case) traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. For both simulated and real-world epidemiological data, we demonstrate that the LASSO-ODE framework is highly effective in selecting a parsimonious, identifiable model from larger, more realistic but potentially unidentifiable models, from realistically sparse data with only a single measured compartment and multiple latent (unobserved) variables. While we focus on epidemic models in this paper as a case study, these same approaches are applicable to a wide range of application areas that are faced with relatively sparse data but a need for realistic mechanistic models (e.g. mathematical oncology and mathematical biology more broadly). Additionally, the cross-validation techniques designed for time series data introduced in our study can be used across a range of time series analysis and modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>A graph-based approach for modification site assignment in proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background In proteomics, the most probable localizations of post-translational modifications are assessed by localization scores evaluating the likelihood of a given modification to occupy a site on a peptide sequence. When identifying highly modified peptides, localization scores for different modifications can return conflicting results, stacking modifications on the same amino acid. Here, we propose a graph-based approach that assigns modifications to sites in a way that maximizes localization scores while avoiding conflicting assignments. Results The algorithm is implemented as both a standalone Python program and in the compomics-utilities Java library. Our graph-based approach showed the ability to match complex combinations of modifications and acceptor sites, allowing the processing of thousands of peptides in a few seconds. Conclusions Our graph-based approach to modification site assignment allows distributing multiple modifications in a way that maximizes individual localization scores. Having an optimal modification site assignment is important for spectrum annotation and biological interpretation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian ensemble learning for predicting health outcomes of multipollutant mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the SoftBart approach from Bayesian ensemble learning to estimate the relationship between multipollutant mixtures and health on chronic exposures in epidemiology research. This approach offers several key advantages over existing methods: (1) it is computationally efficient and well-suited for analyzing large datasets; (2) it is flexible in estimating various correlated nonlinear functions simultaneously; and (3) it accurately identifies active variables within highly correlated multipollutant mixtures. Through simulations, we demonstrate the method's superiority by comparing its accuracy in estimating and quantifying uncertainties for both main and interaction effects with the commonly used method, BKMR. Last, we apply the method to analyze a multipollutant dataset with 10,110 participates from the Nurses' Health Study.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Image Capture for Computer Vision-Powered Taxonomic Identification and Trait Recognition of Biodiversity Specimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological collections house millions of specimens documenting Earth's biodiversity, with digital images increasingly available through open-access platforms. Most imaging protocols were developed for human visual interpretation without considering computational analysis requirements. This paper aims to bridge the gap between current imaging practices and the potential for automated analysis by presenting key considerations for creating biological specimen images optimized for computer vision applications. We provide conceptual computer vision topics for context, addressing fundamental concerns including model generalization, data leakage, and comprehensive metadata documentation, and outline practical guidance on specimen imagine, and data storage. These recommendations were synthesized through interdisciplinary collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and computer scientists. Through this synthesis, we have identified ten interconnected considerations that form a framework for successfully integrating biological specimen images into computer vision pipelines. The key elements include: (1) comprehensive metadata documentation, (2) standardized specimen positioning, (3) consistent size and color calibration, (4) protocols for handling multiple specimens in one image, (5) uniform background selection, (6) controlled lighting, (7) appropriate resolution and magnification, (8) optimal file formats, (9) robust data archiving strategies, and (10) accessible data sharing practices. By implementing these recommendations, collection managers, taxonomists, and biodiversity informaticians can generate images that support automated trait extraction, species identification, and novel ecological and evolutionary analyses at unprecedented scales. Successful implementation lies in thorough documentation of methodological choices.</description>

      <title>Chase-and-Run and Chirality in Nonlocal Models of Pattern Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chase-and-run dynamics, in which one population pursues another that flees from it, are found throughout nature, from predator-prey interactions in ecosystems to the collective motion of cells during development. Intriguingly, in many of these systems, the movement is not straight; instead, 'runners' veer off at an angle from their pursuers. This angled movement often exhibits a consistent left-right asymmetry, known as lateralisation or chirality. Inspired by such phenomena in zebrafish skin patterns and evasive animal motion, we explore how chirality shapes the emergence of patterns in nonlocal (integro-differential) advection-diffusion models. We extend such models to allow movement at arbitrary angles, uncovering a rich landscape of behaviours. We find that chirality can enhance pattern formation, suppress oscillations, and give rise to entirely new dynamical structures, such as rotating pulses of chasers and runners. We also uncover how chase-and-run dynamics can cause populations to mix or separate. Through linear stability analysis, we identify physical mechanisms that drive some of these effects, whilst also exposing striking limitations of this theory in capturing more complex dynamics. Our findings suggest that chirality could have roles in ecological and cellular patterning beyond simply breaking left-right symmetry.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Modeling of Protein Conformation and Dynamics via Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Spectral Parametrization Method (MMSPM) for analyzing EEG activity with distinct scaling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aperiodic neural activity has been the subject of intense research interest lately as it could reflect on the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is suspected to be affected in numerous clinical conditions. This phenomenon is characterized via the aperiodic scaling exponent $\beta$, equal to the spectral slope following log-log transformation of power spectra. Despite recent progress, however, most current methods do not take into consideration the plausible multimodal nature in the power spectra of neurophysiological recordings - i.e., $\beta$ might be different in low- ($\beta_{lo}$) and high-frequency ($\beta_{hi}$) regimes -, especially in case of $|\beta_{lo}|&gt;|\beta_{hi}|$. Here we propose an algorithm, the multi-modal spectral parametrization method (MMSPM) that aims to account for this issue. MMSPM estimates $\beta_{lo}$ and $\beta_{hi}$ separately using a constrained, piece-wise regression technique, and also assesses if they are significantly different or instead the spectrum is indeed unimodal and can be characterized simply with broadband $\beta$. Here we present the MMSPM algorithm and evaluate its performance in silico on simulated power spectra. Then, we use MMSPM on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 19 young, healthy volunteers, as well as on a separate dataset of EEG recordings from 30 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy controls, and demonstrate that broadband (0.1-100 Hz and 0.5-45 Hz) EEG spectra can indeed present a bimodality pattern with significantly steeper low-range ($&lt;\sim2$ Hz) and flatter high-range scaling regimes (i.e., $|\beta_{lo}|&gt;|\beta_{hi}|$).
  Clinical relevance: The MMSPM method characterizes aperiodic neural activity in distinct scaling regimes, which can be relevant in numerous pathological conditions such as dementia or schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>Generative Distribution Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems require reasoning across multiple scales, demanding models which operate not on single data points, but on entire distributions. We introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational biology: learning representations of cell populations from lineage-tracing data (150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on single-cell transcriptomes (1M cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell images), modeling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns (253M sequences), designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aimed to enhance protein sequence classification using natural language processing (NLP) techniques while addressing the impact of sequence similarity on model performance. We compared various machine learning and deep learning models under two different data-splitting strategies: random splitting and ECOD family-based splitting, which ensures evolutionary-related sequences are grouped together. Methods: The study evaluated models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Na\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting and Stacking classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and transformer models (BertForSequenceClassification, DistilBERT, and ProtBert). Performance was tested using different amino acid ranges and sequence lengths with a focus on generalization across unseen evolutionary families. Results: The Voting classifier achieved the highest performance with 74% accuracy, 74% weighted F1 score, and 65% macro F1 score under random splitting, while ProtBERT obtained 77% accuracy, 76% weighted F1 score, and 61% macro F1 score among transformer models. However, performance declined across all models when tested using ECOD-based splitting, revealing the impact of sequence similarity on classification performance. Conclusion: Advanced NLP techniques, particularly ensemble methods like Voting classifiers, and transformer models show significant potential in protein classification, with sufficient training data and sequence similarity management being crucial for optimal performance. However, the use of biologically meaningful splitting methods, such as ECOD family-based splitting, is crucial for realistic performance evaluation and generalization to unseen evolutionary families.</description>

      <title>DiffNMR2: NMR Guided Sampling Acquisition Through Diffusion Model Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometry uses electro-frequency pulses to probe the resonance of a compound's nucleus, which is then analyzed to determine its structure. The acquisition time of high-resolution NMR spectra remains a significant bottleneck, especially for complex biological samples such as proteins. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient sub-sampling strategy based on a diffusion model trained on protein NMR data. Our method iteratively reconstructs under-sampled spectra while using model uncertainty to guide subsequent sampling, significantly reducing acquisition time. Compared to state-of-the-art strategies, our approach improves reconstruction accuracy by 52.9\%, reduces hallucinated peaks by 55.6%, and requires 60% less time in complex NMR experiments. This advancement holds promise for many applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where rapid and high-resolution spectral analysis is critical.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Based 3D Multistage Transformer for Aberration Correction in Multicellular Specimens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Benefits of Joint Molecule Generation and Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the joint distribution of data samples and their properties allows to construct a single model for both data generation and property prediction, with synergistic benefits reaching beyond purely generative or predictive models. However, training joint models presents daunting architectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a transformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and predictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mechanism and a joint pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer is simultaneously optimized for molecule generation and property prediction, while exhibiting synergistic benefits in conditional sampling, out-of-distribution property prediction and representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of joint learning in a drug design use case of discovering novel antimicrobial~peptides.</description>

Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.</description>
