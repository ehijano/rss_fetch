      <title>A Wendelstein-7X Profile Database for Informed Transport Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance the development of future fusion devices beyond Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), a robust understanding of energy confinement time scaling is crucial. Universal temperature and density profile shapes are theoretically anticipated through a comparison of the empirical ISS04 confinement time scaling with predictions based on Gyro-Bohm heat flux scaling. This thesis investigates the presence of these universalities in W7-X experimental profiles and subsequently tests existing confinement time scalings against this data.
  Experimental profiles are obtained from Thomson scattering diagnostics. Gradient length scales, defined as the radial derivative of the logarithmic quantity of the investigated profiles, are extracted from these profiles through fitting procedures. These scales serve as boundary conditions for subsequent gyrokinetic flux-tube simulations using the GX code. The simulated heat fluxes are then employed to reconstruct profiles by solving the power balance equation and density evolution.
  A comparison of these reconstructed profiles with the averaged experimental profiles reveals that the predicted density profiles are steeper than those measured in the reference dataset. To investigate this discrepancy, additional discharges exhibiting more peaked density profiles, including both high-performance and low-power plasmas, are examined. Furthermore, the ratio of experimental temperature and density scale lengths is incorporated as an input into the simulations, and the resulting simulated heat fluxes are evaluated.
  Discrepancies between the simulated and measured profiles are discussed, with potential explanations encompassing particle sources and neoclassical transport mechanisms. This comprehensive approach aims to deepen our understanding of the critical role of profile shape and transport mechanisms in plasma confinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying plasma dynamics is crucial for understanding processes like inertial confinement fusion, material damage, and shockwave formation from intense laser or current interactions. While pump-probe methods are standard for capturing these dynamics, single-shot experiments using high-power, low-repetition-rate systems with custom targets are challenging. We present a novel imaging technique using a synchronized GHz-rate spectrally tagged probe laser to capture multiple time-resolved snapshots from a single pump event.</description>

      <title>Conceptual design of a Doppler Backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18532v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $&lt;$ $\rho$ $&lt;$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$&lt;$ $k_{\perp}$ $&lt;$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\sim35^{\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).</description>

      <title>Intermittent Viscoelastic Turbulence in Strongly Coupled Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence in strongly coupled plasmas (SCP) poses a unique challenge due to long-range interparticle interactions that impart viscoelastic properties to the medium. We report the first observation of intermittent viscoelastic turbulence in such plasmas using large-scale three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. In driven dissipative SCP, we observe scale-dependent flow dynamics arising from the interplay between potential (elastic) and viscous dissipation at the particle level. Unlike conventional turbulence, governed by inertia and viscosity, SCP exhibits distinct energy transfer processes due to its intrinsic viscoelasticity. Both kinetic and elastic energy spectra show power-law scaling $E(k), \Phi(k) \propto k^{-3.5}$. In real space, velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and the probability distribution functions of velocity increments deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior, especially in the tails, signatures of intermittency. These findings establish SCP as a novel platform for studying viscoelastic turbulence, with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Wall damage due to oblique high velocity dust impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway electron termination on plasma facing components can trigger material explosions that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Due to the large kinetic energies of the ejected dust particles, their subsequent mechanical impacts on the vessel lead to extensive cratering. Earlier experimental studies of high velocity micrometric tungsten dust collisions with tungsten plates focused exclusively on normal impacts. Here, oblique high velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system. The strong dependence of the crater characteristics and crater morphology on the incident angle is documented. A reliable empirical damage law is extracted for the dependence of the crater depth on the incident angle.</description>

      <title>Efficient Particle Acceleration in 2.5-Dimensional, Hybrid-Kinetic Simulations of Decaying, Supersonic, Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\alpha \approx -\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\alpha \approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical implications of this theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Stability and optical quality of liquid crystal films as high repetition rate plasma mirrors in staged laser-plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new "windmill" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.</description>

      <title>A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.</description>

      <title>A class of high-beta, large-aspect-ratio quasiaxisymmetric Palumbo-like configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space of high-beta, approximately quasiaxisymmetric, large-aspect-ratio stellarator configurations is explored using an inverse coordinate approach and a quadratic polynomial ansatz for the flux function, following the method of Palumbo, extended by Hernandes and Clemente. This approach yields a system of nonlinear ODEs that, when solved, give equilibria exhibiting positive or negative triangularity, cusps, and (in an extreme limit) current singularities. It is shown that a cubic ansatz may also be used, but that polynomials of degree four or higher will lead to overdetermination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Galilean electromagnetic particle-in-cell (GEM-PIC) algorithm, which transforms the full set of Maxwell equations and the Vlasov equation into the boosted coordinates. This approach preserves the electromagnetic structure of the interaction while exploiting scale separation for computational effi ciency. Unlike quasistatic methods, GEM-PIC does not have to distinguish between beam and streaming particles, allowing a self-consistent treatment of particle trapping. The EM-PIC algorithm allows for highly effi cient and accurate simulations of plasma-based wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>
