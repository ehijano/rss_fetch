      <title>Simple, subdirectly irreducible weakly dicomplemented lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we exhibit several subclasses of weakly dicomplemented lattices (WDLs) based on their skeletons and dual skeletons. We investigate normal filters (resp. ideals) and show that the set of normal filters (resp. ideals) forms a complete lattice, which is not a sublattice of the lattice of all filters (ideals). The normal filter (ideal) generated by a subset and the join of two normal filters (resp. ieals) are characterized. We further prove that the lattice of normal filters is isomorphic to the lattice of normal ideals, and that the only class of filters (or ideals) that generate a congruence in WDLs is the class of normal filters. For distributive WDLs, the congruences generated by filters are characterized. Using normal filters, we characterize simple, subdirectly irreducible, and regular WDLs. Moreover, it is shown that the congruences generated by normal filters are permutable, and that regular distributive WDLs are congruence-permutable and verify the congruence extension property (CEP). Finally, we prove that, under certain conditions, the lattice of normal filters is isomorphic to the lattice of filters of the Boolean center of a distributive WDL. It is also established that the lattice of normal filters of a WDL $L$ embeds into the lattice of normal filters of the power $L^{X}$ of $L$.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Computation Beyond The Reflexive Regime: Endpoint Solvability Complexity Index And Type-2 Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) of Koopman operator spectral computation in the information-based framework of towers of algorithms. Given a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ with a finite Borel measure $\omega$ on $\mathcal{X}$ and a continuous nonsingular map $F:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, our focus is the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}_F$ acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $p\in\{1,\infty\}$ for the computational problem \[ \Xi_{\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}}(F) :=\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}\!\bigl(\mathcal{K}_F\bigr), \] with input access given by point evaluations of $F\mapsto F(x)$ (and fixed quadrature access to $\omega$).
  We clarify how the $L^1$ case can be brought into the same oracle model as the reflexive regime $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ by proving a uniform finite-dimensional quadrature compatibility, while highlighting the fundamentally different role played by non-separability at $p=\infty$.
  Beyond Koopman operators, we also construct a prototype family of decision problems $(\Xi_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}$ realizing prescribed finite tower heights, providing a reusable reduction source for future SCI lower bounds. Finally, we place these results deeper in the broader computational landscape of Type-2/Weihrauch theory.</description>

      <title>Disjoint non-forking amalgamation in stable AECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{disjoint amalgamation property} (DAP), which asserts that all spans of a class of models can be amalgamated with minimal intersection, is an important property in the context of abstract elementary classes, with connections to both Grossberg's question and Shelah's categoricity conjecture. We prove that, in a nice AEC $\mathbf{K}$ stable in $\lambda \geq \operatorname{LS}(\mathbf{K})$ with a strong enough independence relation, all high cofinality $\lambda$-limit models are disjoint (non-forking) amalgamation bases.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$
  Let $\mathbf{K}$ be an AEC stable in $\lambda$, where $\mathbf{K}_\lambda$ has AP, JEP, and NMM, and let $\mathbf{K}'$ be some AC where $\mathbf{K}_{(\lambda,\geq\kappa)} \subseteq \mathbf{K}' \subseteq \mathbf{K}_\lambda$. Suppose there is an independence relation on $\mathbf{K}'$ satisfying uniqueness, existence, non-forking amalgamation, $\mathbf{K}_{(\lambda,\geq\kappa)}$-universal continuity* in $\mathbf{K}_\lambda$, and $(\geq \kappa)$-local character.
  Assume $M_0, M_1, M_2 \in \mathbf{K}_{(\lambda,\geq\kappa)}$, and that $M_0 \leq_{\mathbf{K}} M_l$ and $a_l \in M_l$ for $l = 1, 2$. Then there exist $N \in \mathbf{K}_{(\lambda,\geq\kappa)}$ and $f_l : M_l \rightarrow N$ fixing $M_0$ for $l = 1, 2$ such that $\operatorname{gtp}(f_l(a_l)/f_{3-l}[M_{3-l}], N)$ does not fork over $M_0$ and $f_1[M_1] \cap f_2[M_2] = M_0$. That is, our independence relation has disjoint non-forking amalgamation.
  In particular, every $M_0 \in \mathbf{K}_{(\lambda,\geq\kappa)}$ is a disjoint amalgamation base in $\mathbf{K}_\lambda$.
  The hypotheses on the independence relation can be weakened (closer to $\lambda$-non-splitting in $\lambda$-stable AECs) if we are willing to give up the `non-forking' conditions of the amalgamation.</description>

      <title>Examples and counterexamples of injective types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, in univalent mathematics, type universes, the type of $n$-types in a universe, reflective subuniverses, and the underlying type of any algebra of the lifting monad are all (algebraically) injective. Here, we further show that the type of ordinals, the type of iterative (multi)sets, the underlying type of any pointed directed complete poset, as well as the types of (small) $\infty$-magmas, monoids, and groups are all injective, among other examples. Not all types of mathematical structures are injective in general. For example, the type of inhabited types is injective if and only if all propositions are projective. In contrast, the type of pointed types and the type of non-empty types are always injective. The injectivity of the type of two-element types implies Fourman and \v{S}\v{c}edrov's world's simplest axiom of choice. We also show that there are no nontrivial small injective types unless a weak propositional resizing principle holds. Other counterexamples include the type of booleans, the simple types, the type of Dedekind reals, and the type of conatural numbers, whose injectivity implies weak excluded middle. More generally, any type with an apartness relation and two points apart cannot be injective unless weak excluded middle holds. Finally, we show that injective types have no non-trivial decidable properties, unless weak excluded middle holds, which amounts to a Rice-like theorem for injective types.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism relations on classes of c.e. algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of isomorphism relations for classes of finitely generated and n-generated computably enumerable (c.e.) algebras, presented via c.e. presentations -- that is, as quotients of term algebras over decidable sets of generators by c.e. congruences. Our goal is to develop a systematic framework for analyzing such isomorphism problems from a computability-theoretic perspective. To compare their complexity, we employ the notion of computable reducibility, measuring these relations against canonical benchmarks on c.e. sets, such as =^{ce}, E_0^{ce}, and the ordinal-indexed family E_min(\alpha). A central insight of our work is the interplay between the algebraic structure and the algorithmic complexity: we show that if every algebra in a class satisfies the ascending chain condition on its congruence lattice, then the corresponding isomorphism relation is computably reducible to =^{ce}. We also apply this framework to a range of concrete cases. In particular, we analyze the isomorphism relations for finitely generated commutative semigroups, monoids, and groups, positioning them within the broader landscape of classification problems.</description>

      <title>On the problem of generalized measures: an impossibility result</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of extending measure theory to non-separable structures, from generalized descriptive set theory to a broader class of spaces beyond this framework. While various notions, such as the ideal of measure zero sets, have been generalized, the question of whether a satisfactory notion of $\lambda^+$-measure could be defined in generalized descriptive set theory has remained open. We introduce a broad class of $\lambda^+$-measures as functions taking values in arbitrary positively totally ordered monoids equipped with an infinitary sum. This definition relies on minimal assumptions and captures most natural generalizations of measures to this context. We then prove that, under certain cardinal assumptions, no continuous $\lambda^+$-measure of this kind exists on ${}^\kappa\lambda$, nor on any $\lambda^+$-Borel space or $T_0$ topological space of weight at most $\lambda$. We also show the optimality of these cardinal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Causal Modalities in General Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality is one of the fundamental structures of spacetimes, it determines the possible behaviour and propagation of physical information through different relations. Causal structure can be analysed through the various modal logics it induces. The modal logics for the standard chronological and causal relations of the archetypal Minkowski spacetime have been classified. However only partial results have been achieved for the strict variant of the causal relation, also known as the after relation.
  The present work continues this analysis towards arbitrary spacetimes. By utilizing the definition of the causal relations through causal paths, we can lift known results about the modal logics of Minkowski spacetime to general spacetimes. In particular, for the after relation, we show that a previously studied formula within the logics of Minkowski spacetime holds in arbitrary spacetimes. We introduce a related modal formula that demonstrates that the logic of two-dimensional spacetimes are more expressive than higher dimensional ones. Lastly, we study the interrelation between the logical properties and physical properties along the causal ladder, a classification of causal structures according to a hierarchy of physically relevant properties.</description>

      <title>Sets of Ramsey-limit points and IP-limit points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an uncountable Polish space and let $\mathcal{H}$ be the Hindman ideal, that is, the family of all $S\subseteq \omega$ which are not $IP$-sets. For each sequence $x=(x_n)_{n \in \omega}$ taking values in $X$, let $\Lambda_{x}(FS)$ be the set of $IP$-limit points of $x$. Also, let $\Lambda_{x}(\mathcal{H})$ be the set of $\mathcal{H}$-limit points of $x$, that is, the set of ordinary limits of subsequences $(x_n)_{n \in S}$ with $S\notin \mathcal{H}$. After proving that these two notions do not coincide in general, we show that both families of nonempty sets of the type $\Lambda_{x}(FS)$ and of the type $\Lambda_{x}(\mathcal{H})$ are precisely the class of nonempty analytic subsets of $X$.
  An analogous result holds also for Ramsey convergence. In the proofs, we use the concept of partition regular functions introduced in J. Symb. Log. (2024) [doi:10.1017/jsl.2024.8], which provide a unified approach to these types of convergence.</description>

      <title>A Complexity Dichotomy for Temporal Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) for every valued structure with the domain ${\mathbb Q}$ that is preserved by all order-preserving bijections. Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};&lt;)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms. This is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Abelian congruences and similarity in varieties with a weak difference term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of three papers motivated by the author's desire to understand and explain "algebraically" one aspect of Dmitriy Zhuk's proof of the CSP Dichotomy Theorem. In this paper we study abelian congruences in varieties having a weak difference term. Each class of the congruence supports an abelian group structure; if the congruence is minimal, each class supports the structure of a vector space over a division ring determined by the congruence. A construction due to J. Hagemann, C. Herrmann and R. Freese in the congruence modular setting extends to varieties with a weak difference term, and provides a "universal domain" for the abelian groups or vector spaces that arise from the classes of the congruence within a single class of the annihilator of the congruence. The construction also supports an extension of Freese's similarity relation (between subdirectly irreducible algebras) from the congruence modular setting to varieties with a weak difference term.</description>

We then connect bridges to centrality and similarity. In particular, we prove that Zhuk's bridges and our "similarity bridges" (defined in our first paper) convey the same information in locally finite Taylor varieties.</description>

      <title>The associative-poset point of view on right regular bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two results on the relation between the class of right regular bands (RRBs) and their underlying *associative posets*. The first one is a construction of a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that takes an RRB $(P,\cdot)$ to the corresponding $(P,\leq)$. The construction of such a left adjoint is actually done in general for any class of relational structures $(X,R)$ obtained from a variety, where $R$ is defined by a finite conjunction of identities. The second result generalizes the "inner" representations of direct product decompositions of semilattices studied by the second author to RRBs having at least one commuting element.</description>

      <title>MSO logic of the real order with the set quantifiers ranging over the Borel sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23003v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated 1969 theorem of Michael Rabin is that the MSO theory of the real order where the monadic quantifier is allowed only to range over the sets of rational numbers, is decidable. In 1975 Saharon Shelah proved that if the monadic quantifier is allowed to range over all subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is undecidable. He conjectured that when we allow the monadic quantifier to range over the Borel subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is decidable. We confirm this conjecture. Namely, the MSO theory of the real order where the set quantifier is allowed to range over the Borel sets, is decidable. If we only ask for the decidability in the language where each level of the Borel hierarchy is allowed a quantifier to denote sets of that level in the hierarchy, then we obtain a weaker MSO theory, which is not inly decidable but also interpretable in S2S.</description>

      <title>Complexity of deep computations via topology of function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use topological methods to study complexity of deep computations and limit computations. We use topology of function spaces, specifically, the classification Rosenthal compacta, to identify new complexity classes. We use the language of model theory, specifically, the concept of \emph{independence} from Shelah's classification theory, to translate between topology and computation. We use the theory of Rosenthal compacta to characterize approximablility of deep computations, both deterministically and probabilistically.</description>

      <title>Countable-Support Symmetric Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for iterating symmetric extensions with \emph{countable support}. Assuming the successor-step two-stage symmetric-system construction from the standard finite-support theory, we define the countable-support iteration and its induced automorphism groups, taking $\omega_1$-completions of the successor-stage symmetry filters. At limit stages of uncountable cofinality, countable supports are bounded and we use the resulting direct-limit presentation, and at limits of cofinality $\omega$ we use the inverse-limit presentation induced by restriction maps. We define canonical limit symmetry filters generated by head pullbacks from earlier stages: at limits of cofinality $&gt;\omega$ we take the smallest normal filter containing these generators (and prove it is $\omega_1$--complete by stage-bounding), while at limits of cofinality $\omega$ we take the smallest normal $\omega_1$--complete filter extending the same generators. In either case the resulting limit filter is normal and $\omega_1$--complete.
  Using this, we define the class of hereditarily symmetric names at each stage and prove closure under the operations required for the $ZF$ axioms. In particular, the resulting symmetric model satisfies $ZF$; for set-length stages over a $ZFC$ ground, the resulting symmetric model satisfies $DC=DC_\omega$. Finally, when the iteration template is first-order definable over a $GBC$ ground with Global Choice and sufficient class recursion (e.g.\ $GBC+\mathsf{ETR}$), the same scheme extends to class-length iterations, and the final symmetric model is obtained by evaluating hereditarily symmetric class-names.</description>

      <title>Analytic holonomicity of real C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, called distributions of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class, based on wavelet transforms of distributions and the theory from Cluckers, Comte, Miller, Rolin, Servi (2018) about C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class functions. We prove that the framework of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class distributions is closed under natural operations, like push-forward, pull-back, derivation and anti-derivation, and, in the tempered case, Fourier transforms. Our main result is the (real analytic) holonomicity of all distributions of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class.</description>

      <title>Reflexive graph lenses in univalent foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Martin-L\"of's identity types provide a generic (albeit opaque) notion of identification or "equality" between any two elements of the same type, embodied in a canonical reflexive graph structure $(=_A, \mathbf{refl})$ on any type $A$. The miracle of Voevodsky's univalence principle is that it ensures, for essentially any naturally occurring structure in mathematics, that this the resultant notion of identification is equivalent to the type of isomorphisms in the category of such structures. Characterisations of this kind are not automatic and must be established one-by-one; to this end, several authors have employed reflexive graphs and displayed reflexive graphs to organise the characterisation of identity types. We contribute reflexive graph lenses, a new family of intermediate abstractions lying between families of reflexive graphs and displayed reflexive graphs that simplifies the characterisation of identity types for complex structures. Every reflexive graph lens gives rise to a (more complicated) displayed reflexive graph, and our experience suggests that many naturally occurring displayed reflexive graphs arise in this way. Evidence for the utility of reflexive graph lenses is given by means of several case studies, including the theory of reflexive graphs itself as well as that of polynomial type operators. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence between the type of reflexive graph fibrations and the type of univalent reflexive graph lenses.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity in Coxeter groups and split crystallographic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that affine Coxeter groups, even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and one-ended hyperbolic Coxeter groups are homogeneous in the sense of model theory. More generally, we prove that many (Gromov) hyperbolic groups generated by torsion elements are homogeneous. In contrast, we construct split crystallographic groups that are not homogeneous, and hyperbolic (in fact, virtually free) Coxeter groups that are not homogeneous (or, to be more precise, not $\mathrm{EAE}$-homogeneous). We also prove that, on the other hand, irreducible split crystallographic groups and torsion-generated hyperbolic groups are almost homogeneous. We also prove that finitely generated abelian-by-finite groups are homogeneous if and only if they are profinitely homogeneous, i.e., any tuple of words from the group is profinitely rigid. We use this to deduce that affine Coxeter groups are profinitely homogeneous, a result of independent interest in the profinite context.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--diffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which asserts that for integer regularities, a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relations and interactions between the theorems of Ash, Herwig-Lascar and Ribes-Zalesskii are discussed and it is shown that these three theorems are equivalent in the sense that each of them can be derived from each other one. Some strengthening of these theorems that can be obtained by use of the groups provided by the third author's construction are also considered.</description>

      <title>Determining the Winner in Alternating-Move Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for determining the winner in two-player win-lose alternating-move games on trees, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the target set. We focus our study on special cases, including the Gale-Stewart game on the complete binary tree and a family of Schmidt games. Building on the Hausdorff dimension games originally introduced by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba\'nski, which provide a game-theoretic approach for computing Hausdorff dimensions, we employ a generalized family of these games, and show that they are useful for analyzing sets underlying the win-lose games we study.</description>
