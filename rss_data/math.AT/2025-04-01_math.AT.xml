      <title>A formula for the mod $p$ cohomology of $BPU(p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23399v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mod $p$ cohomology ring of the classifying space $BPU(p)$ of the projective unitary group $PU(p)$, when $p$ is an odd prime. We prove a mod $p$ formula analogous to a formula of Vistoli for the integral cohomology ring of $BPU(p)$. As an application, we give a simple topological proof of Vistoli's formula.</description>

      <title>Persistent Stanley--Reisner Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) has emerged as an effective approach in data science, with its key technique, persistent homology, rooted in algebraic topology. Although alternative approaches based on differential topology, geometric topology, and combinatorial Laplacians have been proposed, combinatorial commutative algebra has hardly been developed for machine learning and data science. In this work, we introduce persistent Stanley-Reisner theory to bridge commutative algebra, combinatorial algebraic topology, machine learning, and data science. We propose persistent h-vectors, persistent f-vectors, persistent graded Betti numbers, persistent facet ideals, and facet persistence modules. Stability analysis indicates that these algebraic invariants are stable against geometric perturbations. We employ a machine learning prediction on a molecular dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed persistent Stanley-Reisner theory for practical applications.</description>

      <title>The Face Group of a Simplicial Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge group of a simplicial complex is a well-known, combinatorial version of the fundamental group. It is a group associated to a simplicial complex that consists of equivalence classes of edge loops and that is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) fundamental group of the spatial realization. We define a counterpart to the edge group that likewise gives a combinatorial version of the second (higher) homotopy group. Working entirely combinatorially, we show our group is an abelian group and also respects products. We show that our combinatorially defined group is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) second homotopy group of the spatial realization.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of factorization systems on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of factorization systems on finite lattices, paying special attention to the role that reflective and coreflective factorization systems play in partitioning the poset of factorization systems on a fixed lattice. We ultimately uncover an intricate web of relations with such diverse combinatorial structures as submonoids, monads, Moore systems, transfer systems (from stable equivariant homotopy theory), and poly-Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of moduli spaces of real weighted stable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ordinary and $S_n$-equivariant fundamental groups of the moduli space $\overline{M_{0,n+1}}(\mathbb{R})$ of real $(n+1)$-marked stable curves of genus $0$ are known as \emph{cactus groups} $J_n$ and have applications both in geometry and the representation theory of Lie algebras. In this paper, we compute the ordinary and $S_n$-equivariant fundamental groups of the Hassett space of weighted real stable curves $\overline{M_{0,\mathcal{A}}}(\mathbb{R})$ with $S_n$-symmetric weight vector $\mathcal{A} = (1/a, \ldots, 1/a, 1)$, which we call \emph{weighted cactus groups} $J_n^a$. We show that $J_n^a$ is obtained from the usual cactus presentation by introducing braid relations, which successively simplify the group from $J_n$ to $S_n \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ as $a$ increases. Our proof is by decomposing $\overline{M_{0,\mathcal{A}}}(\mathbb{R})$ as a polytopal complex, generalizing a similar known decomposition for $\overline{M_{0,n+1}}(\mathbb{R})$. In the unweighted case, these cells are known to be cubes and are `dual' to the usual decomposition into associahedra (by the combinatorial type of the stable curve). For $\overline{M_{0,\mathcal{A}}}(\mathbb{R})$, our decomposition instead consists of products of permutahedra. The cells of the decomposition are indexed by weighted stable trees, but `dually' to the usual indexing.</description>

      <title>Breaking symmetries for equivariant coarse homology theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a symmetry breaking construction in coarse geometry which allows to obtain information about equivariant coarse homology classes by restriction to smaller groups and spaces. In the case of equivariant coarse $K$-homology theory we give an analytic interpretation of this construction. As a consequence we obtain applications to the spectral theory of invariant differential operators.</description>

      <title>Tagged barcodes for the topological analysis of gradient-like vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intending to introduce a method for the topological analysis of fields, we present a pipeline that takes as an input a weighted and based chain complex, produces a factored chain complex, and encodes it as a barcode of tagged intervals (briefly, a tagged barcode). We show how to apply this pipeline to the weighted and based Morse chain complex of a gradient-like Morse-Smale vector field on a compact Riemannian manifold in both the smooth and discrete settings. Interestingly for computations, it turns out that there is an isometry between factored chain complexes endowed with the interleaving distance and their tagged barcodes endowed with the bottleneck distance. Concerning stability, we show that the map taking a generic enough gradient-like vector field to its barcode of tagged intervals is continuous. Finally, we prove that the tagged barcode of any such vector field can be approximated by the tagged barcode of a combinatorial version of it with arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Sequential parametrized topological complexity of group epimorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the sequential analogue of Grant's parametrized topological complexity of group epimorphisms, which generalizes the sequential topological complexity of groups. We derive bounds for sequential parametrized topological complexity based on the cohomological dimension of certain subgroups, thereby extending the corresponding bounds for sequential topological complexity of groups. We also obtain sequential analogs of (new) lower bounds on parametrized topological complexity of epimorphisms which are recently obtained by Espinosa Baro, Farber, Mescher and Oprea. Finally, we utilize these results to provide alternative computations for the sequential parametrized topological complexity of planar Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations.</description>

      <title>Notes on Pointwise Finite-Dimensional $2$-Parameter Persistence Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pointwise finite-dimensional (p.f.d.) $2$-parameter persistence modules where each module admits a finite convex isotopy subdivision. We show that a p.f.d. $2$-parameter persistence module $M$ (with a finite convex isotopy subdivision) is isomorphic to a $2$-parameter persistence module $N$ where the restriction of $N$ to each chamber of the parameter space $(\mathbb{R},\leq)^2$ is a constant functor. Moreover, we show that the convex isotopy subdivision of $M$ induces a finite encoding of $M$. Finally, we prove that every indecomposable thin $2$-parameter persistence module is isomorphic to a polytope module.</description>

      <title>A local-global principle for parametrized $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a local-global principle for $\infty$-categories over any base $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$: we show that any $\infty$-category $\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{C}$ over $\mathcal{C}$ is determined by the following data: the collection of fibers $\mathcal{B}_X$ for $X$ running through the set of equivalence classes of objects of $\mathcal{C}$ endowed with the action of the space of automorphisms $\mathrm{Aut}_X(\mathcal{B})$ on the fiber, the local data, together with a locally cartesian fibration $\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ and $\mathrm{Aut}_X(\mathcal{B})$-linear equivalences $\mathcal{D}_X \simeq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B}_X)$ to the $\infty$-category of presheaves on $\mathcal{B}_X$, the gluing data. As applications we describe the $\infty$-category of small $\infty$-categories over $[1]$ in terms of the $\infty$-category of left fibrations and prove an end formula for mapping spaces of the internal hom of the $\infty$-category of small $\infty$-categories over $[1]$ and the conditionally existing internal hom of the $\infty$-category of small $\infty$-categories over any small $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}.$ Considering functoriality in $\mathcal{C}$ we obtain as a corollary that the double $\infty$-category $\mathrm{CORR}$ of correspondences is the pullback of the double $\infty$-category $\mathrm{PR}^L$ of presentable $\infty$-categories along the functor $\infty\mathrm{Cat} \to \mathrm{Pr}^L$ taking presheaves. We deduce that $\infty$-categories over any $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ are classified by normal lax 2-functors.</description>

      <title>Persistent (Co)Homology in Matrix Multiplication Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most algorithms for computing persistent homology do so by tracking cycles that represent homology classes. There are many choices of such cycles, and specific choices have found different uses in applications. Although it is known that persistence diagrams can be computed in matrix multiplication time [8] for the more general case of zigzag persistent homology, it is not clear how to extract cycle representatives, especially if specific representatives are desired. In this paper, we provide the same matrix multiplication bound for computing representatives for the two choices common in applications in the case of ordinary persistent (co)homology. We first provide a fast version of the reduction algorithm, which is simpler than the algorithm in [8], but returns a different set of representatives than the standard algorithm [6] We then give a fast version of a different variant called the row algorithm [4], which returns the same representatives as the standard algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1610.10043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any preadditive infinity category with duality gives rise to a direct sum hermitian K-theory spectrum. This assignment is lax symmetric monoidal, thereby producing E-infinity ring spectra from preadditive symmetric monoidal infinity categories with duality. To have examples of preadditive symmetric monoidal infinity categories with duality we show that any preadditive symmetric monoidal infinity category, in which every object admits a dual, carries a canonical duality. Moreover we classify and twist the dualities in various ways and apply our definitions for example to finitely generated projective modules over E-infinity ring spectra.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that certain spherical fibrations over certain CW-complexes are stably fibre homotopy equivalent to $\mm{TOP}$-spherical fibrations (see Definition 1,1). Applying this result, we get a sufficient condition for whether a Poincar$\mm{\acute{e}}$ complex is of the homotopy type of a topological manifold. Moreover, we present the classification for some highly connected manifolds by the homotopy types of highly connected Poincar$\mm{\acute{e}}$ complexes.</description>
