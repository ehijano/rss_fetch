      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlocal Beam Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the dynamics of nonlocal beams by establishing a consistent stress-driven integral elastic using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach. Specifically, a PINN is developed to compute the first eigenfunction and eigenvalue arising from the underlying sixth-order ordinary differential equation. The PINN is based on a feedforward neural network, with a loss function composed of terms from the differential equation, the normalization condition, and both boundary and constitutive boundary conditions. Relevant eigenvalues are treated as separate trainable variables. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is a powerful and robust tool for addressing the complexity of the problem. Once trained, the neural network is less computationally intensive than analytical methods. The obtained results are compared with benchmark analytical solutions and show strong agreement.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the connection in affine models of gravity: Can the connection tell us something about the metric?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics geometrical connections are the mean to create models with local symmetries (gauge connections), as well as general diffeomorphisms invariance (affine connections). Here we study the irreducible tensor decomposition of connections on the tangent bundle of an affine manifold as used in the polynomial affine model of gravity. This connection is the most general linear connection, which allows us to build metric independent, diffeomorphism invariant models. This set up includes parts of the connection that are associated with conformal and projective transformations.</description>

      <title>Addendum: Modeling the amplitude and energy decay of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator using the energy dissipation rate and a simple trick (2025 Eur. J. Phys. 46(1) 015004)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to adapt the approach introduced for viscous damping in [1] to derive the approximate amplitude decay in the case of damping by a force of constant magnitude (sliding friction) and in the case of damping by a force proportional to the square of velocity (air resistance). We obtain two first-order differential equations from which we obtain the approximate time-dependent amplitudes corresponding to the considered damping forces. Our approach is suitable for first-year undergraduates, as it relies on the physical concepts and mathematical techniques they are familiar with.</description>
