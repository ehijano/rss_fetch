      <title>The influence of heavy quark potential on quarkonium production in quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remler formalism is the Wigner projection of a two particle state to bound states, which is carried out when the bound state begins to exist or when one of the two particles scatters in medium. This method has been successfully applied to quarkonium production in box simulations and in heavy-ion collisions. In this study this method is extended to strongly bound states with considerable binding energies by taking into account the potential energy between heavy quark pairs in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). We find that an attractive heavy-quark potential enhances quarkonium production and the results are consistent with those from the statistical model in box simulations, if a proper spatial cutoff is introduced to the potential to mimic quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Understanding Charge Radii with Machine Learning: Discovering Physics Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a robust, interpretable machine learning (ML) framework that combines numerical regression for high-accuracy predictions with symbolic regression to uncover the underlying physics. This hybrid approach effciently derives analytical expressions by leveraging the smoothed predictions of optimized ML models, a significant acceleration over direct symbolic regression on raw experimental data.
  We apply this framework, as an example, to nuclear charge radii across the nuclear chart, notably including light nuclei that are often excluded from such studies. We employ Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models to map correlations between charge radii and key physical features: mass $A^{1/3}$ and proton number $Z^{1/3}$ dependencies, total binding energy, and for the first time, the pairing gap. Our models are rigorously trained using four-fold cross-validation with automated hyperparameter optimization, ensuring robustness and generalizability, which is critical for the typically small and skewed datasets in nuclear physics. Finally, we distill the knowledge from the initial LGBM and GPR models into simplified, interpretable mathematical expressions via symbolic regression, white-boxing these ML models. The derived formulas provide physical insights comparable to traditional many-body models and demonstrate a powerful pathway for physics expression discovery guided by ML.</description>

      <title>Direct Boundary Matching: A Bound-State Technique for Nuclear Scattering with Lagrange-Legendre Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a direct boundary matching method (DBMM) for solving nuclear scattering problems using Lagrange-Legendre basis functions. This approach belongs to the family of bound-state techniques for the continuum, reformulating scattering problems into a localized, square-integrable ($L^2$) representation. The key feature is the direct incorporation of the outgoing wave boundary condition into the last row of the matrix equation, eliminating the need for Bloch operators and two-step matching procedures required in traditional R-matrix methods. Unlike the complex scaling method that rotates coordinates into the complex plane, DBMM operates entirely in real coordinate space. The formalism is extended to coupled-channel problems, where the wave function decomposition naturally leads to an effective source potential that distinguishes between the entrance channel and other channels. Benchmark calculations for p~+~$^{12}$C scattering demonstrate excellent agreement with the Numerov integration method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Heavy-Quark Dissipation and Jet Transport Parameters from D-Meson observables in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous Bayesian inference of the temperature-dependent heavy-quark spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T\mathcal{D}_s$ and the scaled jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}/T^3$ in the quark-gluon plasma, utilizing $D$-meson nuclear modification factor $R_\text{AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ data from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}} = 5.02\ \text{TeV}$. The analysis employs a unified improved Langevin transport model that incorporates both collisional and radiative energy loss, followed by coalescence plus fragmentation hadronization. The posterior distributions of the parameters of $\hat{q}/T^3$ and those of $2\pi T\mathcal{D}_s$ are well constrained, and compared with the results of theoretical models or other experimental data extraction, respectively. The $30-50\%$ centrality data provide significantly stronger constraints than the $0-10\%$ data. The extracted ratio $\hat{q}/\kappa$ between the quark jet transport and heavy-quark diffusion coefficients exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, deviating from the value $2$ estimated from the definition, with a value interval spanning 0.25--0.8 corresponding to the mean values of the inferred parameters. This work establishes a data-driven quantitative relationship between these two fundamental transport properties in the same observables, offering crucial insight into their interplay in the strongly coupled medium.</description>

      <title>Shell-model calculation with density-dependent interaction for $pf$-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell-model calculations with density-dependent interactions are performed to investigate $pf$-shell nuclei, examining the ground-state energies, low-lying spectra, and $E2$ transition probabilities. The density-dependent terms in the interaction are self-consistently determined using the shell-model wave function for the ground state. We test three density-dependent interactions adapted from density functionals of Gogny-D1S, Gogny-GT2, and M3Y-P6. The shell-model results satisfactorily agree with the experimental data. However, the Gogny-D1S and Gogny-GT2 fail to reproduce the magicity of $N=28$, while it is properly described by the M3Y-P6 functional.</description>

      <title>Absence of charged pion condensation in a magnetic field with parallel rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf120}, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Gamow shell model predictions for six-proton unbound nucleus $^{20}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-rich nuclei beyond the proton drip line are of great interest in nuclear structure physics, due to exotic phenomena such as proton emissions and the Thomas-Ehrman shift (TES). In this work, we employ the Gamow shell model (GSM) to investigate the structure and decay of $^{20}$Si, a candidate for six-proton (6$p$) emission, which can be produced via two-neutron knockout from the drip line nucleus $^{22}$Si. We predict that its ground state decays via $6p$ emission to the ground state of $^{14}$O, with a decay energy $E_{6p} = 10.125$ MeV and a width of 371~keV. A $2^+$ state is predicted at 1.7 MeV, comparable with that in $^{18}$Mg, indicating the disappearance of the $Z=14$ magic number in $^{20}$Si. Instead, analyses of the many-body configurations and the average occupancies of the mirror states suggest the presence of $dynamic$ TES in low-lying states of $^{19}$Al/$^{19}$C and $^{20}$Si/$^{20}$C. Further evidence is provided by analyzing the contributions of different components of the GSM Hamiltonian. Moreover, this study offers the first theoretical description of $^{20}$Si and guidance for future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a generalised Bohr Hamiltonian formalism together with the Gogny interaction to provide a microscopic input of the required mass parameters, we present the potential energy surface and the evolution of the first excited 2$^+$ state for the gadolinium isotopic chain.
  We observe that the energies and electromagnetic transitions of low-lying states are fairly similar for the various parametrisations and are in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Trapped Fermions Through Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a variational Monte Carlo framework for trapped one-dimensional mixture of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct universal neural-network wavefunction ans\"atze. The method can, in principle, achieve arbitrary accuracy, limited only by the Monte Carlo sampling and was checked against exact results at sub-percent precision. For attractive interactions, it captures pairing effects, and in the impurity case it agrees with known results. We present a method of systematic transfer learning in the number of network parameters, allowing for efficient training for a target precision. We vastly increase the efficiency of the method by incorporating the short-distance behavior of the wavefunction into the ans\"atz without biasing the method.</description>

      <title>The phases of QCD reached in terrestrial and cosmic colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the current state of knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD through lattice, effective field theories, and chiral models. Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.</description>

      <title>Inferring the breakdown scales of the chiral expansions for $g_A$ and $m_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian inference to the order-by-order chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) expansions for the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ and the nucleon mass m_N, and thereby infer the scales at which $\chi$PT breaks down for these two observables. Using a pointwise Bayesian analysis, we find that the inferred breakdown scales are notably different for the two observables. For the chiral expansion of $g_A$, we obtain $251^{+20}_{-50}$ MeV and $211^{+20}_{-30}$ MeV using two distinct sets of low-energy constants, while for the chiral expansion of $m_N$ we infer a significantly larger breakdown scale of $491^{+60}_{-90}$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Photon emission from weakly magnetized neutral pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a hadronic framework, we derive an explicit expression for photon production from neutral pions in a weak background magnetic field. Our calculation is built on the proton triangle diagram with an effective Yukawa $\pi^0$-proton coupling, offering an alternative to quark-level descriptions that is advantageous when the magnetic length greatly exceeds the proton size. Corrections to the pion decay constant are computed up to second order in the magnetic field strength, revealing that the field generally suppresses the decay rate. Quantitatively, however, the effect remains modest even for fields as strong as $|eB|\simeq m_\pi^2$. The differential photon emission rate exhibits anisotropy, with the strongest suppression occurring when the pion momentum is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Overall, the modification of the $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ rate is parametrically small, scaling as $|eB|^2/m_P^4$, where $m_P$ is the proton mass. Nevertheless, under favorable conditions, the resulting angular anisotropy could lead to observable signatures in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Maximally Symmetric Boost-Invariant Solutions of the Boltzmann Equation in Foliated Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the relativistic kinetic theory of a boost-invariant conformal gas on a static, maximally symmetric background $dS_3\times \mathbb{R}$, considering all constant-curvature slicings of $dS_3$ - flat, spherical, or hyperbolic- and their associated symmetry groups. Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Identified charged hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV with the STAR detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results on the production of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC, at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 0.1). Invariant yields of these particles as a function of transverse momentum are shown. We determine bulk properties such as integrated particle yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$), particle ratios, which provide insight into the particle production mechanisms. Additionally, the kinetic freeze-out parameters ($T_\text{kin}$ and $\langle \beta_{T} \rangle$), which provide information about the dynamics of the system at the time of freeze-out, are obtained. The Bjorken energy density ($\epsilon_{BJ}$), which gives an estimate of the energy density in the central rapidity region of the collision zone at the formation time $\tau$, is calculated and presented as a function of multiplicity for various energies. The results are compared with those from the models such as A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) and Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator (HIJING) for further insights.</description>

      <title>Nucleon 3D intrinsic spin structure from the weak-neutral axial-vector form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic 3D weak-neutral axial-vector four-current and spin distributions inside a nucleon (or a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron) including three weak-neutral axial-vector form factors are investigated for the first time. We clarify that the relativistic 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame is completely described by the induced pseudotensor form factor $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than by the axial form factor $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We demonstrate that $R_A \equiv \sqrt{ \frac{-6}{G_A^Z(0) }\frac{\text{d} G_A^Z(Q^2) }{\text{d} Q^2} \Big|_{Q^2=0} }$ can not be interpreted as the physically meaningful 3D root-mean-square axial radius of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron. The genuine axial radius for any spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron in fact does not exist. We also show that the relativistic 3D weak-neutral spin radius $r_\text{spin} = \sqrt{\langle r_\text{spin}^2 \rangle}$, with $\langle r_\text{spin}^2 \rangle \equiv R_A^2 + \frac{ 1 }{ 4M^2 }\left[ 1 + \frac{ 2 G_P^Z(0) }{ G_A^Z(0) } \right]$ based on the relativistic and intrinsic 3D weak-neutral spin distribution in the Breit frame, is a physically meaningful radius that can be unambiguously defined for the nucleon, which provides an additional key motivation for the further determination of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G_P^Z(Q^2)$. Numerically, we find that $R_A \approx 0.6510~\text{fm}$, $r_\text{spin} \approx 2.1054~\text{fm}$ and $\overline r_\text{spin} \equiv r_\text{spin}/3 \approx 0.7018~\text{fm}$. For future experimental measurements of $G_A^Z(Q^2)$ and $G_T^Z(Q^2)$, we also derive the full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections for neutrino-proton and antineutrino-proton elastic scattering in the lab frame, in hoping to provide a complementary and new perspective to unveil the nucleon spin structure by using (anti)neutrino-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Chiral, parity-doublet, effective-Lagrangian mean-field theories for nuclear and astrophysical phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral-parity (parity-doublet) effective Lagrangian models provide a compact and symmetry-consistent framework for describing baryons and their negative-parity partners in terms of linearly-realized chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional, linear, sigma model; the parity-doublet approach accommodates a chirally-invariant mass term, $m_0$, allowing finite baryon-masses even when the chiral condensate melts. This feature enables a unified treatment of hadronic matter across vacuum, nuclear and dense astrophysical regimes. This compact review summarizes the key structures of parity-doublet Lagrangians; outlines the mean-field formulation for nuclear and stellar matter; and highlights recent phenomenological and lattice constraints on the chirally-invariant mass. Emphasis is placed on mirror versus na\"ive chiral assignments; the role of vector interactions in achieving nuclear saturation; and the implications of parity doubling for the equation-of-state of dense matter and neutron-star cooling. The review concludes with current theoretical challenges and perspectives for extending these models beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Chiral transition in a Non-Abelian Quasi-Particle Model with three quark flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the recently introduced Non-Abelian Quasi-Particle Model (NAQPM) for gluons with an ideal Fermi gas of three quark species with the aim to describe the equation of state (energy density vs. temperature) of $2+1$ - flavour Lattice-QCD at zero chemical potential. Allowing temperature dependent masses for the fermions, we show that above a critical temperature $T_c$ the quark mass has to drop rapidly in order to obtain energy density values compatible with the Lattice-QCD results. Within this framework, thus, the restoration of chiral symmetry in the system is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gluon variance -- which is a fundamental quantity of the NAQPM -- is strongly correlated to the fermion mass and decreases by orders of magnitude through the transition. The high temperature phenomenological characteristics of the gluon appear consistent to properties of the perturbative QCD gluon. The model indicates that color deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are interrelated and classical configurations of the QCD dynamics play an important role to the criticality of the system.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes versus potentials in nuclear effective field theory: search for a potential compromise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.08172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In effective field theory physical quantities, in particular observables, are expressed as a power series in terms of a small expansion parameter. For non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the non-perturbative treatment of at least part of the interaction (or the potential, if one is dealing with a non-relativistic system), while the rest of the interaction is included as perturbations. This is not entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schroedinger equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion. Here I explicitly check whether the amplitudes (when expanded according to the counting) are actually following the same power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily conform to expectations and the amplitudes will sometimes violate the power counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables, which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second approach is technically complicated. I explore here the possibility of constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes are indeed expansible in terms of a small expansion parameter.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the spin asymmetry in elastic polarized electron-nucleus collisions at high energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifying the numerical codes, dispersion corrections to the beam-normal spin asymmetry which arise from low-lying transient nuclear excitations up to 30 MeV, are estimated for collision energies between 50 MeV and 1 GeV. A nonperturbative calculation of vacuum polarization and the vertex plus self-energy correction, using optimized potentials, indicates that for small scattering angles both these quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects on the spin asymmetry decrease with energy above 200 MeV and can be neglected at high energies. Examples are given for the 12C and 208Pb nuclei. The available measurements of the spin asymmetry at collision energies beyond 500 MeV cannot be explained by the present theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

Abstract: We present the predictions of various observables for strange ($\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm S}$, $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$)) and multi-strange hadrons ($\Xi^-$($\overline{\Xi}^+$), $\phi$, and $\Omega^-$($\overline{\Omega}^+$)) using the recently updated 3+1D hydrodynamics-based EPOS4 framework and AMPT model. In this study, we report the transverse momentum (${p_{\rm T}}$) spectra, particle yields (${\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y}$), and ${p_{\rm T}}$ integrated yield ratios relative to pions for $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$~TeV. The results reveal that there are indications of stronger radial flow in EPOS4 compared to AMPT. We observe a final state multiplicity overlap with small ($p+p$ and $p+Pb$) and large ($Pb+Pb$) collision systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed form solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude by perturbing on interparticle interaction and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical theoretical inputs for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging only Standard-Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that oscillation analysis results enabled by our data-driven cross-section model approach the theoretical limit achievable with perfect prior knowledge of the cross section. We further quantify the effects of flux shape and detector resolution uncertainties as well as systematics from cross-section mismodeling. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and data-driven cross-section models.</description>

      <title>Event-shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using a multiphase transport model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlations measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations, and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

Abstract: We compute the double differential inclusive spectrum for the emission of a soft gluon from a color-singlet $q\bar q$ pair traversing a dense QCD medium. Our results extend the existing literature by simultaneously incorporating both single hard and multiple soft gluon exchanges between the jet and the medium -- an essential ingredient for a complete phenomenological description of jet quenching. Using the Improved Opacity Expansion framework, we provide an analytically tractable treatment, reducing the full cross-section to a set of simple expressions. Our analysis demonstrates that rare hard (Moli\`ere) scatterings significantly modify the gluon spectrum at large angles, accelerating the loss of color coherence between the initial quarks. We further quantify whether the modifications are driven by an overall weakening of the interference term, or by more detailed modifications to the fragmentation pattern. Our results provide a direct input for phenomenological jet quenching studies, offering new insights into the role of color decoherence in QCD matter.</description>

Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the maximum entropy prescription to determine a quantum state of a small collision system at the kinetic freeze-out. We derive expressions for multiplicity-selected particle momentum spectra and correlation functions by applying a fixed particle number constraint to this state. The results of our analysis can be useful for interpreting the multiplicity dependence of the particle momentum spectra and correlations in high-multiplicity $pp$ collision events at a fixed LHC energy.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>

Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>
