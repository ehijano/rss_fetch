      <title>Realistic wave-optics simulation of X-ray dark-field imaging at a human scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: X-ray dark-field imaging (XDFI) has been explored to provide superior performance over the conventional X-ray imaging for the diagnosis of many pathologic conditions. A simulation tool to reliably predict clinical XDFI images at a human scale, however, is currently missing. Purpose: In this paper, we demonstrate XDFI simulation at a human scale for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Using the developed simulation tool, we demonstrate the strengths and limitations of XDFI for the diagnosis of emphysema, fibrosis, atelectasis, edema, and pneumonia.
  Methods: We augment the XCAT phantom with Voronoi grids to simulate alveolar substructure, responsible for the dark-field signal from lungs, assign material properties to each tissue type, and simulate X-ray wave propagation through the augmented XCAT phantom using a multi-layer wave-optics propagation. Altering the density and thickness of the Voronoi grids as well as the material properties, we simulate XDFI images of normal and diseased lungs.
  Results: Our simulation framework can generate realistic XDFI images of a human chest with normal or diseased lungs. The simulation confirms that the normal, emphysematous, and fibrotic lungs show clearly distinct dark-field signals. It also shows that alveolar fluid accumulation in pneumonia, wall thickening in interstitial edema, and deflation in atelectasis result in a similar reduction in dark-field signal.
  Conclusions: It is feasible to augment XCAT with pulmonary substructure and generate realistic XDFI images using multi-layer wave optics. By providing the most realistic XDFI images of lung pathologies, the developed simulation framework will enable in-silico clinical trials and the optimization of both hardware and software for XDFI.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Index: An Image Quality Metric for Generative Reconstruction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative image reconstruction algorithms such as measurement conditioned diffusion models are increasingly popular in the field of medical imaging. These powerful models can transform low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) inputs into outputs with the appearance of high SNR. However, the outputs can have a new type of error called hallucinations. In medical imaging, these hallucinations may not be obvious to a Radiologist but could cause diagnostic errors. Generally, hallucination refers to error in estimation of object structure caused by a machine learning model, but there is no widely accepted method to evaluate hallucination magnitude. In this work, we propose a new image quality metric called the hallucination index. Our approach is to compute the Hellinger distance from the distribution of reconstructed images to a zero hallucination reference distribution. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a numerical experiment with electron microscopy images, simulated noisy measurements, and applied diffusion based reconstructions. We sampled the measurements and the generative reconstructions repeatedly to compute the sample mean and covariance. For the zero hallucination reference, we used the forward diffusion process applied to ground truth. Our results show that higher measurement SNR leads to lower hallucination index for the same apparent image quality. We also evaluated the impact of early stopping in the reverse diffusion process and found that more modest denoising strengths can reduce hallucination. We believe this metric could be useful for evaluation of generative image reconstructions or as a warning label to inform radiologists about the degree of hallucinations in medical images.</description>

      <title>Virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using darkfield microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gram staining has been one of the most frequently used staining protocols in microbiology for over a century, utilized across various fields, including diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Its manual procedures make it vulnerable to staining errors and artifacts due to, e.g., operator inexperience and chemical variations. Here, we introduce virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using a trained deep neural network that digitally transforms darkfield images of unstained bacteria into their Gram-stained equivalents matching brightfield image contrast. After a one-time training effort, the virtual Gram staining model processes an axial stack of darkfield microscopy images of label-free bacteria (never seen before) to rapidly generate Gram staining, bypassing several chemical steps involved in the conventional staining process. We demonstrated the success of the virtual Gram staining workflow on label-free bacteria samples containing Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua by quantifying the staining accuracy of the virtual Gram staining model and comparing the chromatic and morphological features of the virtually stained bacteria against their chemically stained counterparts. This virtual bacteria staining framework effectively bypasses the traditional Gram staining protocol and its challenges, including stain standardization, operator errors, and sensitivity to chemical variations.</description>
