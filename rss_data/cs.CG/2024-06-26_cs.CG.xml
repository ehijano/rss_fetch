      <title>Outperforming the Best 1D Low-Discrepancy Constructions with a Greedy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of uniformly spread sequences on $[0,1)$ has been extensively studied since the work of Weyl and van der Corput in the early $20^{\text{th}}$ century. The current best sequences are based on the Kronecker sequence with golden ratio and a permutation of the van der Corput sequence by Ostromoukhov. Despite extensive efforts, it is still unclear if it is possible to improve these constructions further. We show, using numerical experiments, that a radically different approach introduced by Kritzinger in seems to perform better than the existing methods. In particular, this construction is based on a \emph{greedy} approach, and yet outperforms very delicate number-theoretic constructions. Furthermore, we are also able to provide the first numerical results in dimensions 2 and 3, and show that the sequence remains highly regular in this new setting.</description>

      <title>LINSCAN -- A Linearity Based Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DBSCAN and OPTICS are powerful algorithms for identifying clusters of points in domains where few assumptions can be made about the structure of the data. In this paper, we leverage these strengths and introduce a new algorithm, LINSCAN, designed to seek lineated clusters that are difficult to find and isolate with existing methods. In particular, by embedding points as normal distributions approximating their local neighborhoods and leveraging a distance function derived from the Kullback Leibler Divergence, LINSCAN can detect and distinguish lineated clusters that are spatially close but have orthogonal covariances. We demonstrate how LINSCAN can be applied to seismic data to identify active faults, including intersecting faults, and determine their orientation. Finally, we discuss the properties a generalization of DBSCAN and OPTICS must have in order to retain the stability benefits of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Faster Approximation Scheme for Euclidean $k$-TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Euclidean $k$-traveling salesman problem ($k$-TSP), we are given $n$ points in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for some fixed constant $d\geq 2$, and a positive integer $k$. The goal is to find a shortest tour visiting at least $k$ points. We give an approximation scheme for the Euclidean $k$-TSP in time $n\cdot 2^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} \cdot(\log n)^{2d^2\cdot 2^d}$. This improves Arora's approximation scheme of running time $n\cdot k\cdot (\log n)^{\left(O\left(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon\right)\right)^{d-1}}$ [J. ACM 1998]. Our algorithm is Gap-ETH tight and can be derandomized by increasing the running time by a factor $O(n^d)$.</description>
