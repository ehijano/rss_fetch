      <title>CFD study on Taylor bubble characteristics in Carreau-Yasuda shear thinning liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, Taylor bubble formation in two-phase gas-non-Newtonian Carreau liquid flowing through a confined co-flow microchannel is investigated. Systematic analysis are carried out to explore the influences of rheological properties, inlet velocities, and surface tension on Taylor bubble length, shape, velocity and liquid film thickness. Aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with different mass concentrations are considered as the non-Newtonian liquids to understand the fundamentals of flow behaviour. With increasing solution viscosity and liquid phase inlet velocity, Taylor bubble formation frequency and velocity increased, however, the bubble length was found to decrease. Velocity profiles inside the Taylor bubble and liquid slug were analyzed, and distinct velocity distributions were found for different CMC concentrations. Flow pattern maps are constructed based on inlet velocities for Carreau liquids in co-flow microchannel. This study essentially provides useful guidelines in designing non-Newtonian microfluidic system for precise control and manipulation of Taylor bubbles.</description>

      <title>Formation characteristics of Taylor bubbles in power-law liquids flowing through a microfluidic co-flow device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation and dynamics of Taylor bubble in power-law liquids flowing through a circular co-flow microchannel are numerically investigated using coupled level set and volume-of-fluid method. Aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide (PAAm) are used as power-law liquids. Influences of PAAm concentration, gas-liquid velocities, and surface tension on bubble characteristics are explored. Various mechanism of bubble breakup are observed in different concentration of PAAm. Based on the bubble length with respect to the channel diameter, two different flow regimes are identified. Flow pattern maps are constructed based on inlet velocities, and scaling laws are proposed to estimate the bubble length.</description>

      <title>HARPPP: Autonomous Geometric Design Optimisation of Stirred Tank Reactor Impellers and Baffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing and optimising the geometry of industrial process equipment remains slow and still largely ad hoc: engineers make small tweaks to one standard shape at a time, build prototypes, and hope for gains. We introduce HARPPP, an autonomous design loop that couples a compact, programmable geometry model to power-controlled CFD and evolutionary search. The geometry model is a single mathematical description that reproduces every standard impeller as a special case while spanning an unlimited set of manufacturable shapes. Working with Johnson Matthey on an industrial vessel, HARPPP explored a 23-parameter impeller-baffle space at constant power (3024 W), executing 3,000 simulation cycles in 15 days. The search uncovered multiple design families that outperform a Rushton/4-baffle baseline in both mixing intensity and uniformity, including twisted-plate impellers and pitched/curved baffles (intensity +18 to +78 percent; uniformity CoV -16 to -64 percent). A clear intensity-uniformity Pareto frontier emerged, enabling application-specific choices. Because HARPPP treats the simulator as the objective, it generalises to other equipment wherever credible physics models exist.</description>

      <title>On a complete analytical solution of transient friction in pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present research is a theoretical study about the transient friction created in circular pipe mean flow, whenever an incompressible Newtonian fluid is accelerated through a monotonously-increased mean-pressure gradient. The resulting friction stress is the sum of two components, one laminar and the other purely turbulent, not synchronised between them. Each component is analysed separately, in a series of theoretical experiments that explore various possibilities, depending on the degree of asynchrony between them. It is found that in some cases the transient friction is higher than in equal-Re steady-sate flow, but in some others it is noticeably lower. This work provides an analytical explanation for most of the important and interesting phenomena reported in the literature. To do so, it takes advantage of the Theory of Underlying Laminar Flow (TULF), already introduced in previous works of same authors. The TULF predicts quite approximately what is observed in experiments, including the transient skin-friction coefficient and the presence of mean-velocity overshoots. Additionally, the role of the time constant in turbulent mean flow is examined and related to the turbulence's frozen time. Finally, a study of the logarithmic layer evolution in the transient flow is accomplished, which results destroyed during the increase of turbulence occurring along the transient. In summary, the present work unveils new knowledge about transient friction in unsteady flows.</description>

      <title>Towards a general characterization of flat fan sprays through Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical investigation of flat fan sprays is conducted via Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). Diverging liquid sheets are generated using tailored initial velocity profiles, where the opening angle serves as an explicit control parameter. The analysis reveals two distinct regimes: at low Weber numbers, the sheet features thick, retracting rims moving at the Taylor-Culick velocity, though rim-driven break-up is not observed without advanced techniques like Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), At high Weber numbers, aerodynamic instabilities govern disintegration, with hole break-up absent in all cases. Representing the spray as a triangular sheet, a simplified model is proposed to predict the axial thickness evolution, showing good agreement with numerical measurements. The study also quantifies the influence of Weber number and opening angle on surface wave properties. An existing break-up length model is successfully applied, incorporating the present initial conditions, offering a predictive tool for future numerical and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Exciting Standing Rossby Waves in the Large Rotating Annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments with rotating tanks remain the premier physical analogue for atmospheric dynamics. Often, the equipment involved is engineered to be sufficiently versatile and modular so as to be able to accommodate experiments that explore a wide range of atmospheric processes. The exercise of initially configuring the apparatus then involves running experiments that sweep through parameter space to identify the specific dynamical regimes of interest. This process is typically considered part of the development and testing phase of a given project, and these initial experiments are generally left unreported; while many of these test experiments may not be directly relevant to the project at hand, they may be useful for other applications or scientific communities. Here we report on a series of 93 different laboratory experiments run with the intention of identifying suitable experimental configurations that excite and sustain standing Rossby waves.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Consequences of Polar Amplification on Standing Rossby Waves: a Laboratory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar amplification describes the predicted reduction in the latitudinal surface temperature gradient, which will have physical implications for mid-latitude dynamics. The precise nature of these dynamical consequences remains unclear. Here we explore aspects of polar amplification by way of 24 distinct idealised laboratory experiments. The apparatus employed can independently prescribe laboratory analogues for the latitudinal temperature gradient ($\Delta{T}$, which controls the stratification $N$), background zonal flow speed ($U_{b}$), and strength of the background gradient in potential vorticity ($\beta$). The ability to control these processes individually is beneficial as decoupling them from one another enables their influences can be examined separately. Reducing the sidewall temperature difference substantially reduces small-scale and high frequency dynamics, but does not affect the large scale features of the flow, including the north-south amplitude of standing meanders. Reducing the zonal flow speed does reduces the length-scales and amplitudes of the standing Rossby waves, while reducing the potential vorticity gradient has the opposite effect; these responses are well described by the canonical expression relating the standing Rossby wavelength to $\sqrt{U_{b}/\beta}$. Variability is partitioned into components that are standing and transient; the response of this variability partitioning depends on all 3 experimental parameters, and a non-dimensional term is developed ($U_{b}\beta/N^{2}$) which captures the behaviour of the variability. These findings suggest that the dynamical consequences of polar amplification is a tendency for mid-latitude weather to shift away from transient storms towards more persistent events, however the zonal wavelength and north-south extent of these persistent events will tend to decrease.</description>

      <title>Heat-Transfer Enhancement by Parametric Sloshing in Horizontal Cylinders: Experiments and EKF-Based Identification of Nusselt Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical forcing of partially filled horizontal cylindrical tanks can induce strong sloshing motion, disrupting thermal stratification between the subcooled liquid and the superheated vapor, and causing significant pressure variations. While this configuration is critical for cryogenic fuel storage in future aircraft and ground transport, its thermodynamic consequences remain poorly characterized. This work presents an experimental investigation of sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylinder under vertical harmonic excitation. Using a hydrofluoroether fluid (3M Novec HFE-7000), decoupled isothermal and non-isothermal campaigns are conducted to characterize the kinematic and thermodynamic responses across various fill levels and forcing amplitudes, near resonance of the first longitudinal symmetric mode $(2,0)$. To quantify the underlying heat and mass transfer processes, a lumped-parameter model is coupled with an Augmented-state Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) to infer time-resolved Nusselt numbers from the experimental data. The results confirm the existence of a critical forcing threshold, below which the fluid remains quiescent and thermally stratified. Above this threshold, parametric resonance triggers strong liquid motion, leading to complete thermal destratification and a rapid pressure drop. At a 50% fill level, the primary jet-like modal response intermittently alternates with a planar $(1,0)$ mode, indicating subharmonic resonance from non-linear mode interactions. The AEKF-based inference reveals that the onset of thermal destratification causes a step-change increase in interfacial and wall Nusselt numbers by several orders of magnitude. Pressure-rate decomposition shows that the pressure evolution is dominated by phase change.</description>

      <title>Statistical State Dynamics of Couette MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The roll streak structure (RSS) is ubiquitous in shear flow turbulence and is fundamental to the dynamics of the self-sustaining process (SSP) maintaining the turbulent state. The formation and maintenance of the RSS in wall-bounded shear flow suggest the presence of an underlying instability that has recently been identified using statistical state dynamics (SSD). Due to the parallelism between the Navier-Stokes equation and the induction equation, it is reasonable to inquire whether the RSS in wall-bounded shear flow has a counterpart in the MHD equations formulated as an SSD. In this work we show that this is the case and that an analytic solution for the composite velocitymagnetic field RSS in the MHD SSD also arises from an instability, that this instability equilibrates to either a fixed point or to a turbulent state, that these turbulent statistical equilibria may be self sustaining, and that both the fixed point and the turbulent states may correspond to large scale coherent dynamos.</description>

      <title>From Interface Dynamics to Darcy Scale Description of Multiphase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outstanding characteristic of porous media, desired in many applications, is the large surface area, which facilitates solid-fluid interactions, making porous media an extreme case in colloid and interface science. In two-fluid systems, wetting and the balance of capillary and viscous forces control fluid displacement processes, leading to a wide range of complex flow regimes with rich spatio-temporal dynamics. Macroscopic two-phase flow is historically described through the phenomenological extensions of Darcy's law. Besides many other shortcomings and inconsistencies, it covers only connected pathway flow in the capillary-dominated flow regime in a rigorous manner while other flow regimes with moving interfaces and associated topological changes are entirely implicit. Given the lack of adequate descriptions, upscaling multiphase flow from pore to Darcy scale represents a long-standing challenge paving into the fields of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and integral geometry. In this review, we compare novel concepts which have been largely motivated by experimental insights, enabled by significant advances in pore-scale imaging and modeling over the last decade.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gauss-Jacobi rules for discrete velocity method in Multiscale Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete velocity method (DVM) is a powerful framework for simulating gas flows across continuum to rarefied regimes, yet its efficiency remains limited by existing quadrature rules. Conventional infinite-domain quadratures, such as Gauss-Hermite, distribute velocity nodes globally and perform well near equilibrium but fail under strong nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast, finite-interval quadratures, such as Newton-Cotes, enable local refinement but lose efficiency near equilibrium. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized Gauss-Jacobi quadrature (GGJQ) for DVM, built upon a new class of adjustable weight functions. This framework systematically constructs one- to three-dimensional quadratures and maps the velocity space into polar or spherical coordinates, enabling flexible and adaptive discretization. The GGJQ accurately captures both near-equilibrium and highly rarefied regimes, as well as low- and high-Mach flows, achieving superior computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Numerical experiments over a broad range of Knudsen numbers confirm that GGJQ consistently outperforms traditional Newton-Cotes and Gauss-Hermite schemes, offering a robust and efficient quadrature strategy for multiscale kinetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact results for dissipation and steady creeping flow in three-dimensional chiral active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active fluids consist of self-spinning particles that rotate as a result of a continuous injection of energy on the microscopic scale (e.g., by activity or an external field). The hydrodynamics of such fluids is described by antisymmetric contributions in the viscosity tensor -called odd viscosity-, which are allowed by symmetry due to the presence of a non-trivial spin angular momentum density. By generalising the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem to systems with odd viscosity, we show that incompressible three-dimensional odd fluids in the presence of sources that induce flow (e.g. surfaces that impose boundary conditions) admit a unique solution for their steady flow fields at low Reynolds number. Furthermore, we prove that such flows dissipate more energy than ordinary Stokes flow, provided that the flow field is affected by odd viscosity. As an example, we consider a model fluid described by one shear viscosity and one odd viscosity in the creeping flow regime. We explicitly compute the stress tensor when such a fluid is subjected to a point force density. Finally, we compute exact results for the pressure and flow fields around a translating and rotating spherical particle from their singularity representations. From these solutions and our extended Helmholtz theorem, we explain why a translating sphere dissipates more energy when odd viscosity is present, whereas a rotating sphere does not.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale topology optimization of porous heat sinks with voided lattice structure using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a topology optimization framework for the design of water cooled heat sinks that incorporate voided lattice structures, formulated using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model. Conventional porous heat sinks often suffer from excessive pressure drops due to their intricate geometries, which limit their practical applicability. To overcome this issue, the proposed method introduces an explicit representation of both void and porous regions, together with graded lattice density, within a multi-material optimization framework. The two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model enables efficient reduced-order simulations, allowing direct consideration of the heterogeneous porous-void distribution during the optimization process. The optimized designs are reconstructed into full-scale lattice geometries and validated through coupled thermo-fluid finite element analyses under fixed pressure-drop conditions. The results demonstrate that the voided lattice configurations significantly outperform conventional plate-fin and uniform lattice heat sinks, achieving approximately 20-30 percent higher maximum Nusselt numbers while maintaining lower pressure losses.</description>

      <title>Classical Euler flows generate the strong Guderley imploding shock wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Guderley's self-similar imploding shock solution for the compressible Euler equations with ideal--gas law ($\gamma&gt;1$) arises from classical, radially symmetric, shock--free data. For such data prescribed at initial time $\mathrm{T_{in}} &lt; 0$, we prove that the flow remains smooth up to a first singular time $t=\mathrm{T}_* \in (\mathrm{T_{in}}, 0)$, where a preshock forms with a $C^{1/3}$ cusp in the fast acoustic variable. From this preshock a unique, initially weak, regular shock is born, whose strength can be made arbitrarily large on a controlled time interval; the front then deforms onto the Guderley shock and implodes at the origin at the collapse time $t=0$. There exists a matching time $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}} \in (\mathrm{T}_*,0)$ such that on $[\mathrm{T_{fin}},0)$ the solution coincides exactly with the classical Guderley self--similar profile, and at $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}}$ the shock trajectory matches the self--similar front to all orders. As $t \to 0^-$, the Euler solution implodes at the center, and continues for $t&gt;0$ as a reflected blast wave, providing a global-in-time unique Euler solution which evolves from regular initial conditions.</description>

Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with mean relative $L_2$ errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure $p$ and velocity components $u_x, u_y$, confirming its reliability. To further enhance physical consistency, we incorporate explicit physics-informed losses based on RANS residuals, including mass and momentum conservation constraints. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, enabling efficient aerodynamic simulations. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in a villi-patterned channel due to pendular-wave activity</title>

Abstract: Inspired by small intestine motility, we investigate the flow induced by a propagating pendular-wave along the walls of a channel lined with rigid, villi-like microstructures. The villi undergo harmonic axial oscillations with a phase lag relative to their neighbours, generating travelling patterns of intervillous contraction. Using two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulations, we resolve the flow within the villi zone and the lumen, sampling small to moderate Womersley numbers. We uncover a mixing boundary layer (MBL) just above the villi, composed of semi-vortical structures that travel with the imposed wave. In the lumen, an axial steady flow emerges, surprisingly oriented opposite to the wave propagation direction, contrary to canonical peristaltic flows. We attribute this flow reversal to the non-reciprocal trajectories of fluid trapped between adjacent villi, and derive a geometric scaling law that captures its magnitude in the Stokes regime. The MBL thickness is found to depend solely on the wave kinematics given by intervillous phase lag in the low-inertia limit. Above a critical threshold, oscillatory inertia induces dynamic confinement, limiting the radial extent of the MBL and leading to non-monotonic behaviour of the axial steady flux. We further develop an effective boundary condition at the villus tips, incorporating both steady and oscillatory components across relevant spatial scales. This framework enables coarse-grained simulations of intestinal flows without resolving individual villi. Our results shed light on the interplay between active microstructure, pendular-wave and finite inertia in biological flows, and suggests new avenues for flow control in biomimetic and microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>'Mic drop': on estimating the size of sub-mm droplets using a simple condenser microphone</title>

Abstract: The size distribution of aerosol droplets is a key parameter in a myriad of processes, and it is typically measured with optical aids (e.g., lasers or cameras) that require sophisticated calibration, thus making the measurement cost intensive. We developed a new method to indirectly measure the size of small droplets using off-the-shelf &lt;\$1 electret microphones. In this method we exploit the natural oscillations that small droplets undergo after impacting a flat surface: by allowing droplets to land directly on a microphone diaphragm, we record the impact force they exert onto it and calculate the complex resonant frequencies of oscillations, from which their size can be inferred. To test this method, we recorded the impact signals of droplets of varying sizes generated by a pipette and extracted the resonant frequencies that characterize each signal. Various sources of uncertainty in the experiments led to a range of frequencies that can characterize each droplet size, and hence a data-driven approach was taken to estimate the size from each set of measured frequencies. We employed a simple setting of neural network and trained it on the frequencies we measured from impact of droplets of prescribed radius. The network was then able to predict the droplet radius in the test group with an average error of 2.7\% and a maximum of 8.6\% relative to the pipette nominal values. These results, achieved with a data set of only 320 measurements, demonstrate the potential for reliable size-distribution measurements via a simple and inexpensive method.</description>

      <title>The early stage of the motion along the gradient of a concentrated vortex structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a rigorous mathematical result, supported by numerical simulations, of the aggregation of a concentrated vortex blob with an underlying non-constant vorticity field: the blob moves in the direction of the gradient of the field. It is a unique example of a Lagrangian explanation of aggregation of vortex structures of the same sign in 2D inviscid fluids. The result is also extended to almost vertical vortex filaments in a (possibly thin) three-dimensional domain.</description>
