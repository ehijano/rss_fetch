      <title>Higher-rank graphs and the graded $K$-theory of Kumjian-Pask Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper lays out the foundations of graded $K$-theory for Leavitt algebras associated with higher-rank graphs, also known as Kumjian-Pask algebras, establishing it as a potential tool for their classification.
  For a row-finite $k$-graph $\Lambda$ without sources, we show that there exists a $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}^k]$-module isomorphism between the graded zeroth (integral) homology $H_0^{gr}(\mathcal{G}_\Lambda)$ of the infinite path groupoid $\mathcal{G}_\Lambda$ and the graded Grothendieck group $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda))$ of the Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$, which respects the positive cones (i.e., the talented monoids).
  We demonstrate that the $k$-graph moves of in-splitting and sink deletion defined by Eckhardt et al. (Canad. J. Math. 2022) preserve the graded $K$-theory of associated Kumjian-Pask algebras and produce algebras which are graded Morita equivalent, thus providing evidence that graded $K$-theory may be an effective invariant for classifying certain Kumjian-Pask algebras.
  We also determine a natural sufficient condition regarding the fullness of the graded Grothendieck group functor. More precisely, for two row-finite $k$-graphs $\Lambda$ and $\Omega$ without sources and with finite object sets, we obtain a sufficient criterion for lifting a pointed order-preserving $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}^k]$-module homomorphism between $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda))$ and $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Omega))$ to a unital graded ring homomorphism between $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$ and $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Omega)$. For this we adapt, in the setting of $k$-graphs, the bridging bimodule technique recently introduced by Abrams, Ruiz and Tomforde (Algebr. Represent. Theory 2024).</description>

      <title>Higher Orbital Integrals on Motion Groups and Mackey Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of cyclic cocycles on Cartan motion groups, which can be viewed as generalizations of orbital integrals. We show that the higher orbital integral on a real reductive group associated with a semisimple element converges to the corresponding one on the associated Cartan motion group.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics, higher Kazhdan projections and delocalised $\ell^2$-Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-amenable finitely generated virtually free groups, we show that the combinatorial Euler characteristic introduced by Emerson and Meyer is the preimage of the K-theory class of higher Kazhdan projections under the Baum-Connes assembly map. This allows to represent the K-theory class of their higher Kazhdan projection as a finite alternating sum of the K-theory classes of certain averaging projections. The latter is associated to the finite subgroups appearing in the fundamental domain of their Bass-Serre tree. As an immediate application we obtain non-vanishing calculations for delocalised $\ell^2$-Betti numbers for this class of groups.</description>

      <title>On algebraic vector bundles of rank $2$ over smooth affine fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of algebraic vector bundles of rank 2 over smooth affine fourfolds is a notoriously difficult problem. Isomorphism classes of such vector bundles are not uniquely determined by their Chern classes, in contrast to the situation in lower dimensions. Given a smooth affine fourfold over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not equal to $2$ or $3$, we study cohomological criteria for finiteness of the fibers of the Chern class map for rank $2$ bundles. As a consequence, we give a cohomological classification of such bundles in a number of cases. For example, if $d\leq 4$, there are precisely $d^2$ non-isomorphic algebraic vector bundles over the complement of a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb P^4_{\mathbb C}$.</description>

      <title>Foliations and stable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is part of an ongoing series of works on the study of foliations on algebraic varieties via derived algebraic geometry. We focus here on the specific case of globally defined vector fields and the global behaviour of their algebraic integral curves. For a smooth and proper variety $X$ with a global vector field $\nu$, we consider the induced vector field $\nu_{g,n}$ on the derived stack of stable maps, of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, to $X$. When $(g,n)$ is either $(0,2)$ or $(1,0)$, the derived stack of zeros of $\nu_{g,n}$ defines a proper \emph{moduli of algebraic trajectories} of $\nu$. When $(g,n)=(0,2)$ algebraic trajectories behave very much like rational algebraic paths from one zero of $\nu$ to another, and in particular they can be composed. This composition is represented by the usual gluing maps in Gromov-Witten theory, and we use it give three categorical constructions, of different categorical levels, related, in a certain sense, by decategorification. In order to do this, in particular, we have to deal with virtual fundamental classes of non-quasi-smooth derived stacks. When $(g,n)=(1,0)$, zeros of $\nu_{1,0}$ might be thought as algebraic analogues of periodic orbits of vector fields on smooth real manifolds. In particular, we propose a Zeta function counting the zeros of $\nu_{1,0}$, that we like to think of as an algebraic version of Ruelle's dynamical Zeta function. We conclude the paper with a brief indication on how to extend these results to the case of general one dimensional foliation $F$, by considering the derived stack of $F$-equivariant stable maps.</description>
