      <title>A multi-frequency spaceborne radar perspective of deep convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global numerical weather models are starting to resolve atmospheric moist convection which comes with a critical need for observational constraints. One avenue for such constraints is spaceborne radar which tend to operate at three wavelengths, Ku-, Ka- and W-band. Many studies of deep convection in the past have primarily leveraged Ku-band because it is less affected by attenuation and multiple scattering. However, future spaceborne radar missions might not contain a Ku-band radar and thus considering the view of convection from Ka-band or W-band compared to the Ku-band would be useful. This study examines a coincident dataset between the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission and CloudSat as well as the entire GPM record to compare convective characteristics across various wavelengths within deep convection. We find that W-band reflectivity (Z) tends to maximize near the Ku-band defined echo-top while Ka-band often maximizes 4-5 km below. The height of the maximum Z above the melting level for W-band and Ka-band do not linearly relate to the Ku-band maximum. However, using the full GPM record the Ka-band 30 dBZ echo-tops can be linearly related to the Ku-band 40 dBZ echo-top with an $R^2$ of 0.62 and a root mean squared error of about 1 km. The spatial distribution of echo-tops from Ka-band corresponds well to the Ku-band echo-tops, highlighting regions of relatively large ice water path. This paper suggests that Ka-band only missions, like NASA's Investigation for Convective Updrafts, should be able to characterize global convection in a similar manner to a Ku-band system.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-enabled machine learning for emulation of regional sea-level change caused by the Antarctic Ice Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projecting sea-level change in various climate-change scenarios typically involves running forward simulations of the Earth's gravitational, rotational and deformational (GRD) response to ice mass change, which requires high computational cost and time. Here we build neural-network emulators of sea-level change at 27 coastal locations, due to the GRD effects associated with future Antarctic Ice Sheet mass change over the 21st century. The emulators are based on datasets produced using a numerical solver for the static sea-level equation and published ISMIP6-2100 ice-sheet model simulations referenced in the IPCC AR6 report. We show that the neural-network emulators have an accuracy that is competitive with baseline machine learning emulators. In order to quantify uncertainty, we derive well-calibrated prediction intervals for simulated sea-level change via a linear regression postprocessing technique that uses (nonlinear) machine learning model outputs, a technique that has previously been applied to numerical climate models. We also demonstrate substantial gains in computational efficiency: a feedforward neural-network emulator exhibits on the order of 100 times speedup in comparison to the numerical sea-level equation solver that is used for training.</description>

      <title>Generative Data Assimilation of Sparse Weather Station Observations at Kilometer Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation of observational data into full atmospheric states is essential for weather forecast model initialization. Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10\% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneity-induced wavenumber diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertia-gravity waves are scattered by background flows as a result of Doppler shift by a non-uniform velocity. In the WKB regime, the scattering process reduces to a diffusion in spectral space. Other inhomogeneities the waves encounter, such as density variations, also cause scattering and spectral diffusion. We generalise the spectral diffusion equation to account for these inhomogeneities. We apply the result to the rotating shallow water system, for which height inhomogeneities arise from velocity inhomogeneities through geostrophy, and to the Boussinesq system for which buoyancy inhomogeneities arise similarly. We compare the contributions that height and buoyancy variations make to the spectral diffusion with the contribution of the Doppler shift. In both systems, we find regimes where all contributions are significant. We support our findings with exact solutions of the diffusion equation and with ray tracing simulations in the shallow water case.</description>

      <title>Identifying Lightning Processes in ERA5 Soundings with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric environments favorable for lightning and convection are commonly represented by proxies or parameterizations based on expert knowledge such as CAPE, wind shears, charge separation, or combinations thereof. Recent developments in the field of machine learning, high resolution reanalyses, and accurate lightning observations open possibilities for identifying tailored proxies without prior expert knowledge. To identify vertical profiles favorable for lightning, a deep neural network links ERA5 vertical profiles of cloud physics, mass field variables and wind to lightning location data from the Austrian Lightning Detection and Information System (ALDIS), which has been transformed to a binary target variable labelling the ERA5 cells as cells with lightning activity and cells without lightning activity. The ERA5 parameters are taken on model levels beyond the tropopause forming an input layer of approx. 670 features. The data of 2010-2018 serve as training/validation. On independent test data, 2019, the deep network outperforms a reference with features based on meteorological expertise. SHAP values highlight the atmospheric processes learned by the network which identifies cloud ice and snow content in the upper and mid-troposphere as very relevant features. As these patterns correspond to the separation of charge in thunderstorm cloud, the deep learning model can serve as physically meaningful description of lightning. Depending on the region, the neural network also exploits the vertical wind or mass profiles to correctly classify cells with lightning activity.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric models for realizing specified changes in subsequent forecasts. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The sensitivity matrix is used to solve the inverse problem as convex optimization, in which a global optimal solution can be found computationally efficiently. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using an NWP model. The experiments showed that identified perturbation successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation. These results demonstrated the possibility of controlling the real atmosphere by solving inverse problems and adding small perturbations to atmospheric states.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Stochastic Bias Correction using a Machine Learning Attention model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14169v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models are biased with respect to real-world observations. They usually need to be adjusted before being used in impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such adjustments is called bias correction (BC). However, BC methods currently struggle to adjust temporal biases. Because they mostly disregard the dependence between consecutive time points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately. This makes it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. This paper offers a novel BC methodology to correct temporal biases. This is made possible by rethinking the philosophy behind BC. We will introduce BC as a time-indexed regression task with stochastic outputs. Rethinking BC enables us to adapt state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) attention models and thereby learn different types of biases, including temporal asynchronicities. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show more accurate results than current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</description>
