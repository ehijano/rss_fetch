      <title>Advancements in Constitutive Model Calibration: Leveraging the Power of Full-Field DIC Measurements and In-Situ Load Path Selection for Reliable Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate material characterization and model calibration are essential for computationally-supported engineering decisions. Current characterization and calibration methods (1) use simplified test specimen geometries and global data, (2) cannot guarantee that sufficient characterization data is collected for a specific model of interest, (3) use deterministic methods that provide best-fit parameter values with no uncertainty quantification, and (4) are sequential, inflexible, and time-consuming. This work brings together several recent advancements into an improved workflow called Interlaced Characterization and Calibration that advances the state-of-the-art in constitutive model calibration. The ICC paradigm (1) efficiently uses full-field data to calibrate a high-fidelity material model, (2) aligns the data needed with the data collected with an optimal experimental design protocol, (3) quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and (4) incorporates these advances into a quasi real-time feedback loop. The ICC framework is demonstrated on the calibration of a material model using simulated full-field data for an aluminum cruciform specimen being deformed bi-axially. The cruciform is actively driven through the myopically optimal load path using Bayesian optimal experimental design, which selects load steps that yield the maximum expected information gain. To aid in numerical stability and preserve computational resources, the full-field data is dimensionally reduced via principal component analysis, and fast surrogate models which approximate the input-output relationships of the expensive finite element model are used. The tools demonstrated here show that high-fidelity constitutive models can be efficiently and reliably calibrated with quantified uncertainty, thus supporting credible decision-making and potentially increasing the agility of solid mechanics modeling.</description>

      <title>EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting incorporating Text Mining Based on Pre-trained Language Models and Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for EUR/USD exchange rate forecasting that integrates deep learning, textual analysis, and particle swarm optimization (PSO). By incorporating online news and analysis texts as qualitative data, the proposed PSO-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional econometric and machine learning models. The research employs advanced text mining techniques, including sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa-Large model and topic modeling with LDA. Empirical findings underscore the significant advantage of incorporating textual data, with the PSO-LSTM model outperforming benchmark models such as SVM, SVR, ARIMA, and GARCH. Ablation experiments reveal the contribution of each textual data category to the overall forecasting performance. The study highlights the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in finance and paves the way for future research in real-time forecasting and the integration of alternative data sources.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based retrieval models for hyperspectral image data optimized with Kernel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based statistical methods are efficient, but their performance depends heavily on the selection of kernel parameters. In literature, the optimization studies on kernel-based chemometric methods is limited and often reduced to grid searching. Previously, the authors introduced Kernel Flows (KF) to learn kernel parameters for Kernel Partial Least-Squares (K-PLS) regression. KF is easy to implement and helps minimize overfitting. In cases of high collinearity between spectra and biogeophysical quantities in spectroscopy, simpler methods like Principal Component Regression (PCR) may be more suitable. In this study, we propose a new KF-type approach to optimize Kernel Principal Component Regression (K-PCR) and test it alongside KF-PLS. Both methods are benchmarked against non-linear regression techniques using two hyperspectral remote sensing datasets.</description>

      <title>Application of an ANN and LSTM-based Ensemble Model for Stock Market Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock trading has always been a key economic indicator in modern society and a primary source of profit for financial giants such as investment banks, quantitative trading firms, and hedge funds. Discovering the underlying patterns within the seemingly volatile yet intrinsically structured economic activities has become a central focus of research for many companies. Our study leverages widely-used modern financial forecasting algorithms, including LSTM, ANN, CNN, and BiLSTM. We begin by comparing the predictive performance of these well-known algorithms on our stock market data, utilizing metrics such as R2, MAE, MSE, RMSE for detailed evaluation. Based on the performance of these models, we then aim to combine their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses, striving to construct a powerful hybrid model that overcomes the performance limitations of individual models.Through rigorous experimentation and exploration, we ultimately developed an LSTM+ANN model that breaks through prior performance bottlenecks, achieving promising and exciting results.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for the Electric Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</description>
