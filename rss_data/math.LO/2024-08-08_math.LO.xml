      <title>On the limits of comparing subset sizes within $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and compare five ways of assigning totally ordered sizes to subsets of the natural numbers: cardinality, infinite lottery logic with mirror cardinalities, natural density, generalised density, and $\alpha$-numerosity. Generalised densities and $\alpha$-numerosities lack uniqueness, which can be traced to intangibles: objects that can be proven to exist in ZFC while no explicit example of them can be given. As a sixth and final formalism, we consider a recent proposal by \citet{Trlifajova:2024}, which we call c-numerosity. It is fully constructive and uniquely determined, but assigns merely partially ordered numerosity values. By relating all six formalisms to each other in terms of the underlying limit operations, we get a better sense of the intrinsic limitations in determining the sizes of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>On Namba Forcing and Minimal Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on a 1990 paper of Bukovsky and Coplakova-Hartova. First, we remove the hypothesis of $\textsf{CH}$ from one of their minimality results. Then, using a measurable cardinal, we show that there is a $|\aleph_2^V|=\aleph_1$-minimal extension that is not a $|\aleph_3^V|=\aleph_1$-extension, answering the first of their questions.</description>

      <title>Elements of affine model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By Lindstr\"{o}m's theorems, the expressive power of first order logic (and similarly continuous logic) is not strengthened without losing some interesting property. Weakening it, is however less harmless and has been payed attention by some authors. Affine continuous logic is the fragment of continuous logic obtained by avoiding the connectives $\wedge,vee$. This reduction leads to the affinization of most basic tools and technics of continuous logic such as the ultraproduct construction, compactness theorem, type, saturation etc. The affine variant of the ultraproduct construction is the ultramean construction where ultrafilters are replaced with maximal finitely additive probability measures. A consequence of this relaxation is that compact structures with at least two elements have now proper elementary extensions. In particular, they have non-categorical theories in the new setting. Thus, a model theoretic framework for study of such structures is provided. A more remarkable aspect of this logic is that the type spaces are compact convex sets. The extreme types then play a crucial role in the study of affine theories. In this text, we present the foundations of affine continuous model theory.</description>

      <title>Smart Health Software to Support Rescue Personnel in Emergency Situations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rescue stations around the world receive millions of emergency rescue calls each year, most of which are due to health complications. Due to the high frequency and necessity of rescue services, there is always an increasing demand for quick, accurate, and coordinated responses from rescue personnel to save lives and mitigate damage. This paper introduces a rescue health management software solution designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rescue situational awareness by rapidly assessing the health status of emergency patients using AI-driven decision support systems. The novelty in this software approach is it's user-centered design principles to ensure that its solutions are specifically tailored to meet the unique requirements of emergency responders. It used pre-trained machine learning models with rescue data and accepted new patient's input data to provide a probability of the major health complications so that rescue personnel can expedite treatment plan following the outcome. The paper focuses primarily on the software development and implementation steps with three use cases, while also providing a short overview of the previous machine learning-based development phases.</description>

      <title>Artifical intelligence and inherent mathematical difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship of artificial intelligence to the task of resolving open questions in mathematics. We first present an updated version of a traditional argument that limitative results from computability and complexity theory show that proof discovery is an inherently difficult problem. We then illustrate how several recent applications of artificial intelligence-inspired methods -- respectively involving automated theorem proving, SAT-solvers, and large language models -- do indeed raise novel questions about the nature of mathematical proof. We also argue that the results obtained by such techniques do not tell against our basic argument. This is so because they are embodiments of brute force search and are thus capable of deciding only statements of low logical complexity.</description>

      <title>Additivity of derived limits in the Cohen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in the model constructed by adding sufficiently many Cohen reals, derived limits are additive on a large class of systems. This generalizes the work of Jeffrey Bergfalk, Michael Hru\v s\'ak, and Chris Lambie-Hanson which focuses on the system $\mathbf{A}$. In the process, we isolate a partition principle responsible for the vanishing of derived limits on collections of Cohen reals and reframe the propagating trivializations result of as a theorem of ZFC. In light of results of the author, Jeffrey Bergfalk, and Justin Moore in \cite{ASH}, the additivity of derived limits also implies additivity results for strong homology.</description>

      <title>Soft-linkedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have revised the softness property introduced by J\"org Brendle and Haim Judah (perfect sets of random reals. Israel J. Math., 83(1-2):153-176, 1993), to present a new definition of a class of posets called $\sigma$-soft-linked. Our work demonstrates that these posets work well to preserve the evasion number as well as the bounding number small in generic extensions. Furthermore, we establish a connection between our concept and the Fr\'echet-linked notion introduced by Diego A. Mej\'ia (Matrix iterations with vertical support restrictions. In Proceedings of the 14th1 and 15th Asian Logic Conferences, pages 213-248. World Sci. Publ., Hackensack, NJ, 2019).</description>
