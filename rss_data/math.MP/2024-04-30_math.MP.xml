      <title>Two-level adiabatic transition probability for small avoided crossings generated by tangential intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm effect and superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path-integral technique in quantum mechanics provides an intuitive framework for comprehending particle propagation and scattering. Calculating the propagator for the Aharonov-Bohm potential fits into the range of potentials in multiply-connected spaces, with the propagator represented through a series expansion. In this paper, we analyze the Schr\"odinger evolution of superoscillations, showing the supershift properties of the solution to the Schr\"odinger equation for this potential. Our proof is based on the continuity of particular infinite order differential operators acting on spaces of entire functions.</description>

      <title>Localizability in de Sitter space for 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extended the notion of Newton-Wigner localization, already constructed in the bi-dimensional de Sitter space, to the tri-dimensional case for both principal and complementary series. We identify the one-particle subspace, generated by the positive-energy modes solution of the Klein-Gordon equation, as an irreducible representation of the de Sitter group. The time-evolution of the Newton-Wigner operator was obtained explicitly, and for the complementary series the evolution is trivial, i.e., there are no dynamics. Also, we discussed heuristically the existing sign ambiguity when we do not require as a postulate that the Newton-Wigner functions must be proportional to their respective solutions in the representation of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>Power laws and logarithmic oscillations in diffusion processes on infinite countable ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that if the initial condition of the Cauchy problem for the diffusion equation on a general infinite countable ultrametric space is spherically symmetric with respect to some point, then this problem has an exact analytical solution. A general solution of this problem is presented for pure ultrametric diffusion, as well as for ultrametric diffusion with a reaction sink concentrated at the center of spherical symmetry. Conditions on the ultrametric and the distribution of the number of states in ultrametric spheres are found that lead at large times to the asymptotic behavior of the solutions obtained in the form of a power law modulated by a bounded function that is log-periodic under some additional conditions.</description>

      <title>Harmonic locus and Calogero-Moser spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the harmonic locus consisting of the monodromy-free Schr\"odinger operators with rational potential and quadratic growth at infinity. It is known after Oblomkov that it can be identified with the set of all partitions via the Wronskian map for Hermite polynomials. We show that the harmonic locus can also be identified with the subset of the Calogero--Moser space introduced by Wilson, which is fixed by the symplectic action of $\mathbb C^\times.$ As a corollary, for the multiplicity-free part of the locus we effectively solve the inverse problem for the Wronskian map by describing the partition in terms of the spectrum of the corresponding Moser matrix. We also compute the characters of the $\mathbb C^\times$-action at the fixed points, proving, in particular, a conjecture of Conti and Masoero.</description>

      <title>Exact Analytical Solution of the Flory-Huggins Model and Extensions to Multicomponent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Flory-Huggins theory describes the phase separation of solutions containing polymers. Although it finds widespread application from polymer physics to materials science to biology, the concentrations that coexist in separate phases at equilibrium have not been determined analytically, and numerical techniques are required that restrict the theory's ease of application. In this work, we derive an implicit analytical solution to the Flory-Huggins theory of one polymer in a solvent by applying a procedure that we call the implicit substitution method. While the solutions are implicit and in the form of composite variables, they can be mapped explicitly to a phase diagram in composition space. We apply the same formalism to multicomponent polymeric systems, where we find analytical solutions for polydisperse mixtures of polymers of one type. Finally, while complete analytical solutions are not possible for arbitrary mixtures, we propose computationally efficient strategies to map out coexistence curves for systems with many components of different polymer types.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of the ballistic-conductive model of heat conduction: the reverse side of the coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van, Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread anywhere.</description>

      <title>Overtones of black holes via time-domain integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that first several overtones could calculated by the time-domain integration method for asymptotically de Sitter black holes already at the lowest multipole numbers of gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. This is not possible for asymptotically flat black holes, for which extraction of frequencies with the Prony method is usually possible with reasonable accuracy only for the fundamental mode. The reason for much better efficiency in the de Sitter case is absence of power-law tails: the quasinormal modes dominate the signal not only at the intermediate stage, but also at asymptotically late times.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of capacitors.</description>

      <title>Implicit Update of the Moment Equations for a Multi-Species, Homogeneous BGK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple iterative approach for solving a set of implicit kinetic moment equations is proposed. This implicit solve is a key component in the IMEX discretization of the multi-species Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (M-BGK) model with nontrivial collision frequencies depending on individual species temperatures. We prove that under mild time step restrictions, the iterative method generates a contraction mapping. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate results of the IMEX scheme using the implicit moment solver.</description>

As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine Yangian to some cosets of non-rectangular $W$-algebras.</description>

      <title>On some linear equations associated with dispersionless integrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a recently proposed scheme of matrix extension of dispersionless integrable systems for the Abelian case, in which it leads to linear equations, connected with the initial dispersionless system. In the examples considered, these equations can be interpreted in terms of Abelian gauge fields on the geometric background defined by the dispersionless system. They are also connected with the linearisation of initial systems. We construct solutions to these linear equations in terms of wave functions of the Lax pair for dispersionless system, which is represented in terms of some vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We produce examples of solutions to the non-abelian gravitating vortex equations, which are a dimensional reduction of the K\"aher-Yang-Mills- Higgs equations. These are equations for a K\"ahler metric and a metric on a vector bundle. We consider a symmetric situation on a sphere with a relationship between the parameters involved (criticality), and perform a non-trivial reduction of the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations on the real line with complicated boundary conditions at infinity. This system involves a parameter whose dependence on the volume of the K\"ahler metric is non-explicit. We prove existence to this system using the method of continuity. We then prove that the parameter can be varied to make sure that all possible admissible volumes are attained.</description>

      <title>Gordan-Rankin-Cohen operators on superstrings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We distinguish two classifications of bidifferential operators: between (A) spaces of modular forms and (B) spaces of weighted densities.
  (A) The invariant under the projective action of $\text{SL}(2;\mathbb{Z})$ binary differential operators between spaces of modular forms of integer or half-integer weight on the 1-dimensional manifold were found by Gordan (called transvectants), rediscovered and classified by Rankin and Cohen (called brackets), and, in still another context, by Janson and Peetre. The invariant under the algebraic supergroup $\text{OSp}(1|2; \mathbb{Z})$ super modular forms of integer and half-integer weight on $(1|1)$-dimensional superstrings with contact structure were introduced, bidifferential operators between them classified and further studied by Gieres-Theisen, Cohen-Manin-Zagier, and Gargoubi-Ovsienko.
  (B) For any complex weights, we classify the analogs of Gordan-Rankin-Cohen (briefly: GRC) binary differential operators between spaces of weighted densities invariant under $\mathfrak{pgl}(2)$. For any complex weights, we classify the analogs of GRC-operators between spaces of weighted densities invariant under the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. In the case of $(1|1)$-dimensional superstring without any additional structure, we also classify the analogs of GRC-operators between spaces of any weighted densities invariant under the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{pgl}(1|2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrability of two-dimensional theories that are obtained by a dimensional reduction of certain four-dimensional gravitational theories describing the coupling of Maxwell fields and neutral scalar fields to gravity in the presence of a potential for the neutral scalar fields. By focusing on a certain solution subspace, we show that a subset of the equations of motion in two dimensions are the compatibility conditions for a modified version of the Breitenlohner-Maison linear system. Subsequently, we study the Liouville integrability of the 2D models encoding the chosen 4D solution subspace from a one-dimensional point of view by constructing Lax pair matrices. In this endeavour, we successfully employ a linear neural network to search for Lax pair matrices for these models, thereby illustrating how machine learning approaches can be effectively implemented to augment the identification of integrable structures in classical systems.</description>

      <title>A Universal Kinematical Group for Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1968, Dashen and Sharp obtained a certain singular Lie algebra of local densities and currents from canonical commutation relations in nonrelativistic quantum field theory. The corresponding Lie group is infinite dimensional: the natural semidirect product of an additive group of scalar functions with a group of diffeomorphisms. Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities; notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics. We also consider the relationship of our development to Heisenberg quantization.</description>

      <title>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion. This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule", which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

      <title>Interface motion from Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics of non-gradient type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on a $d$-dimensional periodic lattice of size $N$, that is, a stochastic time evolution of particles performing random walks with interaction subject to the exclusion rule (Kawasaki part), in general, of non-gradient type, together with the effect of the creation and annihilation of particles (Glauber part) whose rates are set to favor two levels of particle density, called sparse and dense. We then study the limit of our dynamics under the hydrodynamic space-time scaling, that is, $1/N$ in space and a diffusive scaling $N^2$ for the Kawasaki part and another scaling $K=K(N)$, which diverges slower, for the Glauber part in time. In the limit as $N\to\infty$, we show that the particles autonomously make phase separation into sparse or dense phases at the microscopic level, and an interface separating two regions is formed at the macroscopic level and evolves under an anisotropic curvature flow.
  In the present article, we show that the particle density at the macroscopic level is well approximated by a solution of a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear diffusion term of divergence form and a large reaction term. Furthermore, by applying the results of Funaki, Gu and Wang [arXiv:2404.12234] for the convergence rate of the diffusion matrix approximated by local functions, we obtain a quantitative hydrodynamic limit as well as the upper bound for the allowed diverging speed of $K=K(N)$.
  The above result for the derivation of the interface motion is proved by combining our result with that in a companion paper by Funaki and Park [arXiv:2403.01732], in which we analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reaction-diffusion equation obtained in the present article and derived an anisotropic curvature flow in the situation where the macroscopic reaction term determined from the Glauber part is bistable and balanced.</description>

      <title>Integrable semi-discretization for a modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, an integrable semi-discretization of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with cubic nonlinearity is presented. The key points of the construction are based on the discrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and appropriate definition of discrete reciprocal transformations. First, we demonstrate that these bilinear equations and their determinant solutions can be derived from the discrete KP equation through Miwa transformation and some reductions. Then, by scrutinizing the reduction process, we obtain a set of semi-discrete bilinear equations and their general soliton solutions in the Gram-type determinant form. Finally, we obtain an integrable semi-discrete analog of the mCH equation by introducing dependent variables and discrete reciprocal transformation. It is also shown that the semi-discrete mCH equation converges to the continuous one in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Collapse in Painleve-Gullstrand Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a family of self-similar exact solutions in General Relativity. The solutions are found in a Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system but can also be transformed smoothly into a diagonal form. The solutions represent a gravitational collapse leading to three possible outcomes, depending on the parameter space : (i) a collapse followed by a bounce and dispersal of the clustered matter distribution, (ii) a rapid collapse followed by a bounce and an eventual re-collapse, and (iii) a standard collapse leading to zero proper volume. Profiles of the energy conditions are studied for all of the scenarios, and it is noted that a bounce is usually associated with a violation of the Null Energy Condition. It is found that more than one null surfaces (apparent horizons) can develop during the collapse. We also discuss that for a general metric tensor having a conformal symmetry, some regions of the parameter space allows a formation of null throat, much like a wormhole. Matching the metric with a Schwarzschild metric in Painleve-Gullstrand form leads to the geodesic equation for a zero energy falling particle in the exterior.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relation and the constrained quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty relation is a fundamental concept in quantum theory, plays a pivotal role in various quantum information processing tasks. In this study, we explore the additive uncertainty relation pertaining to two or more observables, in terms of their variance,by utilizing the generalized Gell-Mann representation in qudit systems. We find that the tight state-independent lower bound of the variance sum can be characterized as a quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints in optimization theory. As illustrative examples, we derive analytical solutions for these quadratic programming problems in lower-dimensional systems, which align with the state-independent lower bounds. Additionally, we introduce a numerical algorithm tailored for solving these quadratic programming instances, highlighting its efficiency and accuracy. The advantage of our approach lies in its potential ability to simultaneously achieve the optimal value of the quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints but also precisely identify the extremal state where this optimal value is attained. This enables us to establish a tight state-independent lower bound for the sum of variances, and further identify the extremal state at which this lower bound is realized.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of two dimensional gravity models using ideas motivated by the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. This leads to a rather natural formulation of a theory that has close links with Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. After introducing the theory and discussing its vacuum solutions, we present the Hamiltonian analysis. This implies the presence of a single dynamical degree of freedom, which is in sharp contrast to General Relativity, where there are no degrees of freedom in two spacetime dimensions. Our approach can be extended to various other lower-dimensional gravity theories and thus could be of wider interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plasma dispersion function $Z(s)$ is a fundamental complex special integral function widely used in the field of plasma physics. The simplest and most rapid, yet accurate, approach to calculating it is through rational or equivalent multi-pole expansions. In this work, we summarize the numerical coefficients that are practically useful to the community. Besides the Pade approximation to obtain coefficients, which are accurate for both small and large arguments, we also employ optimization methods to enhance the accuracy of the approximation for the intermediate range. The best coefficients provided here for calculating $Z(s)$ can deliver twelve significant decimal digits. This work serves as a foundational database for the community for further applications.</description>

Abstract: In this study we develop a mathematical model that describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and heat transfer in closed electrical contacts that arises when instantaneous explosion of the micro-asperity which involves vaporization zone and liquid, solid zones where temperature is defined by a generalized heat equation with Thomson effect. This model account for the nonlinear nature of the thermal coefficients and electrical conductivity depended on temperature. Our proposed solutions are based on similarity transformation which allows us to reduce a Stefan-type problem to a system of nonlinear integral equations whose existence of solution is proved by the fixed point theory in Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general black box theorem that ensures convergence of a sequence of stationary Markov processes, provided a few assumptions are satisfied. This theorem relies on a control of the resolvents of the sequence of Markov processes, and on a suitable characterization of the resolvents of the limit. One major advantage of this approach is that it circumvents the use of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: in particular, we deduce in a rather simple way that the stationary fluctuations of the one-dimensional zero-range process converge to the stochastic heat equation. It also allows to establish results that were probably out of reach of existing methods: using the black box result, we are able to prove that the stationary fluctuations of a discrete model of ordered interfaces, that was considered previously in the statistical physics literature, converge to a system of reflected stochastic PDEs.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and retrieving information from quantum computers. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, that allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage process. This type of measurements significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design feasible setup preparation procedure that produce well-approximated cyclic tight measurements, in every finite dimension.</description>

Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_\star(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of invertible symmetry, the topological approach based on classifying spaces dominates the classification of 't Hooft anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases. In contrast, except for discrete 0-form symmetry, a systematic algebraic approach based on cochains remains poorly explored. In this work, we investigate the systematic algebraic approach for discrete higher-form symmetry with a trivial higher-group structure. Studying the discrete formulation of invertible field theories in arbitrary dimension, we extract a purely algebraic structure that we call extended group cohomology, which directly characterizes and classifies the lattice lagrangian of invertible field theories and the behavior of anomalous topological operators. Using techniques from simplicial homotopy theory, we prove the isomorphism between extended group cohomology and cohomology of classifying spaces. The proof is based on an explicit construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and their products. Our findings also clarify the discrete formulation of a class of generalized Dijkgraaf-Witten-Yetter models.</description>

Abstract: A methodology for deriving dual variational principles for the classical Newtonian mechanics of mass points in the presence of applied forces, interaction forces, and constraints, all with a general dependence on particle velocities and positions, is presented. Methods for incorporating constraints are critically assessed. General theory, as well as explicitly worked out variational principles for a dissipative system (due to Lorenz) and a system with anholonomic constraints (due to Pars) are demonstrated. Conditions under which a (family of) dual Hamiltonian flow(s), as well as a constant(s) of motion, may be associated with a conservative or dissipative, and possibly constrained, primal system naturally emerge in this work.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity III: Early-Time Asymptotics for Higher $\ell$-Modes of Linear Waves on a Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00035v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the early-time asymptotics for fixed-frequency solutions $\phi_\ell$ to the wave equation $\Box_g \phi_\ell=0$ on a fixed Schwarzschild background ($M&gt;0$) arising from the no incoming radiation condition on $\mathcal I^-$ and polynomially decaying data, $r\phi_\ell\sim t^{-1}$ as $t\to-\infty$, on either a timelike boundary of constant area radius (I) or an ingoing null hypersurface (II). In case (I), we show that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ along outgoing null hypersurfaces near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms at order $r^{-3-\ell}\log r$. In contrast, in case (II), we obtain that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms already at order $r^{-3}\log r$ (unless $\ell=1$).
  These results suggest an alternative approach to the study of late-time asymptotics near future timelike infinity $i^+$ that does not assume conformally smooth or compactly supported Cauchy data: In case (I), our results indicate logarithmic modifications to Price's law for each $\ell$-mode. On the other hand, the data of case (II) lead to much stronger deviations from Price's law. In particular, we conjecture that compactly supported scattering data on $\mathcal H^-$ and $\mathcal I^-$ lead to solutions that exhibit the same late-time asymptotics on $\mathcal I^+$ for each $\ell$: $r\phi_\ell|_{\mathcal I^+}\sim u^{-2}$ as $u\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: The importance of the quantum Fisher information metric is testified by the number of applications that this has in very different fields, ranging from hypothesis testing to metrology, passing through thermodynamics. Still, from the rich range of possible quantum Fisher information, only a handful are typically used and studied. This review aims at collecting a number of results scattered in the literature that can be useful to people who begin the study of Fisher information and to those who are already working on it to have a more organic understanding of the topic. Moreover, we complement the review with new results about the relation between Fisher information and physical evolutions. Extending the study done in [1], we prove that all the physically realisable dynamics can be defined solely in terms of their relation with respect to the Fisher information metric. Moreover, other properties as Markovianity, retrodiction or detailed balance can be expressed in the same formalism. These results show a fact that was partially overseen in the literature, namely the inherently dynamical nature of Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Classical and semi-classical limits in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A semiclassical approximation is derived by using a family of wavepackets to map arbitrary wavefunctions into phase space. If the Hamiltonian can be approximated as linear over each individual wavepacket, as often done when presenting Ehrenfest's theorem, the resulting approximation is a linear first-order partial differential equation on phase space, which will be referred to as the Schr\"odinger-Ehrenfest or SE equation. This advectively transports wavefunctions along classical trajectories, so that as a trajectory is followed in time the amplitude remains constant while the phase changes by the action divided by $\hbar$. The wavefunction's squared-magnitude is a plausible phase space density and obeys Liouville's equation for the classical time evolution. This is a derivation of the Koopman-von~Neumann (KvN) formulation of classical mechanics, which previously was postulated but not derived. With the time-independent SE equation, continuity of the wavefunction requires the change of phase around any closed path in the torus covered by a classical trajectory to be an integer multiple of $2\pi$, giving a standing wave picture of old quantum mechanics. While this applies to any system, for separable systems it gives Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization.</description>

      <title>Knots and Chaos in the R\"ossler System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\"ossler System is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, exhibiting a plethora of complex phenomena - and yet, only a few studies tackled its complexity analytically. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for the existence of chaotic dynamics for the R\"ossler System at some specific parameter values at which the flow satisfies a certain heteroclinic condition. This will allow us to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic trajectories for the flow, and study their bifurcations in the parameter space of the R\"ossler system.</description>

      <title>On the UV/IR mixing of Lie algebra-type noncommutatitive $\phi^4$-theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a UV divergence of the propagator integral implies the divergences of the UV/IR mixing in the two-point function at one-loop for a $\phi^4$-theory on a generic Lie algebra-type noncommutative space-time. The UV/IR mixing is defined as a UV divergence of the planar contribution and an IR singularity of the non-planar contribution, the latter being due to the former UV divergence, and the UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution. Some properties of this general treatment are discussed. The UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution and the renormalizability of the theory are not treated but commented. Applications are performed for the Moyal space, having a UV/IR mixing, and the $\kappa$-Minkowski space for which the two-point function at one-loop is finite.</description>

      <title>New algebraic fast algorithms for $N$-body problems in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents two new algebraic algorithms to perform fast matrix-vector product for $N$-body problems in $d$ dimensions, namely nHODLR$d$D (nested algorithm) and s-nHODLR$d$D (semi-nested or partially nested algorithm). The nHODLR$d$D and s-nHODLR$d$D algorithms are the nested and semi-nested version of our previously proposed fast algorithm, the hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix in $d$ dimensions (HODLR$d$D), respectively, where the admissible clusters are the certain far-field and the vertex-sharing clusters. We rely on algebraic low-rank approximation techniques (ACA and NCA) and develop both algorithms in a black-box (kernel-independent) fashion. The initialization time of the proposed hierarchical structures scales quasi-linearly. Using the nHODLR$d$D and s-nHODLR$d$D hierarchical structures, one can perform the multiplication of a dense matrix (arising out of $N$-body problems) with a vector that scales as $\mathcal{O}(pN)$ and $\mathcal{O}(pN \log(N))$, respectively, where $p$ grows at most poly logarithmically with $N$. The numerical results in $2$D and $3$D $(d=2,3)$ show that the proposed nHODLR$d$D algorithm is competitive to the algebraic Fast Multipole Method in $d$ dimensions with respect to the matrix-vector product time and space complexity. The C++ implementation with OpenMP parallelization of the proposed algorithms is available at \url{https://github.com/riteshkhan/nHODLRdD/}.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of 2+1 geometries: a new approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a convenient method of algebraic classification of 2+1 spacetimes into the types I, II, D, III, N and O, without using any field equations. It is based on the 2+1 analogue of the Newman-Penrose curvature scalars $\Psi_A$ of distinct boost weights, which are specific projections of the Cotton tensor onto a suitable null triad. The algebraic types are then simply determined by the gradual vanishing of such Cotton scalars, starting with those of the highest boost weight. This classification is directly related to the specific multiplicity of the Cotton-aligned null directions (CANDs) and to the corresponding Bel-Debever criteria. Using a bivector (that is 2-form) decomposition, we demonstrate that our method is fully equivalent to the usual Petrov-type classification of 2+1 spacetimes based on the eigenvalue problem and determining the respective canonical Jordan form of the Cotton-York tensor. We also derive a simple synoptic algorithm of algebraic classification based on the key polynomial curvature invariants. To show the practical usefulness of our approach, we perform the classification of several explicit examples, namely the general class of Robinson-Trautman spacetimes with an aligned electromagnetic field and a cosmological constant, and other metrics of various algebraic types.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Incompressible Limit of Current-Vortex Sheets with Surface Tension in Compressible Ideal MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current-vortex sheet is one of the characteristic discontinuities in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The motion of current-vortex sheets is described by a free-interface problem of two-phase MHD flows with magnetic fields tangential to the interface. This model has been widely used in both solar physics and controlled nuclear fusion. This paper is the first part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for compressible current-vortex sheets with or without surface tension. We prove the local well-posedness and the incompressible limit of current-vortex sheets with surface tension. The key observation is a hidden structure of Lorentz force in the vorticity analysis which motivates us to establish the uniform estimates in anisotropic-type Sobolev spaces with weights of Mach number determined by the number of tangential derivatives. Besides, we develop a robust framework for iteration and approximation to prove the local existence of vortex-sheet problems. Our method does not rely on Nash-Moser iteration nor tangential smoothing.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity IV: Linearised Gravity Around Schwarzschild -- An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the fourth in a series dedicated to the mathematically rigorous asymptotic analysis of gravitational radiation under astrophysically realistic setups. It provides an overview of the physical ideas involved in setting up the mathematical problem, the mathematical challenges that need to be overcome once the problem is posed, as well as the main new results we obtain in the companion paper [KM24].
  From the physical perspective, this includes a discussion of how Post-Newtonian theory provides a prediction on the gravitational radiation emitted by $N$ infalling masses from the infinite past in the intermediate zone, i.e. up to some finite advanced time.
  From the mathematical perspective, we then take this prediction, together with the condition that there be no incoming radiation from $\mathcal{I}^-$, as a starting point to set up a scattering problem for the linearised Einstein vacuum equations around Schwarzschild and near spacelike infinity, and we outline how to solve this scattering problem and obtain the asymptotic properties of the scattering solution near $i^0$ and $\mathcal{I}^+$.
  The full mathematical details are presented in the companion paper [KM24].</description>

      <title>Field theory expansions of string theory amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05733v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by quantum field theory (QFT) considerations, we present new representations of the Euler-Beta function and tree-level string theory amplitudes using a new two-channel, local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation. Unlike standard series representations, the new ones are analytic everywhere except at the poles, sum over poles in all channels and include contact interactions, in the spirit of QFT. This enables us to consider mass-level truncation, which preserves all the features of the original amplitudes. By starting with such expansions for generalized Euler-Beta functions and demanding QFT like features, we single out the open superstring amplitude. We demonstrate the difficulty in deforming away from the string amplitude and show that a class of such deformations can be potentially interesting when there is level truncation. Our considerations also lead to new QFT-inspired, parametric representations of the Zeta function and $\pi$, which show fast convergence.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the colored ASEP and stochastic six-vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the colored asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and stochastic six vertex (S6V) model with fully packed initial conditions; the states of these models can be encoded by 2-parameter height functions. We show under Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that these height functions converge to the Airy sheet.
  Several corollaries follow. (1) For ASEP and the S6V model under the basic coupling, we consider the 4-parameter height function at position $y$ and time $t$ with a step initial condition at position $x$ and time $s &lt; t$, and prove that under KPZ scaling it converges to the directed landscape. (2) We prove that ASEPs under the basic coupling, with multiple general initial data, converge to KPZ fixed points coupled through the directed landscape. (3) We prove that the colored ASEP stationary measures converge to the stationary horizon. (4) We prove a strong form of decoupling for the colored ASEP height functions, as well as for the stationary two-point function, as broadly predicted by the theory of non-linear fluctuating hydrodynamics.
  The starting point for our Airy sheet convergence result is an embedding of these colored models into a larger structure -- a color-indexed family of coupled line ensembles with an explicit Gibbs property, i.e., a colored Hall-Littlewood line ensemble. The core of our work then becomes to develop a framework to analyze the edge scaling limit of these ensembles.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with some of the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the Prandtl number and slip-length, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>
