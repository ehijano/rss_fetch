      <title>Forecasting seasonal rainfall in SE Australia using Empirical Orthogonal Functions and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative forecasting of average rainfall into the next season remains highly challenging, but in some favourable isolated cases may be possible with a series of relatively simple steps. We chose to explore predictions of austral springtime rainfall in SE Australia regions based on the surrounding ocean surface temperatures during the winter. In the first stage, we search for correlations between the target rainfall and both the standard ocean climate indicators as well as the time series of surface temperature data expanded in terms of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). In the case of the Indian Ocean, during the winter the dominant EOF shows stronger correlation with the future rainfall than the commonly used Indian Ocean Dipole. Information sources with the strongest correlation to the historical rainfall data are then used as inputs into deep learning artificial neural networks. The resulting hindcasts appear accurate for September and October and less reliable for November. We also attempt to forecast the rainfall in several regions for the coming austral spring.</description>

      <title>MambaDS: Near-Surface Meteorological Field Downscaling with Topography Constrained Selective State Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era of frequent extreme weather and global warming, obtaining precise, fine-grained near-surface weather forecasts is increasingly essential for human activities. Downscaling (DS), a crucial task in meteorological forecasting, enables the reconstruction of high-resolution meteorological states for target regions from global-scale forecast results. Previous downscaling methods, inspired by CNN and Transformer-based super-resolution models, lacked tailored designs for meteorology and encountered structural limitations. Notably, they failed to efficiently integrate topography, a crucial prior in the downscaling process. In this paper, we address these limitations by pioneering the selective state space model into the meteorological field downscaling and propose a novel model called MambaDS. This model enhances the utilization of multivariable correlations and topography information, unique challenges in the downscaling process while retaining the advantages of Mamba in long-range dependency modeling and linear computational complexity. Through extensive experiments in both China mainland and the continental United States (CONUS), we validated that our proposed MambaDS achieves state-of-the-art results in three different types of meteorological field downscaling settings. We will release the code subsequently.</description>

      <title>Satellite monitoring of annual US landfill methane emissions and trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use satellite observations of atmospheric methane from the TROPOMI instrument to estimate total annual methane emissions for 2019-2023 from four large Southeast US landfills with gas collection and control systems. The emissions are on average 6$\times$ higher than the values reported by the landfills to the US Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) which are used by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its national Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI). We find increasing emissions over the 2019-2023 period whereas the GHGRP reports a decrease. The GHGRP requires gas-collecting landfills to estimate their annual emissions either with a recovery-first model (estimating emissions as a function of methane recovered) or a generation-first model (estimating emissions from a first-order-decay applied to waste-in-place). All four landfills choose to use the recovery-first model, which yields emissions that are one-quarter of those from the generation-first model and decreasing over 2019-2023, in contrast with the TROPOMI observations. Our TROPOMI estimates for two of the landfills agree with the generation-first model, with increasing emissions over 2019-2023 due to increasing waste-in-place or decreasing methane recovery, and are still higher than the generation-first model for the other two landfills. Further examination of the GHGRP emissions from all reporting landfills in the US shows that the 19% decrease in landfill emissions reported by the GHGI over 2005-2022 reflects an increasing preference for the recovery-first model by the reporting landfills, rather than an actual emission decrease. The generation-first model would imply an increase in landfill emissions over 2013-2022, and this is more consistent with atmospheric observations.</description>

      <title>Kilometer-Scale Convection Allowing Model Emulation using Generative Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storm-scale convection-allowing models (CAMs) are an important tool for predicting the evolution of thunderstorms and mesoscale convective systems that result in damaging extreme weather. By explicitly resolving convective dynamics within the atmosphere they afford meteorologists the nuance needed to provide outlook on hazard. Deep learning models have thus far not proven skilful at km-scale atmospheric simulation, despite being competitive at coarser resolution with state-of-the-art global, medium-range weather forecasting. We present a generative diffusion model called StormCast, which emulates the high-resolution rapid refresh (HRRR) model-NOAA's state-of-the-art 3km operational CAM. StormCast autoregressively predicts 99 state variables at km scale using a 1-hour time step, with dense vertical resolution in the atmospheric boundary layer, conditioned on 26 synoptic variables. We present evidence of successfully learnt km-scale dynamics including competitive 1-6 hour forecast skill for composite radar reflectivity alongside physically realistic convective cluster evolution, moist updrafts, and cold pool morphology. StormCast predictions maintain realistic power spectra for multiple predicted variables across multi-hour forecasts. Together, these results establish the potential for autoregressive ML to emulate CAMs -- opening up new km-scale frontiers for regional ML weather prediction and future climate hazard dynamical downscaling.</description>

      <title>Impossible temperatures are not as rare as you think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen numerous record-shattering heatwaves in all corners of the globe. In the aftermath of these devastating events, there is interest in identifying worst-case thresholds or upper bounds that quantify just how hot temperatures can become. Generalized Extreme Value theory provides a data-driven estimate of extreme thresholds; however, upper bounds may be exceeded by future events, which undermines attribution and planning for heatwave impacts. Here, we show how the occurrence and relative probability of observed events that exceed a priori upper bound estimates, so-called "impossible" temperatures, has changed over time. We find that many unprecedented events are actually within data-driven upper bounds, but only when using modern spatial statistical methods. Furthermore, there are clear connections between anthropogenic forcing and the "impossibility" of the most extreme temperatures. Robust understanding of heatwave thresholds provides critical information about future record-breaking events and how their extremity relates to historical measurements.</description>

      <title>Inferring Underwater Topography with FINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) find extensive application across various scientific and engineering fields. While numerous models have emerged from both physics and machine learning (ML) communities, there is a growing trend towards integrating these approaches to develop hybrid architectures known as physics-aware machine learning models. Among these, the finite volume neural network (FINN) has emerged as a recent addition. FINN has proven to be particularly efficient in uncovering latent structures in data. In this study, we explore the capabilities of FINN in tackling the shallow-water equations, which simulates wave dynamics in coastal regions. Specifically, we investigate FINN's efficacy to reconstruct underwater topography based on these particular wave equations. Our findings reveal that FINN exhibits a remarkable capacity to infer topography solely from wave dynamics, distinguishing itself from both conventional ML and physics-aware ML models. Our results underscore the potential of FINN in advancing our understanding of spatiotemporal phenomena and enhancing parametrization capabilities in related domains.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., radial gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span $50\%$ to $70\%$ of each planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, quickly leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations of convective staircases in non-rotating and rotating flows, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. Thus, the current existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Transport Modeling of CO$_2$ with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately describing the distribution of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere with atmospheric tracer transport models is essential for greenhouse gas monitoring and verification support systems to aid implementation of international climate agreements. Large deep neural networks are poised to revolutionize weather prediction, which requires 3D modeling of the atmosphere. While similar in this regard, atmospheric transport modeling is subject to new challenges. Both, stable predictions for longer time horizons and mass conservation throughout need to be achieved, while IO plays a larger role compared to computational costs. In this study we explore four different deep neural networks (UNet, GraphCast, Spherical Fourier Neural Operator and SwinTransformer) which have proven as state-of-the-art in weather prediction to assess their usefulness for atmospheric tracer transport modeling. For this, we assemble the CarbonBench dataset, a systematic benchmark tailored for machine learning emulators of Eulerian atmospheric transport. Through architectural adjustments, we decouple the performance of our emulators from the distribution shift caused by a steady rise in atmospheric CO$_2$. More specifically, we center CO$_2$ input fields to zero mean and then use an explicit flux scheme and a mass fixer to assure mass balance. This design enables stable and mass conserving transport for over 6 months with all four neural network architectures. In our study, the SwinTransformer displays particularly strong emulation skill (90-day $R^2 &gt; 0.99$), with physically plausible emulation even for forward runs of multiple years. This work paves the way forward towards high resolution forward and inverse modeling of inert trace gases with neural networks.</description>

      <title>XiHe: A Data-Driven Model for Global Ocean Eddy-Resolving Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading operational Global Ocean Forecasting Systems (GOFSs) use physics-driven numerical forecasting models that solve the partial differential equations with expensive computation. Recently, specifically in atmosphere weather forecasting, data-driven models have demonstrated significant potential for speeding up environmental forecasting by orders of magnitude, but there is still no data-driven GOFS that matches the forecasting accuracy of the numerical GOFSs. In this paper, we propose the first data-driven 1/12{\deg} resolution global ocean eddy-resolving forecasting model named XiHe, which is established from the 25-year France Mercator Ocean International's daily GLORYS12 reanalysis data. XiHe is a hierarchical transformer-based framework coupled with two special designs. One is the land-ocean mask mechanism for focusing exclusively on the global ocean circulation. The other is the ocean-specific block for effectively capturing both local ocean information and global teleconnection. Extensive experiments are conducted under satellite observations, in situ observations, and the IV-TT Class 4 evaluation framework of the world's leading operational GOFSs from January 2019 to December 2020. The results demonstrate that XiHe achieves stronger forecast performance in all testing variables than existing leading operational numerical GOFSs including Mercator Ocean Physical SYstem (PSY4), Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS), BLUElinK OceanMAPS (BLK), and Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM). Particularly, the accuracy of ocean current forecasting of XiHe out to 60 days is even better than that of PSY4 in just 10 days. Additionally, XiHe is able to forecast the large-scale circulation and the mesoscale eddies. Furthermore, it can make a 10-day forecast in only 0.35 seconds, which accelerates the forecast speed by thousands of times compared to the traditional numerical GOFSs.</description>

      <title>Utility of ocean wave parameters in ambient noise prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is concerned with prediction of the "wind noise" component of ambient noise (AN) in the ocean. It builds on the seminal paper by Felizardo and Melville (1995), in which the authors quantified the correlation between AN and individual wind/wave parameters. Acoustic data are obtained from hydrophones at six diverse locations, and wind/wave parameters are obtained from moored buoys and numerical models. We describe a procedure developed for this study which identifies correlation of AN with wave parameters, independent of their mutual correlation with wind speed. We then describe paired calibration/prediction experiments, whereby multiple wind/wave parameters are used simultaneously to estimate AN. We find that the improvement from inclusion of wave parameters is robust but marginal: typically RMSE is reduced by less than 0.3 dB and/or less than 12% of the original RMSE. We interpret the latter outcome as suggesting that wave breaking responds to changes in local winds quickly, relative to, for example, total wave energy, which develops more slowly. This outcome is consistent with prior knowledge of the physics of wave breaking, e.g. Babanin (2011). We discuss this in context of the time/space response of various wave parameters to wind forcing.</description>
