      <title>The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields: new probabilistic spectroscopic classifications and the accretion rates of radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The faint radio-source population includes sources dominated both by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), encoding the evolution of activity in the Universe. To investigate its nature, we probabilistically classified 4,471 radio sources at z &lt; 0.947 using low-frequency radio data from the LoTSS Deep Fields alongside a multi-component model for nebular emission, sampled by spectra obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This was done by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii) the BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte Carlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a star-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a high-\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the probabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the redshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over the latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard' method, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of other methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable overall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric classifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify 2-5 times more RQ AGN. Furthermore, our high-confidence spectroscopic classifications show that radiatively-efficient and inefficient AGN exhibit clearly distinct Eddington-scaled accretion rate distributions, contrary to recent findings in the literature. Overall, our results highlight the need for new and forthcoming spectroscopic campaigns targeting radio sources, on the pathway to the SKA.</description>

      <title>The Missing Hard Photons of Little Red Dots: Their Incident Ionizing Spectra Resemble Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) has largely been investigated through their continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region. In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension between the ionizing properties implied from H$\alpha$ and HeII$\,\lambda$4686. The high H$\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra. The low HeII/H$\beta$ ($\sim10^{-2}$, $&lt;20\times$ local AGN median) further points to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense gas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen recombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII remains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with Cloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations include: exotic AGN with red rest-optical emission; a very high {\it average} optical depth ($&gt;10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing hydrogen cloud, the HeII-based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Radial Migration on Disk Galaxy SFHs: I. Biases in Spatially Resolved Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates. In the inner disk (R &lt; h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk, migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward, whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Analysis of Gas-phase Metallicity Evolution with 1-3 Gyr Time Sampling over the Past 12 Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) using uniform metallicity diagnostics across redshifts $z\sim0$ to $z\sim3.3$. We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726,3729$ emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with existing measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using ratios of the [OII], H$\beta$, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at $z&lt;1$ and $z&gt;1$. We find that the low-mass power law slope of the MZR remains constant over this redshift range with a value of $\gamma=0.28\pm0.01$, implying the outflow metal loading factor ($\zeta_\text{out}=\frac{Z_{\text{out}}}{Z_{\text{ISM}}}\frac{\dot{M}_{\text{out}}}{\text{SFR}}$) scales approximately as $\rm \zeta_{out}\propto M_*^{-0.3}$ out to at least $z\sim3.3$. The normalization of the MZR at $10^{10}\ \text{M}_\odot$ decreases with increasing redshift at a rate of $d\log(\text{O/H})/dz =-0.11\pm0.01$ across the full redshift range. We find that any evolution of the FMR is smaller than 0.1 dex out to $z\sim3.3$. We compare to cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and find that IllustrisTNG matches our measured combination of a nearly-invariant MZR slope, rate of MZR normalization decrease, and constant or very weakly evolving FMR. This work provides the most detailed view of MZR and FMR evolution from the present day through Cosmic Noon with a fine time sampling of $1-3$ Gyr, setting a robust baseline for metallicity evolution studies at $z&gt;4$ with JWST.</description>

      <title>How Dust Models Shape High-z Galaxy Morphology: Insights from the NewCluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust plays a pivotal role in shaping the observed morphology of galaxies. While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas (DTG) or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code SKIRT, and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology indices and use the $G-M_{20}$ test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy (LTG) fraction, particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM models fail to capture key morphological features.</description>

      <title>Ionizing Radiation Escape from Low-Redshift Galaxies and Its Connection to Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation from early galaxies transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is intimately connected to the fueling and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. IGM attenuation interferes with high-redshift LyC observations, but growing samples of LyC observations at z&lt;0.1 are revealing the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies. Along with multi-wavelength observations of nearby LyC-emitting candidates, cosmological simulations, and simulations of LyC escape from star-forming clouds, recent studies are providing insights into the physics of LyC escape and the possible characteristics of the galaxies that reionized the universe. Here, I review progress in LyC detections, the inferred indirect signatures of LyC escape and their application to high redshift, and our current understanding of the physical conditions that lead to high LyC escape. These findings include: LyC-emitting populations are diverse, and multiple factors correlate with LyC escape, particularly neutral gas absorption, dust attenuation, nebular ionization, and concentrated star formation. Radiative feedback plays a critical role in the youngest starbursts with the highest LyC escape fractions, but mechanical feedback may also contribute. Further research is needed to clarify the timing and role of different feedback mechanisms and to connect local LyC-production sites with the broader interstellar medium. Indirect LyC diagnostics show promise, but we need to understand whether and how the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies evolve from low to high redshift.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation at 50 pc scales using the PHANGS-MUSE galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncircular motions have been observed across various spatial scales in disk galaxies, yet the physical properties of the gas involved in these motions remain poorly constrained. Using data from 19 galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE sample, we investigated the prevalence of noncircular flows at spatial resolutions of tens of parsecs. We developed a new tool for 3D kinematic modelling of data cubes and applied it to the PHANGS-MUSE H$\alpha$ spectral lines to recover the underlying circular, noncircular motions, as well as the intrinsic velocity dispersion in these objects. The PHANGS-MUSE galaxies exhibit rotation supported disks with $V_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_\mathrm{intrin}$ ratios $\gtrsim$ 5. Our analysis revealed ionized gas exhibiting noncircular motions at different amplitudes, with low velocity amplitudes of about $5\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ associated with the axisymmetric rotation component, deviations of $\sim10\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ primarily linked to interarm and spiral arms, and larger deviations ($&gt;20 \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$), found in the central and bar regions. We found that the velocity dispersion and the strength of ionization correlate with the amplitude of noncircular motions, suggesting that the underlying dynamics of the warm gas are closely tied to its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of gravity on changing magnetic field orientations in a sample of massive protostellar clusters observed with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field is integral to our understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds and star formation within. We present a polarimetric survey of 17 massive protostellar cluster forming clumps, covered in 34 pointings in the 230-GHz window using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two array configurations, C43-1 and C43-4, probe linearly polarized dust emission, hence the plane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields, at resolutions of 1\arcsec\ and 0\arcsec.4 that correspond to approximately 0.01pc core and $10^3$ au envelope scales, respectively. The relative orientations (ROs) of the magnetic field probed at two spatial scales are analyzed for the entire protostellar cluster sample and for a subset of objects in NGC 6334. We found a bimodal distribution of ROs with peaks at 0\deg\ (parallel) and 90\deg (orthogonal) for the entire sample combined as well as for NGC 6334. We investigate the physical origin of this bimodal distribution through a projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS) analysis in relation to column densities and local gravity in NGC 6334. We found an excess of parallel magnetic fields at column densities $&gt; 10^{23}$ \cmm. The underlying cause of the RO distribution of the magnetic field is gravitational collapse at higher gas densities, which drags and reorients the magnetic field as shown in the alignment between the magnetic field and the direction of gravitational forces. The distribution of ROs observed here is consistent with the evolution of relative orientations of an initially sub-Alv\'enic cloud that becomes magnetically super-critical and super-Alv\'enic as the cloud collapses to form stars.</description>

      <title>The life and times of dark matter haloes: what will I be when I grow up?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2 simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic time, we find that only 40\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z = 1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within the $(1 h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of objects can enter and leave the sample over time. These findings have important implications for observational cluster selection and comparisons between simulations and surveys, especially at high redshift.</description>

      <title>An ALMA Band 7 survey of SDSS/Herschel quasars in Stripe 82: I. The properties of the 870 micron counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Quasar studies with Herschel/SPIRE often report host luminosities ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs) of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam. High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of 152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally, we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray ionisation rate in low-mass cores: the role of the environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Cosmic rays drive several key processes for the chemistry and dynamical evolution of star-forming regions. Their effect is quantified mainly by means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\zeta_2$.
  Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass starless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average level of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the environment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus cloud and the other isolated cores we targeted.
  Methods: We compute $\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column density} of ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of HCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity molecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel.
  Results: We report $\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide upper limits on the three remaining sources. The values span almost two orders of magnitude, from $1.3 \times 10^{-18}\, \rm s^{-1}$ to $8.5 \times 10^{-17}\, \rm s^{-1}$.
  Conclusions: We find no significant correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the core's column densities $N\rm (H_2)$. On the contrary, we find a positive correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the cores' temperature, estimated via Herschel data: cores embedded in warmer environments present higher ionisation levels. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the other clouds we targeted. The higher ionisation rates in these regions support the scenario that low-mass protostars in the vicinity of our targeted cores contribute to the re-acceleration of local cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass Assembly History of Massive Quiescent Galaxies since $z\sim4$: Insights from Spatially Resolved SED Fitting with JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift show significantly more compact morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive $(\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11)$ quiescent galaxies at $0&lt;z&lt;4$ with public James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey. We find that at $z \sim 3.5$, the half-mass radius is about 5.4 times smaller than at $z \sim 0.5$. This growth is driven by stellar mass buildup in the outskirts ($r &gt; 4$ kpc), while the central regions ($r \sim 1$ kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as $\log(R_{e,mass}) \propto \alpha \log(M_*)$, and find $\alpha = 2.67^{+1.14}_{-1.17}$ for $z\lessapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by minor mergers, and $\alpha = 0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for $z\gtrapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow through combinations of minor and major mergers.</description>

      <title>Large-scale surveys of the quasar proximity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03848v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UV radiation from high redshift quasars causes a local deficit in the neutral hydrogen absorption (Lyman-alpha forest) in their spectra, known as the proximity effect. Measurements from small samples of tens to hundreds of quasars have been used to constrain the global intensity of the UV background radiation, but so far the power of large-scale surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has not been used to investigate the UV background in more detail. We develop a CDM-based halo model of the quasar proximity effect, which accounts by construction for the fact that quasars reside in overdense regions. We test this model on quasar Lyman-alpha spectra from the ASTRID cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, which includes self-consistent formation of quasar black holes and the intergalactic medium surrounding them. Fitting the model to individual quasar spectra, we constrain two parameters, r_eq (the radius at which the local quasar radiation intensity equals the background), and the quasar bias b_q (related to host halo mass). We find that r_eq can be recovered in an unbiased fashion with a statistical uncertainty of 25-50% from a single quasar spectrum. Applying such fitting to samples of millions of spectra from e.g., DESI would allow measurement of the UVBG intensity and its evolution with redshift with high precision. We use another, larger-scale, lower resolution simulation (Uchuu) to test how such a large sample of proximity effect measurements could be used to probe the spatial fluctuations in the intergalactic radiation field. We find that the large-scale structure of the UV radiation intensity could be mapped and its power spectrum measured on 100-1000 Mpc/h scales. This could allow the large-scale radiation field to join the density field as a dataset for constraining cosmology and the sources of radiation.</description>

      <title>KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb: Mass Measurements for Two Super-Earth Microlensing Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb were the lowest mass-ratio microlensing planets at the time of discovery. For both events, microlensing parallax measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope implied lens systems that were more distant and massive than those inferred from the ground-based parallax. Here, we report on the detection of excess flux aligned to the event locations using Keck Adaptive Optics imaging, which is consistent with the expected brightness of main-sequence hosts under the ground-based parallax, but inconsistent with that predicted by Spitzer. Based on the excess flux, ground-based parallax, and angular Einstein radius, we determine KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb to be a $4.2\pm0.5 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.70\pm0.07 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $3.1\pm0.3$ au, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb to be a $2.0\pm0.2 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.40\pm0.03 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $1.7\pm0.1$ au. We report on additional light-curve models for KMT-2018-BLG-0029 under the generalized inner-outer (offset) degeneracy, which were not reported in the original analysis. We point out inconsistencies in the inner/outer labeling of the degenerate models in the lens and source planes, and advocate for the lens-plane convention, which refers to the planet being closer or further to the host star compared to the image it perturbs. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of breaking this degeneracy via ground concurrent observations with the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Unified Gas Heating Constraints on Extended Dark Matter Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark matter compact objects (EDCOs) from interstellar gas heating. These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new transitional type of evolved massive stars with hard ionizing flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descendants of the most massive stars and show emission-line dominated spectra formed in their powerful stellar winds. Marking the final evolution stage before core collapse, the standard picture of WR stars has been that they evolve through three well-defined spectral subtypes known as WN, WC, and WO. Here, we present a detailed analysis of five objects that defy this scheme, demonstrating that WR stars can also evolve directly from the WN to the WO stage. Our study reveals that this direct transition is connected to low metallicity and weaker winds. The WN/WO stars and their immediate WN precursors are hot and emit a high flux of photons capable of fully ionizing helium. The existence of these stages unveil that high mass stars which manage to shed off their outer hydrogen layers in a low-metallicity environment can spend a considerable fraction of their lifetime in a stage that is difficult to detect in integrated stellar populations, but at the same time yields hard ionizing flux. The identification of the WN to WO evolution path for massive stars has significant implications for understanding the chemical enrichment and ionizing feedback in star-forming galaxies, in particular at earlier cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution imprints in the rare isotopes of nearby M dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, collectively termed metals, were created inside stars and dispersed through space at the final stages of stellar evolution. The relative amounts of different isotopes (variants of the same element with different masses) in stellar atmospheres provide clues about how our galaxy evolved chemically over billions of years. M dwarfs are small, cool, long-lived stars that comprise three-quarters of all stars in our galaxy. Their spectra exhibit rich fingerprints of their composition, making them potential tracers of chemical evolution. We measure rare carbon and oxygen isotopes in 32 nearby M dwarfs spanning a range of metallicities using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We find that stars with higher metal content have lower 12C/13C ratios, indicating they formed from material progressively enriched in 13C over time. This pattern is consistent with models where novae eruptions contributed significant amounts of 13C to the interstellar medium over the past few billion years. Our measurements of 16O/18O ratio match theoretical predictions and suggest that metal-rich stars reach 16O/18O ratios significantly lower than the Sun. These results establish M dwarfs as tracers of chemical enrichment throughout cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Connecting The Hierarchically Merging Binary Black Hole Population To Their Host Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes with masses $\sim\,80-150\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ suggests that some proportion of black hole binary systems form hierarchically in dense astrophysical environments, as most stellar evolution models cannot explain the origin of these massive black holes through isolated binary evolution. A significant fraction of such mergers could occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN. We find that if the observed merging population is dominated by binaries formed dynamically in AGN, then this could be determined with $\mathcal{O}(5000)$ mergers detected at the sensitivity that is projected for the upcoming A\# gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Prospects for dark matter observations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>

Abstract: The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.</description>

      <title>Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity Mapping at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.</description>

      <title>A new multifluid method for dusty astrophysical flows. Application to turbulent protostellar collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form in collapsing clouds of gas and dust. The presence of dust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the protostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular clouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and evolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the whole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented a neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in the RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag source term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a Riemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical dust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the capacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse down to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large dust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The spatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust enrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the envelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial turbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal velocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it to regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the coupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the dynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the envelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain sizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto supermassive and intermediate mass black holes in cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion is the dominant contribution to the cosmic massive black hole density in the Universe today. Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is challenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to black hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for gas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in large-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the "Learning the Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial conditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we update the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based inflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple model for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive black hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters. Once the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly similar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the details in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole regime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion mechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high redshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high redshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies and mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same black hole formation model.</description>

      <title>The Potential of the SPHEREx Mission for Characterizing PAH 3.3 {\mu}m Emission in Nearby Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Together with gas, stars, and supermassive black holes, dust is crucial in stellar and galaxy evolution. Hence, understanding galaxies' dust properties across cosmic time is critical to studying their evolution. In addition to photometric constraints on the absorption of blue light and its re-emission at infrared (IR) wavelengths, dust grain properties can be explored spectroscopically via Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands in the mid-IR. The new SPHEREx space telescope conducts an all-sky spectrophotometric survey of stars and galaxies at wavelengths of 0.75-5$\,\mu$m, making it ideal for studying the widespread presence of the 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH emission across galaxy populations out to z ~ 0.4. In this paper, we simulated galaxy spectra to investigate SPHEREx's capability to study PAH emission in such galaxies. We find that for the all-sky survey, the PAH 3.3$\,\mu$m emission band flux can be measured to 30% accuracy at $\log(\rm M/{\rm M_\odot})&gt;9.5$ and Star Formation Rate (SFR) $&gt; 1\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.1$, $\log(\rm M/{\rm M_\odot}) &gt; 10.5$ and ${\rm SFR} &gt; 10\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.2-0.3$, and $\log(\rm M/{\rm M_\odot})&gt;11$ and ${\rm SFR} &gt; 100\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.4$. For deep SPHEREx fields, a factor of ~10 deeper sensitivity limits can be reached. Overall, SPHEREx will enable the measurement of the 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH band emission in a several 100,000 galaxies across the sky, providing a population study of the smallest dust grains ("nano grains") and radiation properties in massive galaxies in the nearby Universe.</description>

      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics VII: High redshift Supermassive Black Hole growth under an alternative Hubble Parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at very high redshift hosted by massive galaxy provide a challenge to the SMBH and massive galaxy formation models which are predicated on the Lambda CDM model that from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data predicts a Hubble constant currently in tension with late time observations. In a gravitational system with two asymptotic solutions such as a central mass in an expanding cosmological background or an expanding background with radiation and baryons, we find that a particle's free falling speed resulting from adding the free falling speeds due to the asymptotic solutions is also a theoretically viable solution [1]-[2]. We use this new model to examine the SMBH formation time-line and find that the time lapse between redshifts increases and provides sufficient cosmological time for the formation of SMBHs at high redshifts. We also find that the Hubble parameter in this model is consistent with Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and DESI DR2 data upto z~2.33, while matching the observed CMB acoustic angular scale constraint.</description>

      <title>Uncover 3D Dark Matter Distribution of the Milky Way by an Empirical Triaxial Orbit-Superposition Model: Method Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dynamical model, named empirical triaxial orbit-superposition model, for the Milky Way halo. This model relies on minimal physical assumptions that the system is stationary, meaning the distribution function in 6D phase-space does not change when the stars orbiting in the correct gravitational potential. We validate our method by applying it to mock datasets that mimic the observations of the Milky Way halo from LAMOST + Gaia with stars' 3D position and 3D velocity observed. By removing the stellar disk and substructures, correcting the selection function, we obtain a sample of smooth halo stars considered as stationary and complete. We construct a gravitational potential including a highly flexible triaxial dark matter halo with adaptable parameters. Within each specified gravitational potential, we integrate orbits of these halo stars, and build a model by superposing the orbits together taking the weights of stars derived from the selection function correction. The goodness of the models are evaluated by comparing the density distributions as well as 3D velocity distributions numerically represented in the model to that in the data. The shape and radial density distribution of the underlying dark matter halo can be constrained well simultaneously. We apply it to three mock galaxies with different intrinsic shapes of their dark matter halos and achieved accurate recovery of the 3D dark matter density distributions for all.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we have taken into account.</description>

      <title>Testing and Combining Transient Spectral Classification Tools on 4MOST-like Blended Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) expected to provide an influx of transient spectra when it begins observations in early 2026 we consider the potential for real-time classification of these spectra. We investigate three extant spectroscopic transient classifiers: the Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier (DASH), Next Generation SuperFit (NGSF) and SuperNova IDentification (SNID), with a focus on comparing the completeness and purity of the transient samples they produce. We manually simulate fibre losses critical for accurately determining host-contamination and use the 4MOST Exposure Time Calculator to produce realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy contaminated spectra. We investigate the three classifiers individually and in all possible combinations. We find that a combination of DASH and NGSF can produce a SN Ia sample with a purity of 99.9% while successfully classifying 70% of SNe Ia. However, it struggles to classify non-SN Ia transients. We investigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and the transient's fraction of total fibre flux, finding that both can be used to improve non-SN Ia transient classification completeness by 8--44% with SNe Ibc benefitting the most and superluminous (SL) SNe the least. Finally, we present an example classification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and completeness across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, SL and non-SN transients. We find that it is possible to classify 75% of input spectra with &gt;70% purity in all classes except non-SN transients. Precise values can be varied using different classifiers and photometric cuts to suit the needs of a given study.</description>

      <title>Precovery Observations of 3I/ATLAS from TESS Suggests Possible Distant Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third macroscopic interstellar object detected traversing the Solar System. Since its initial discovery on UT 01 July 2025, hundreds of hours on a range of observational facilities have been dedicated to measure the physical properties of this object. These observations have provided astrometry to refine the orbital solution, photometry to measure the color, a rotation period and secular light curve, and spectroscopy to characterize the composition of the coma. Here, we report precovery photometry of 3I/ATLAS as observed with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly continuously by TESS from UT 07 May 2025 to 02 June 2025. We use the shift-stack method to create deep stack images to recover the object. These composite images reveal that 3I/ATLAS has an average TESS magnitude of $T_\textrm{mag} = 20.83 \pm 0.05, 19.28 \pm 0.05$ and an absolute visual magnitude of $H_V = 13.72 \pm 0.35; 12.52 \pm 0.35$, the latter being consistent with magnitudes reported in July 2025. When coupled with recent HST images deriving a nucleus size of R$&lt;$2.8 km (H$&gt;$15.4), our measurements suggest that 3I/ATLAS may have been active out at $\sim 6$ au. Additionally, we extract a $\sim 20$ day light curve and find no statistically significant evidence of a nucleus rotation period. Nevertheless, the data presented here are some of the earliest precovery images of 3I/ATLAS and may be used in conjunction with future observations to constrain the properties of our third interstellar interloper.</description>
