      <title>A Time-Domain Method of Auxiliary Sources for Efficient Analysis of Transient Electromagnetic Scattering by Moderately Conductive Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a time-domain implementation of the Method of Auxiliary Sources (MAS) combined with the Standard Impedance Boundary Condition (SIBC) for electromagnetic scattering problems involving cylindrical scatterers with finite but moderate conductivity. The proposed approach focuses on solving the two-dimensional problem using a first-order SIBC, which is valid when the conductivity is sufficiently higher than the maximum spectral frequency times the dielectric permittivity of the scatterer. This regime includes moderately conductive materials--such as carbon-based composites, conductive polymers, and doped dielectrics--that are increasingly used in real-world radio-frequency applications, including wearable electronics, electromagnetic interference shielding, and biomedical sensors. Under the above validity conditions, the interaction between the incident wave and the scatterer is dominated by surface effects, allowing for an efficient and accurate modeling strategy without the need to compute internal fields. The theoretical formulation of the time-domain MAS-SIBC method is developed, followed by extensive numerical testing on various geometries whose cross section is a closed curve. Such geometries include circular, elliptical, super-circular, rounded-triangular, and inverted-elliptical scatterers. A planar geometry is also tested. All results are validated against analytical solutions and commercial frequency-domain solvers, demonstrating the accuracy and practical potential of the proposed method. The findings suggest that time-domain MAS-SIBC offers a promising and computationally efficient approach for modeling scattering from materials even with moderate conductivity.</description>

      <title>Dirac-von Neumann Type Axiomatic Structure for Classical Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in \textit{classical} electromagnetism that parallels the Hilbert Space of quantum mechanics. The axioms of this classical theory are the so-called Dirac-von Neumann axioms, however, with classical potentials in place of the wavefunction and the indeterministic collapse postulate removed. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is a unique classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. The noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory simply reflects its wavenature. A classical analogue of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is developed for electromagnetic waves, and its implications discussed. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) classical mechanics (for point particles), and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate an elegant, completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical Lie commutators for electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Tight composites knots and chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality is known to play a central role in the properties of many physical systems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Chemical and optical properties of materials are only two of the many examples where transformation properties under reflection symmetry become relevant in describing a real-world system: within this context, the word enantiomers is used to describe two different types of geometric shapes related by a reflection, called left-handed or right-handed enantiomers, in reference to the definition of chirality and handedness of screws presented by Maxwell in its treatise. In this short communication, the relation between chirality and the geometric shape of tight composite knots is discussed using arguments from the linear elastic theory of ropes. The results presented here serve as the starting point for a more general analysis, which we intend to pursue in future investigations.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of degrees of freedom (NDoF) in a communication channel fundamentally limits the number of independent spatial modes available for transmitting and receiving information. Although the NDoF can be computed numerically for specific configurations using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel operator, this approach provides limited physical insight. In this paper, we introduce a simple analytical estimate for the NDoF between arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions in free space. In the electrically large limit, where the NDoF is high, it is well approximated by the mutual shadow area, measured in units of wavelength squared. This area corresponds to the projected overlap of the regions, integrated over all lines of sight, and captures their effective spatial coupling. The proposed estimate generalizes and unifies several previously established results, including those based on Weyl's law, shadow area, and the paraxial approximation. We analyze several example configurations to illustrate the accuracy of the estimate and validate it through comparisons with numerical SVD computations of the propagation channel. The results provide both practical tools and physical insight for the design and analysis of high-capacity communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>The Reciprocal Velocity Force of a Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the course of their studies, students of physics accumulate experience in solving problems for a variety of forces, not only developing a strong physical intuition for each force but also having an understanding of how each force is realized in the physical world. With this in mind we believe not enough emphasis is placed on the reciprocal velocity force $F(v)=\frac{C}{v}$. The theoretical importance of this force is illustrated by the units of the constant $C$ which are those of power. Such a force has constant power, as $P(t)=F(v(t))v(t)=C$. The goal of this paper is to use graphical methods to explain how such a peculiar force arises from a device called a transmission, to explore some of the consequences of this force, and to briefly discuss its role in automotive physics.</description>
