      <title>Bifurcation and Local Rigidity of Homogeneous Solutions to the Yamabe Problem on Aloff-Wallach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct 1-parameter families of well-known solutions to the Yamabe problem defined on Aloff-Wallach Spaces to determine bifurcation instants for these homogeneous spaces by examining changes in the Morse index of these metrics as the parameter varies over the positive real numbers. A bifurcation point for such families is an accumulation point of other solutions to the Yamabe problem, while a local rigidity point is an isolated solution of this problem, i.e., it is not a bifurcation point.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the first eigenvalue of a minimal hypersurface in the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a closed embedded minimal hypersurface in the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{m+1}$ and let $\Lambda=\max\limits_{\Sigma}|A|$ be the norm of its second fundamental form. In this work we prove that the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $\Sigma$ satisfies
  $$\lambda_1(\Sigma)&gt; \dfrac{m}{2}+\frac{m(m+1)}{32(12\Lambda+m+11)^2+8},$$ and $\lambda_1(\Sigma)=m$, when $\Lambda\le\sqrt{m}$.
  In particular, this estimate improves the one obtained recently in \cite{duncan2023improved}. The proof of our main result is based on a Rayleigh quotient estimate for a harmonic extension of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian of $\Sigma$ in the spirit of \cite{choi1983first}.</description>

      <title>Totally geodesic submanifolds in the manifold SPD of symmetric positive-definite real matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a self-contained exposition of the geometry of symmetric positive-definite real $n\times n$ matrices $\operatorname{SPD}(n)$, including necessary and sufficent conditions for a submanifold $\mathcal{N} \subset\operatorname{SPD}(n)$ to be totally geodesic for the affine-invariant Riemannian metric. A non-linear projection $x\mapsto \pi(x)$ on a totally geodesic submanifold is defined. This projection has the minimizing property with respect to the Riemannian metric: it maps an arbitrary point $x \in\operatorname{SPD}(n)$ to the unique closest element $\pi(x)$ in the totally geodesic submanifold for the distance defined by the affine-invariant Riemannian metric. Decompositions of the space $\operatorname{SPD}(n)$ follow, as well as variants of the polar decomposition of non-singular matrices known as Mostow's decompositions. Applications to decompositions of covariant matrices are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Regularity of minimal surfaces with capillary boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $\varepsilon$-regularity theorems for varifolds with capillary boundary condition in a Riemannian manifold. These varifolds were first introduced by Kagaya-Tonegawa \cite{KaTo}. We establish a uniform first variation control for all such varifolds (and free-boundary varifolds generally) satisfying a sharp density bound and prove that if a capillary varifold has bounded mean curvature and is close to a capillary half-plane with angle not equal to $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$, then it coincides with a $C^{1,\alpha}$ properly embedded hypersurface. We apply our theorem to deduce regularity at a generic point along the boundary in the region where the density is strictly less than $1$.</description>

      <title>On cohomological invariants of complex and almost complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact complex manifold, we develop Hodge theory for the elliptic complex of differential forms defined by Bigolin in 1969 and recently referred as the Schweitzer complex. We exhibits several $L^2$ orthogonal decompositions of spaces of forms and prove a Hodge decomposition for harmonic forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Then we compute the cohomology of this complex on the small deformations of the complex structure of the Iwasawa manifold, showing that this cohomology is as powerful as Aeppli and Bott-Chern cohomology, in order to distinguish classes of complex structures. Finally, we partially extend the definition of this complex on almost complex manifolds, providing a new cohomological invariant on 1-forms which is finite dimensional when the manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>Cartan Geometry and Infinite-Dimensional Kempf-Ness Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pioneer the development of a rigorous infinite-dimensional framework for the Kempf-Ness theorem, addressing the significant challenge posed by the absence of a complexification for the symmetry group in infinite dimensions, e.g, the diffeomorphism group. We propose a novel approach, based on Cartan bundles, to generalize Kempf-Ness theory to infinite dimensions, invoking the fundamental role played by the Maurer-Cartan form. This approach allows us to define and study objects essential for the Kempf-Ness theorem, such as the complex model for orbits and the Kempf-Ness function, as well as establishing its convexity properties and defining a generalized Futaki character. We show how our framework can be applied to the study of various problems in K\"ahler geometry, deformation quantization, and gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Programming evolution of geometry in shape-morphing sheets via spatiotemporal activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape-programmed sheets morph from one surface into another upon activation by stimuli such as illumination, and have attracted much interest for their potential engineering applications, especially in soft robotics. Complex shape changes can be achieved by patterning a simple local active deformation (e.g. isotropic swelling), to generate differential growth. Usually the material itself is designed $\unicode{x2014}$ for example by patterning a molecular director $\unicode{x2014}$ such that a particular shape change occurs upon exposure to a spatially uniform stimulus. A limitation of this paradigm is that typically only one target geometry can be attained as the stimulus is adjusted. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by patterning the stimulus itself, thereby exercising spatiotemporal control over local deformation magnitudes. Thus a single physical sample can be induced to traverse a continuous family of target geometries, opening the door to precise shape adjustments, new functionalities, and designable non-reciprocal loops in shape space. We illustrate these possibilities with examples including active parabolic reflectors, chiral flow guides, and bending channels. Finding the necessary patterns of activation involves solving families of metric inverse problems; we solve these by reduction to ODEs in an axisymmetric setting, then present a novel numerical scheme to solve them in generality.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Floer theory on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11231v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop connections between the qualitative dynamics of Hamiltonian isotopies on a surface $\Sigma$ and their chain-level Floer theory using ideas drawn from Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's theory of finite energy foliations. We associate to every collection of capped $1$-periodic orbits which is `maximally unlinked relative the Morse range' a singular foliation on $S^1 \times \Sigma$ which is positively transverse to the vector field $\partial_t \oplus X^H$ and which is assembled in a straight-forward way from the relevant Floer moduli spaces. This provides a Floer-theoretic method for producing foliations of the type which appear in Le Calvez's theory of positively transverse foliations for surface homeomorphisms. Additionally, we provide a purely topological characterization of those Floer chains which both represent the fundamental class in $CF_*(H,J)$, and which lie in the image of some chain-level PSS map. This leads to the definition of a novel family of spectral invariants which share many of the same formal properties as the Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants, and we compute the novel spectral invariant associated to the fundamental class in entirely dynamical terms. This significantly extends a project initiated by Humili\`{e}re-Le Roux-Seyfaddini in arXiv:1502.03834.</description>

      <title>The Hessian geometry of the ideal gas in rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hessian geometry associated with an ideal gas in a spherical centrifuge. According to Souriau, a spherically confined ideal gas admit states of thermal and rotational equilibrium. These states, called Gibbs states, form an exponential family with an action of the Euclidean rotation group. We investigate its Hessian (Fisher-Rao) geometry and show that in the high angular velocity limit, the geometry can be compared to the Hessian geometry of a spherical rigid body which we show to be isometric to a hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Kiselman Minimum Principle and Rooftop Envelopes in Complex Hessian Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a semipositive $(1,1)$-form in Euclidean domains, providing a significant element in understanding geodesics within the context of complex Hessian equations. Based on the foundational Perron envelope construction, we prove a decomposition of $m$-subharmonic solutions, and a general comparison principle that effectively manages singular Hessian measures. Additionally, we establish a rooftop equality and an analogue of the Kiselman minimum principle, which are crucial ingredients in establishing a criterion for geodesic connectivity among $m$-subharmonic functions, expressed in terms of their asymptotic envelopes.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of GKM graphs and regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the full flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ associated with a regular semisimple matrix $S$ of order $n$ and a function $h$ from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to itself satisfying a certain condition. We show that when $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is connected and not the entire space $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the reductive part of the identity component $\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is an algebraic torus of dimension $n-1$ and $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))/\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ or $\mathfrak{S}_n\rtimes \{\pm 1\}$, where $\mathfrak{S}_n$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$. As a byproduct of our argument, we show that $\mathrm{Aut}(X)/\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is a finite group for any projective GKM manifold $X$.</description>
