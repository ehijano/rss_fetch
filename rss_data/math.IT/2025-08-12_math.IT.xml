      <title>AMP-based Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation for Massive Grant-Free Access in OFDM-based Wideband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based grant-free access for wideband systems under frequency-selective fading, existing device activity detection and channel estimation methods need substantial accuracy improvement or computation time reduction. In this paper, we aim to resolve this issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based grant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device activity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation problems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph that captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device activities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based algorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device activity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both proposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the pilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we analyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC has the lower computational complexity (in dominant term). Finally, numerical results show the two proposed AMP-based algorithms' superior performance and respective preferable regions, revealing their significant values for OFDM-based grant-free access.</description>

      <title>Communication-Learning Co-Design for Differentially Private Over-the-Air Federated Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL). In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs) periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly, over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>When isometry and equivalence for skew constacyclic codes coincide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the notions of $(n,\sigma)$-isometry and $(n,\sigma)$-equivalence introduced by Ou-azzou et al coincide for most skew $(\sigma,a)$-constacyclic codes of length $n$. To prove this, we show that all Hamming-weight-preserving homomorphisms between their ambient algebras must have degree one when those algebras are nonassociative. We work in the general setting of commutative base rings $S$. As a consequence, we propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry of skew constacyclic codes that exactly capture all Hamming-preserving isomorphisms, and lead to tighter classifications. In the process we determine homomorphisms between nonassociative Petit algebras, prioritizing the algebras $S[t;\sigma]/S[t;\sigma](t^n-a)$, which give rise to skew constacyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Samorodnitsky noisy function inequalities, with applications to error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inequality by Samorodnitsky states that if $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a nonnegative boolean function, and $S \subseteq [n]$ is chosen by randomly including each coordinate with probability a certain $\lambda = \lambda(q,\rho) &lt; 1$, then \begin{equation}
  \log \|T_\rho f\|_q \leq \mathbb{E}_{S} \log \|\mathbb{E}(f|S)\|_q\;. \end{equation} Samorodnitsky's inequality has several applications to the theory of error-correcting codes. Perhaps most notably, it can be used to show that \emph{any} binary linear code (with minimum distance $\omega(\log n)$) that has vanishing decoding error probability on the BEC$(\lambda)$ (binary erasure channel) also has vanishing decoding error on \emph{all} memoryless symmetric channels with capacity above some $C = C(\lambda)$.
  Samorodnitsky determined the optimal $\lambda = \lambda(q,\rho)$ for his inequality in the case that $q \geq 2$ is an integer. In this work, we generalize the inequality to $f : \Omega^n \to \mathbb{R}$ under any product probability distribution $\mu^{\otimes n}$ on $\Omega^n$; moreover, we determine the optimal value of $\lambda = \lambda(q,\mu,\rho)$ for any real $q \in [2,\infty]$, $\rho \in [0,1]$, and distribution~$\mu$. As one consequence, we obtain the aforementioned coding theory result for linear codes over \emph{any} finite alphabet.</description>

      <title>Neural Beam Field for Spatial Beam RSRP Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile (MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam configurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled ``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP data. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization, while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-generation dense wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Neural Channel Knowledge Map Assisted Scheduling Optimization of Active IRSs in Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) have potential for significant performance gains in next-generation wireless networks but face key challenges, notably severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling due to hardware constraints. Active IRSs partially address pathloss but still require efficient scheduling in cell-level multi-IRS multi-user systems, whereby the overhead/delay of channel state acquisition and the scheduling complexity both rise dramatically as the user density and channel dimensions increase. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel scheduling framework based on neural Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), designing Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) from historical channel/throughput measurements tagged with user positions. Specifically, two cascaded networks, LPS-Net and SE-Net, are designed to predict link power statistics (LPS) and ergodic SE accurately. We further propose a low-complexity Stable Matching-Iterative Balancing (SM-IB) scheduling algorithm. Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM significantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while the SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with greatly reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes: Design and Efficient Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes, where single parity-check constraints on the code bits are replaced with generalized constraints (an arbitrary linear code), are a promising class of codes for low-latency communication. The block error rate performance of the GLDPC codes, combined with a complementary outer code, has been shown to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art code and decoder designs with suitable lengths and rates for the 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) regime. A major drawback of these codes is that it is not known how to construct appropriate polynomial matrices to encode them efficiently. In this paper, we analyze practical constructions of quasi-cyclic GLDPC (QC-GLDPC) codes and show how to construct polynomial generator matrices in various forms using minors of the polynomial matrix. The approach can be applied to fully generalized matrices or partially generalized (with mixed constraint node types) to find better performance/rate trade-offs. The resulting encoding matrices are presented in useful forms that facilitate efficient implementation. The rich substructure displayed also provides us with new methods of determining low weight codewords, providing lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance and often giving those of weight equal to the minimum distance. Based on the minors of the polynomial parity-check matrix, we also give a formula for the rank of any parity-check matrix representing a QC-LDPC or QC-GLDPC code, and hence, the dimension of the code. Finally, we show that by applying double graph-liftings, the code parameters can be improved without affecting the ability to obtain a polynomial generator matrix.</description>

      <title>Realistic Evaluation of Impedance-Based RIS Modeling: Practical Insights and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications, offering energy-efficient control of electromagnetic (EM) waves. While conventional RIS models based on phase shifts and amplitude adjustments have been widely studied, they overlook complex EM phenomena such as mutual coupling, which are crucial for advanced wave manipulations. Recent efforts in EM-consistent modelling have provided more accurate representations of RIS behavior, highlighting challenges like structural scattering-an unwanted signal reflection that can lead to interference. In this paper, we analyze the impact of structural scattering in RIS architectures and compare traditional and EM-consistent models through full-wave simulations, thus providing practical insights on the realistic performance of current RIS designs. Our findings reveal the limitations of current modelling approaches in mitigating this issue, underscoring the need for new optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Duality on group algebras over finite chain rings: applications to additive group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ and an extension of finite chain rings $S|R$, one can consider the group rings $\mathscr{S} = S[G]$ and $\mathscr{R} = R[G]$. The group ring $\mathscr{S}$ can be viewed as an $R$-bimodule, and any of its $R$-submodules naturally inherits an $R$-bimodule structure; in the framework of coding theory, these are called \emph{additive group codes}, more precisely a (left) additive group code of is a linear code which is the image of a (left) ideal of a group algebra via an isomorphism which maps $G$ to the standard basis of $S^n$, where $n=|G|$. In the first part of the paper, the ring extension $S|R$ is studied, and several $R$-module isomorphisms are established for decomposing group rings, thereby providing a characterization of the structure of additive group codes. In the second part, we construct a symmetric, nondegenerate trace-Euclidean inner product on $\mathscr{S}$. Two additive group codes $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ form an \emph{additive complementary pair} (ACP) if $\mathcal{C} + \mathcal{D} = \mathscr{S}$ and $\mathcal{C} \cap \mathcal{D} = \{0\}$. For two-sided ACPs, we prove that the orthogonal complement of one code under the trace-Euclidean duality is precisely the image of the other under an involutive anti-automorphism of $\mathscr{S}$, linking coding-theoretical ACPs with module orthogonal direct-sum decompositions, representation theory, and the structure of group algebras over finite chain rings.</description>

      <title>Structured Superposition of Autoencoders for UEP Codes at Intermediate Blocklengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) coding that enables differentiated reliability levels within a transmitted message is essential for modern communication systems. Autoencoder (AE)-based code designs have shown promise in the context of learned equal error protection (EEP) coding schemes. However, their application to UEP remains largely unexplored, particularly at intermediate blocklengths, due to the increasing complexity of AE-based models. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding in conventional UEP schemes, we propose a structured AE-based architecture that extends AE-based UEP codes to substantially larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training. By structuring encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, our method provides a flexible framework for fine-tuning UEP reliability levels while adapting to diverse system parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed approach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed structured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for next-generation wireless networks, rendering the computation of rate-distortion trade-off in ISAC systems critically important. In this paper, we propose the extended Arimoto-Blahut (AB) algorithms to calculate the rate-distortion trade-off in bistatic ISAC systems, which overcome the limitation of existing AB algorithms in handling non-convex constraints. Specifically, we introduce auxiliary variables to transform non-convex distortion constraints into linear constraints, prove that the reformulated linearly-constrained optimization problem maintains the same optimal solution as the original problem, and develop extended AB algorithms for both squared error and logarithmic loss distortion metrics based on the framework of AB algorithm. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Control with Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) has emerged as a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks with enhanced adaptability through resource allocation co-design and intelligent environment awareness. However, dynamic interference and channel attenuation constrain the potential of the ISCC system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel movable antenna-empowered ISCC system. An achievable data rate maximization problem is formulated while guaranteeing the sensing and control quality-of-service (QoS) by optimizing the positions of the antennas and the beamforming strategy for communication, sensing, and control co-design. An efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AO-based algorithm achieves substantial gains in the achievable data rate and the control QoS compared with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization in Goal-Oriented Communication with Processing and Cost of Actuation Error Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a goal-oriented communication system in which a source monitors an environment that evolves as a discrete-time, two-state Markov chain. At each time slot, a controller decides whether to sample the environment and if so whether to transmit a raw or processed sample, to the controller. Processing improves transmission reliability over an unreliable wireless channel, but incurs an additional cost. The objective is to minimize the long-term average age of information (AoI), subject to constraints on the costs incurred at the source and the cost of actuation error (CAE), a semantic metric that assigns different penalties to different actuation errors. Although reducing AoI can potentially help reduce CAE, optimizing AoI alone is insufficient, as it overlooks the evolution of the underlying process. For instance, faster source dynamics lead to higher CAE for the same average AoI, and different AoI trajectories can result in markedly different CAE under identical average AoI. To address this, we propose a stationary randomized policy that achieves an average AoI within a bounded multiplicative factor of the optimal among all feasible policies. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to characterize system behavior under a range of parameters. These results offer insights into the feasibility of the optimization problem, the structure of near-optimal actions, and the fundamental trade-offs between AoI, CAE, and the costs involved.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However, current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical digital systems.</description>

      <title>Random Modulation: Achieving Asymptotic Replica Optimality over Arbitrary Norm-Bounded and Spectrally Convergent Channel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random modulation technique that is decoupled from the channel matrix, allowing it to be applied to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. The proposed random modulation constructs an equivalent dense and random channel matrix, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. It also guarantees the asymptotic replica maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit-error rate (BER) optimality of approximate message passing (AMP)-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices when their state evolution has a unique fixed point. Then, a low-complexity cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for random modulation, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the random transform-domain channel. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation schemes are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random-modulated linear systems, assuming the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. Numerical results show that the proposed random modulation can achieve BER and block-error rate (BLER) performance gains of up to 2 - 3 dB compared to existing OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with 5G-NR LDPC codes, under both average and optimized power allocation.</description>

      <title>PROPS: Progressively Private Self-alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms. Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD), provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy, which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval, Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based alignment.</description>

      <title>Secure Transmission for Cell-Free Symbiotic Radio Communications with Movable Antenna: Continuous and Discrete Positioning Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided cell-free symbiotic radio (SR) system. Specifically, the MAs deployed at distributed access points (APs) work collaboratively with the RIS to establish high-quality propagation links for both primary and secondary transmissions, as well as suppressing the risk of eavesdropping on confidential primary information. We consider both continuous and discrete MA position cases and maximize the secrecy rate of primary transmission under the secondary transmission constraints, respectively. For the continuous position case, we propose a two-layer iterative optimization method based on differential evolution with one-in-one representation (DEO), to find a high-quality solution with relatively moderate computational complexity. For the discrete position case, we first extend the DEO based iterative framework by introducing the mapping and determination operations to handle the characteristic of discrete MA positions. To further reduce the computational complexity, we then design an alternating optimization (AO) iterative framework to solve all variables within a single layer. In particular, we develop an efficient strategy to derive the sub-optimal solution for the discrete MA positions, superseding the DEO-based method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered secure transmission scheme along with its optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System Design with LoS Blockage: Does In-Waveguide Attenuation Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature of pinching-antenna systems, in-waveguide attenuation is often neglected to simplify system design and enable more tractable analysis. However, its effect on overall system performance has received limited attention in the existing literature. While a recent study has shown that, in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated environments, the data rate loss incurred by omitting in-waveguide attenuation is negligible when the communication area is not excessively large, its effect under more general conditions remains unclear. This work extends the analysis to more realistic scenarios involving arbitrary levels of LoS blockage. We begin by examining a single-user case and derive an explicit expression for the average data rate loss caused by neglecting in-waveguide attenuation. The results demonstrate that, even for large service areas, the rate loss remains negligible under typical LoS blockage conditions. We then consider a more general multi-user scenario, where multiple pinching antennas, each deployed on a separate waveguide, jointly serve multiple users. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by jointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the average sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting stochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample average approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces the expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically regenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization accurately reflects the current antenna configuration. Extensive simulation results are provided to the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the substantial performance gains of pinching-antenna systems, particularly in environments with significant LoS blockage.</description>

      <title>SGD Convergence under Stepsize Shrinkage in Low-Precision Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$, which slows convergence when $q_{\min} &lt; 1$. Under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.</description>

      <title>Graded Quantum Codes: From Weighted Algebraic Geometry to Homological Chain Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG) codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted heights.The second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors.
  A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon &gt; 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields.
  Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Remote Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks. However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and \emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.</description>

      <title>Importance-Aware Semantic Communication in MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel importance-aware quantization, subcarrier mapping, and power allocation (IA-QSMPA) framework for semantic communication in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, empowered by a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). The proposed framework exploits attention-based importance extracted from a pretrained ViT to jointly optimize quantization levels, subcarrier mapping, and power allocation. Specifically, IA-QSMPA maps semantically important features to high-quality subchannels and allocates resources in accordance with their contribution to task performance and communication latency. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, a block coordinate descent algorithm is employed. The framework is further extended to operate under finite blocklength transmission, where communication errors may occur. In this setting, a segment-wise linear approximation of the channel dispersion penalty is introduced to enable efficient joint optimization under practical constraints. Simulation results on a multi-view image classification task using the MVP-N dataset demonstrate that IA-QSMPA significantly outperforms conventional methods in both ideal and finite blocklength transmission scenarios, achieving superior task performance and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning over Wireless Networks with Homomorphic State Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and capacity limitations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning for IRS-Assisted Wireless Networks: Securing Opportunistic Communications Against Byzantine Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO) in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP) surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound (UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through joint learning.</description>

      <title>Multi-head Transformers Provably Learn Symbolic Multi-step Reasoning via Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</description>

Abstract: 6G standardization is to start imminently, with commercial deployments expected before 2030. Its technical components and performance requirements are the focus of this article. Our emphasis is on the 6G radio access, especially MIMO, AI, waveforms, coding, signal constellations and integration with non-terrestrial networks. Whilst standardization has not yet formally started, the scope of the 6G study items has been defined. Our predictions in this paper are speculative as there are no results of the study yet, but our views are guided by implementation and deployment aspects. We expect that the views here will guide researchers and industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Composable Quantum Fault-Tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework, with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Distributed Linearly Separable Computation under Cyclic Assignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the master-worker distributed linearly separable computation problem, where the considered computation task, referred to as linearly separable function, is a typical linear transform model widely used in cooperative distributed gradient coding, real-time rendering, linear transformers, etc. %A master asks $\Nsf$ distributed workers to compute a linearly separable function from $\Ksf$ datasets. The computation task on $\Ksf$ datasets can be expressed as $\Ksf_{\rm c}$ linear combinations of $\Ksf$ messages, where each message is the output of an individual function on one dataset. Straggler effect is also considered, such that from the answers of any $\Nsf_{\rm r}$ of the $\Nsf$ distributed workers, the master should accomplish the task. The computation cost is defined as the number of datasets assigned to each worker, while the communication cost is defined as the number of (coded) messages that should be received. The objective is to characterize the optimal tradeoff between the computation and communication costs. The problem has remained so far open, even under the cyclic data assignment.Since in fact various distributed computing schemes were proposed in the literature under the cyclic data assignment, with this paper we close the problem for the cyclic assignment. This paper proposes a new computing scheme with the cyclic assignment based on the concept of interference alignment, by treating each message which cannot be computed by a worker as an interference from this worker. Under the cyclic assignment, the proposed computing scheme is then proved to be optimal when $\Nsf=\Ksf$ and be order optimal within a factor of $2$ otherwise.</description>

      <title>Bounds on f-Divergences between Distributions within Generalized Quasi-$\varepsilon$-Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes computable bounds between f-divergences for probability measures within a generalized quasi-$\varepsilon_{(M,m)}$-neighborhood framework. We make the following key contributions. (1) a unified characterization of local distributional proximity beyond structural constraints is provided, which encompasses discrete/continuous cases through parametric flexibility. (2) First-order differentiable $f$-divergence classification with Taylor-based inequalities is established, which generalizes $\chi^2$-divergence results to broader function classes. (3) We provide tighter reverse Pinsker's inequalities than existing ones, bridging asymptotic analysis and computable bounds. The proposed framework demonstrates particular efficacy in goodness-of-fit test asymptotics while maintaining computational tractability.</description>

      <title>Capacity Bounds for Broadcast Channels with Bidirectional Conferencing Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-user broadcast channel (BC) with receivers connected by bidirectional cooperation links of finite capacities, known as conferencing decoders, is considered. A novel capacity region outer bound is established based on multiple applications of the Csisz\'{a}r-K\"{o}rner identity. Achievable rate regions are derived by using Marton's coding as the transmission scheme, together with different combinations of decode-and-forward and quantize-bin-and-forward strategies at the receivers. It is shown that the outer bound coincides with the achievable rate region for a new class of semi-deterministic BCs with degraded message sets; for this class of channels, one-round cooperation is sufficient to achieve the capacity. Capacity result is also derived for a class of more capable semi-deterministic BCs with both common and private messages and one-sided conferencing. For the Gaussian BC with conferencing decoders, if the noises at the decoders are perfectly correlated (i.e., correlation is either 1 or -1), the new outer bound yields exact capacity region for two cases: i) BC with degraded message sets; ii) BC with one-sided conferencing from the weaker receiver to the stronger receiver. When the noises have arbitrary correlation, the outer bound is shown to be within half a bit from the capacity region for these same two cases. Finally, for the general Gaussian BC, a one-sided cooperation scheme based on decode-and-forward from the stronger receiver to the weaker receiver is shown to achieve the capacity region to within $\frac{1}{2}\log (\frac{2}{1-|\lambda|})$ bits, where $\lambda$ is the noise correlation. An interesting implication of these results is that for a Gaussian BC with perfectly negatively correlated noises and conferencing decoders with finite cooperation link capacities, it is possible to achieve a strictly positive rate using only an infinitesimal amount of transmit power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation from coarsely quantized data. We focus on a two-step approach which first estimates the signal subspace via covariance estimation and then extracts DOA angles by the ESPRIT algorithm. In particular, we analyze two stochastic quantization schemes which use dithering: a one-bit quantizer combined with rectangular dither and a multi-bit quantizer with triangular dither. For each quantizer, we derive rigorous high probability bounds for the distances between the true and estimated signal subspaces and DOA angles. Using our analysis, we identify scenarios in which subspace and DOA estimation via triangular dithering qualitatively outperforms rectangular dithering. We verify in numerical simulations that our estimates are optimal in their dependence on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the target matrix. The resulting subspace estimation guarantees are equally applicable in the analysis of other spectral estimation algorithms and related problems.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of Locally Perfect Nonlinear Functions and Their Application to Sequence Sets With Low Ambiguity Zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Ambiguity Zone (LAZ) sequences play a pivotal role in modern integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Recently, Wang \textit{et al.} [arXiv:2501.11313] proposed a definition of locally perfect nonlinear functions (LPNFs) and constructed three classes of both periodic and aperiodic LAZ sequence sets with flexible parameters by applying such functions and interleaving techniques. Some of these LAZ sequence sets are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Ye-Zhou-Fan-Liu-Lei-Tang bounds under certain conditions. In this paper, we present constructions of three new classes of LPNFs with new parameters. Based on these LPNFs, we further propose a series of LAZ sequence sets that offer more flexible parameters. Furthermore, our results show that some of these classes are asymptotically optimal in both the periodic and aperiodic cases, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We provide a polynomial approach to investigate linear complementary dual (LCD) quasi-cyclic codes over finite fields. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for LCD quasi-cyclic codes of index 2 with respect to the Euclidean, Hermitian, and symplectic inner products. As a consequence of these characterizations, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for LCD one-generator quasi-cyclic codes. Furthermore, using these characterizations, we construct some new quasi-cyclic LCD codes over small fields.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Static IRS: 3D Shaped Beamforming for Area Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising paradigm to reconfigure the wireless environment for enhanced communication coverage and quality. However, to compensate for the double pathloss effect, massive IRS elements are required, raising concerns on the scalability of cost and complexity. This paper introduces a new architecture of quasi-static IRS (QS-IRS), which tunes element phases via mechanical adjustment or manually re-arranging the array topology. QS-IRS relies on massive production/assembly of purely passive elements only, and thus is suitable for ultra low-cost and large-scale deployment to enhance long-term coverage. To achieve this end, an IRS-aided area coverage problem is formulated, which explicitly considers the element radiation pattern (ERP), with the newly introduced shape masks for the mainlobe, and the sidelobe constraints to reduce energy leakage. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the difference-of-convex (DC) and successive convex approximation (SCA) procedure is proposed, which achieves shaped beamforming with power gains close to that of the joint optimization algorithm, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: We consider the discrete-time Schr\"odinger bridge problem on a finite state space. Although it has been known that the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm converges in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ground truth solution, the speed of that convergence remained unquantified. In this work, we establish for the first time that IMF exhibits exponential convergence with an explicit contraction factor.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\epsilon_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions about the covariate as long as the covariate is bounded, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions of the covariates such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions on the covariates. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions on the bounded covariate. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the set of lumpable Markov chains over a finite state space, with respect to a fixed lumping function, generally does not form an exponential family of stochastic matrices. In this work, we explore efficiently verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for families of lumpable transition matrices to form exponential families. To this end, we develop a broadly applicable dimension-based method for determining whether a given family of stochastic matrices forms an exponential family.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the construction of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, ubiquitous connectivity has been achieved. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are mainly deployed in specific urban areas and use licensed spectrum. However, in remote areas where terrestrial infrastructure is sparse, licensed spectrum bands are often underutilized. To accommodate the increasing communication needs, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) can opportunistically access this idle spectrum to improve spectrum efficiency via spectrum sharing (SS). Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. In satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to manage mutual interference between NTN and TN effectively. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of SS in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

      <title>PersianMedQA: Evaluating Large Language Models on a Persian-English Bilingual Medical Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .</description>

      <title>Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics, including the minimization of variational and expected free energy, naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.</description>

Abstract: The coupled entropy is proven to correct a flaw in the derivation of the Tsallis entropy and thereby solidify the theoretical foundations for analyzing the uncertainty of complex systems. The Tsallis entropy originated from considering power probabilities $p_i^q$ in which \textit{q} independent, identically-distributed random variables share the same state. The maximum entropy distribution was derived to be a \textit{q}-exponential, which is a member of the shape ($\kappa$), scale ($\sigma$) distributions. Unfortunately, the $q$-exponential parameters were treated as though valid substitutes for the shape and scale. This flaw causes a misinterpretation of the generalized temperature and an imprecise derivation of the generalized entropy. The coupled entropy is derived from the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and the Student's t distribution, whose shape derives from nonlinear sources and scale derives from linear sources of uncertainty. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$, which makes it too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy provides perfect balance, ranging from $\ln \sigma$ for $\kappa=0$ to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. Examples of complex systems design including a coupled variation inference algorithm are reviewed.</description>
