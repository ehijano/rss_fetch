      <title>Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo: A Machine Learning View on Control Variate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being an essential tool across engineering and finance, Monte Carlo simulation can be computationally intensive, especially in large-scale, path-dependent problems that hinder straightforward parallelization. A natural alternative is to replace simulation with machine learning or surrogate prediction, though this introduces challenges in understanding the resulting errors.We introduce a Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo (PEMC) framework where we leverage machine learning prediction as control variates, thus maintaining unbiased evaluations instead of the direct use of ML predictors. Traditional control variate methods require knowledge of means and focus on per-sample variance reduction. In contrast, PEMC aims at overall cost-aware variance reduction, eliminating the need for mean knowledge. PEMC leverages pre-trained neural architectures to construct effective control variates and replaces computationally expensive sample-path generation with efficient neural network evaluations. This allows PEMC to address scenarios where no good control variates are known. We showcase the efficacy of PEMC through two production-grade exotic option-pricing problems: swaption pricing in HJM model and the variance swap pricing in a stochastic local volatility model.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Asset Price Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider volume weighted average price (VWAP) as the 1st market-based statistical moment and derive the dependence of higher statistical moments of price on statistical moments and correlations of the values and volumes of market trades. If all trade volumes are constant during the averaging interval, then the market-based statistical moments equal the frequency-based. We approximate market-based probability of price by a finite number of statistical moments. The use of VWAP results in zero price-volume correlations. We derive the expressions of market-based correlations between prices and squares of trade volumes and between squares of prices and volumes. To forecast market-based averages and volatility of asset prices, one should predict two statistical moments and the correlation of their trade values and volumes. We explain how that limits the number of predicted statistical moments of prices by the first two and limits the accuracy of the forecasts of the probability of asset prices by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the accuracy and reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like those developed by BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of asset prices.</description>
