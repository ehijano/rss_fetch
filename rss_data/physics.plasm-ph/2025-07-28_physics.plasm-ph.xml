      <title>An ignition criterion for inertial fusion boosted by microturbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence enhances fusion reactivity, enabling ignition at lower temperature. A modified Lawson-like ignition criterion is derived for inertially confined plasmas harboring turbulent kinetic energy. Remarkably, if small-scale turbulence is driven in the hot spot while avoiding mixing at the boundary, less energy is required to ignite a target. The optimal length scale for hot-spot turbulence is quantified, typically lying in the micron range.</description>

      <title>Dynamically phase-separated states in driven binary dusty plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comprehensively study external forcing-driven dynamical structure formation in a binary dusty plasma mixture. Using two-dimensional driven-dissipative molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate phase segregation into bands and lanes beyond a critical forcing threshold. The particles interact via the Debye-H\"uckel potential, with interaction strength serving as a control parameter for determining the critical forcing. During early evolution, the results exhibit features of two-stream instability. A steady-state phase-space diagram indicates that bands and lanes emerge beyond a critical forcing and coupling strength. Lanes predominantly form under high external forcing. Multiple independent diagnostics, including the order parameter, drift velocity, diffusion coefficients, domain size, and the final-to-initial coupling strength ratio, provide insight into phase segregation and help determine the critical forcing amplitude. Furthermore, we show that the time evolution of band and lane widths follows an exponent of 1/3 for both critical and off-critical mixtures. These findings contrast with the previously reported scaling of 1/2 for equilibrium phase separation in critical mixtures. These results help bridge the gap between dusty plasmas and colloidal systems and facilitate controlled dusty plasma experiments in this direction.</description>

      <title>Enhanced performance in quasi-isodynamic max-$J$ stellarators with a turbulent particle pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent stellarator reactor designs demonstrate mostly outward turbulent particle transport, which, without advanced fueling technology, inhibits the formation of density gradients needed for confinement. We introduce ``SQuID-$\tau$'', a self-fueling quasi-isodynamic stellarator capable of sustaining density peaking through inward particle transport caused by turbulence. Temperature and density profile predictions based on high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations demonstrate enhanced performance, significantly relaxing constraints on the size and magnetic field strength for reactor designs.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Positive Corona Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of corona discharges, the complex chemical mechanisms inside the ionization region have prompted the development of simplified models to replicate the macroscopic effects of ion generation, thereby reducing the computational effort, especially in two and three dimensional simulations. We propose a methodology that allows to replace the ionization process with appropriate boundary conditions used by a corona model solving the drift region. We refer to this model as macro-scale, since it does not solve the ionization region. Our approach begins with one dimensional computations in cylindrical coordinates of the whole discharge, where we include a fairly detailed model of the plasma region near the emitter. We refer to this model as full-scale, since all the spatial scales, including the ionization region, are properly taken into account. From these results it is possible to establish boundary conditions for macroscopic simulations. The idea is that, given an emitter radius, the boundary conditions can be used for a variety of geometries that leverage on that emitter as active electrode. Our results agree with available experimental data for positive corona discharges in different configurations and with simplified analytical models from literature.</description>

      <title>Perturbative model for the saturation of energetic-particle-driven modes limited by self-generated zonal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified approach enforcing energy conservation to incorporate the effects of zonal modes alongside wave-particle nonlinearities in the determination of the saturation amplitude. The model assumes that the zonal perturbations grow at a rate twice that of the original (pump) wave, consistent with a beat-driven (or force-driven) generation mechanism. The evolution and saturation of the mode amplitude are investigated both analytically and numerically within our reduced model assumptions, in both the collisionless and scattering-dominated regimes. These studies underscore the crucial role of sources and sinks in accurately capturing the impact and the role of beat-driven zonal perturbations on mode evolution. In the realistic case of saturation set by sources and sinks, we discuss the role of a finite amplitude zonal mode in reducing microturbulent particle scattering, thus limiting the energy source for the resonant mode. We then discuss comparisons between the model predictions and simulation results. The model reproduces key features observed in gyrokinetic simulations as the reduction in saturated mode amplitude and the onset of wave-wave nonlinear effects as functions of mode growth rate and amplitude. Thanks to its simplicity, it can be readily implemented into codes based on reduced models, thereby improving their predictive capability for strongly driven instabilities.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Velocity-Space Signature of Ion Cyclotron Damping Using Liouville Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion cyclotron damping is a key mechanism for the dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy in weakly collisional plasmas. This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfv\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\parallel, v_\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\perp$ dependence on $\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray transport in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of cosmic-ray transport in multi-phase diffusive media is developed, with the specific application to cases in which the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient has large spatial fluctuations that may be inherently multi-scale. We demonstrate that the resulting transport of cosmic rays is diffusive in the long-time limit, with an average diffusion coefficient equal to the harmonic mean of the spatially varying diffusion coefficient. Thus, cosmic-ray transport is dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively small, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time scales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a result of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through high-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show that the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is controlled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each of the phases. We finally show that, despite strongly influencing the confinement times, the multi-phase medium is only capable of altering the energy dependence of cosmic-ray transport when there is a moderate (but not excessive) level of perpendicular diffusion across magnetic-field lines.</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Liquids in Heterogeneous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body correlations in strongly coupled liquids and plasmas are critical for many applications in nanofluids, biology, and fusion-related plasma physics, but their description in fully heterogeneous environments remains challenging due to the high-dimensional equations involved. Recently, tensor network decompositions have emerged as powerful tools for tackling such equations by reducing memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we solve for equilibrium density and density-density correlation functions of liquids in confined heterogeneous environments using tensor network methods. We demonstrate that these functions admit high compression when their lengthscale dependence is encoded via quantized tensor trains or when their spatial-coordinate dependence is represented in standard tensor-train format, but not with respect to their dependence on distinct particle coordinates.</description>

      <title>ThinCurr: An open-source 3D thin-wall eddy current modeling code for the analysis of large-scale systems of conducting structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new thin-wall eddy current modeling code, ThinCurr, for studying inductively-coupled currents in 3D conducting structures -- with primary application focused on the interaction between currents flowing in coils, plasma, and conducting structures of magnetically-confined plasma devices. The code utilizes a boundary finite element method on an unstructured, triangular grid to accurately capture device structures. The new code, part of the broader Open FUSION Toolkit, is open-source and designed for ease of use without sacrificing capability and speed through a combination of Python, Fortran, and C/C++ components. Scalability to large models is enabled through use of hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank compression of the inductance matrix, which is otherwise dense. Ease of handling large models of complicated geometry is further supported by automatic determination of supplemental elements through a greedy homology approach. A detailed description of the numerical methods of the code and verification of the implementation of those methods using cross-code comparisons against the VALEN code and Ansys commercial analysis software is shown.</description>

      <title>General kinetic ion induced electron emission model for metallic walls applied to biased Z-pinch electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model for general applications is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. We assume an ionization cascade mechanism and use empirical models for the ion and electron stopping powers. The emission spectrum and the secondary electron yield (SEY) are validated for a variety of materials. The IIEE model is used to study the effect of IIEE on the plasma-material interactions of Z-pinch electrodes. Un-magnetized Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a Z-pinch plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 to 9 kV. At the anode, the SEY decreases from 0 to 1 kV, but then increases at higher bias potentials. At the cathode, the SEY is much larger due to higher energy ion bombardment and grows with bias potential. As the bias potential increases, the emitted cathode electrons are accelerated to higher energies into the domain collisionally heating the plasma. Above 1 kV, the heating is strong enough to increase the plasma potential. Despite SEY greater than 1, only a classical sheath forms as opposed to a space-charge limited or inverse sheath due to the emitted electron flux not reaching the space charge current saturation limits. Furthermore, the current in the emissionless cases saturates to a value lower than experiment. With IIEE, the current does not saturate and continues to increase with the 4 kV case matching most closely with experiment.</description>

      <title>Neural operator surrogate models of plasma edge simulations: feasibility and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion of high-fidelity simulations of SOL turbulence and transient MHD events such as ELMs in highly iterative applications remains computationally prohibitive, limiting their use in design and control workflows. Understanding these phenomena is vital, as they govern heat flux on plasma-facing components, influencing reactor performance and material lifetime. This study explored FNOs as surrogate models to accelerate plasma simulations from the JOREK MHD and STORM turbulence codes.
  FNOs were trained on single-step rollouts and evaluated in terms of long-term predictive accuracy in an auto-regressive manner. To mitigate the computational burden of dataset generation, a transfer learning strategy was explored, leveraging low-fidelity simulations to improve performance on high-fidelity datasets. These results showed that FNOs effectively captured initial plasma evolution, including blob movement and density source localization. However, long rollouts accumulated errors and exhibited sensitivity to certain physical phenomena, leading to non-monotonic error spikes. Transfer learning significantly reduced errors for small dataset sizes and short rollouts, achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction when transfering from low- to high-fidelity datasets. However, its effectiveness diminished with longer rollouts and larger dataset sizes, especially when applied to datasets with significantly different dynamics. Attempts to transfer models to previously unseen variables in simulations were unsuccessful, underscoring the limitations in this context.
  These findings demonstrate the promise of NOs for accelerating fusion-relevant PDE simulations. However, they also highlight key challenges: improving long-term accuracy to mitigate error accumulation, capturing critical physical behaviors, and developing robust surrogates that effectively leverage multi-fidelity, multi-physics datasets.</description>

      <title>From the Rose-DuBois Ansatz of Hot Spot Fields to the Instanton Solution: a Pedestrian Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a pedestrian presentation of some technical results recently published in mathematical physics with non-trivial implications for laser-plasma interaction. The aim is to get across the main results without going into the details of the calculations, nor offering a specialist's user guide, but by focusing conceptually on how these results modify the commonly-held description -- in terms of laser hot spot fields -- of backscattering instabilities with a spatially smoothed laser beam. The intended readers are plasma physicists as well as graduate students interested in laser-plasma interaction. No prior knowledge of scattering instabilities is required. Step by step, we explain how the laser hot spots are gradually replaced with other structures, called instantons, as the amplification of the scattered light increases. In the amplification range of interest for laser-plasma interaction, instanton--hot spot complexes tend to appear in the laser field (in addition to the expected hot spots), with a non-negligible probability. For even larger amplifications and systems longer than a hot spot length, the hot spot field description is clearly invalidated by the instanton takeover.</description>
