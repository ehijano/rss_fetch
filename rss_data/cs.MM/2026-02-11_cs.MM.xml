      <title>TAROT: Towards Optimization-Driven Adaptive FEC Parameter Tuning for Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward Error Correction (FEC) remains essential for protecting video streaming against packet loss, yet most real deployments still rely on static, coarse-grained configurations that cannot react to rapid shifts in loss rate, goodput, or client buffer levels. These rigid settings often create inefficiencies: unnecessary redundancy that suppresses throughput during stable periods, and insufficient protection during bursty losses, especially when shallow buffers and oversized blocks increase stall risk. To address these challenges, we present TAROT, a cross-layer, optimization-driven FEC controller that selects redundancy, block size, and symbolization on a per-segment basis. TAROT is codec-agnostic--supporting Reed-Solomon, RaptorQ, and XOR-based codes--and evaluates a pre-computed candidate set using a fine-grained scoring model. The scoring function jointly incorporates transport-layer loss and goodput, application layer buffer dynamics, and block-level timing constraints to penalize insufficient coverage, excessive overhead, and slow block completion. To enable realistic testing, we extend the SABRE simulator 1 with two new modules: a high-fidelity packet-loss generator that replays diverse multi-trace loss patterns, and a modular FEC benchmarking layer supporting arbitrary code/parameter combinations. Across Low-Latency Live (LLL) and Video-on-Demand (VoD) streaming modes, diverse network traces, and multiple ABR algorithms, TAROT reduces FEC overhead by up to 43% while improving perceptual quality by 10 VMAF units with minimal rebuffering, achieving a stronger overhead-quality balance than static FECs.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deterministic Framework for Named Entity Extraction in Broadcast News Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.
  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.</description>

      <title>Smaller is Better: Generative Models Can Power Short Video Preloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preloading is widely used in short video platforms to minimize playback stalls by downloading future content in advance. However, existing strategies face a tradeoff. Aggressive preloading reduces stalls but wastes bandwidth, while conservative strategies save data but increase the risk of playback stalls. This paper presents PromptPream, a computation powered preloading paradigm that breaks this tradeoff by using local computation to reduce bandwidth demand. Instead of transmitting pixel level video chunks, PromptPream sends compact semantic prompts that are decoded into high quality frames using generative models such as Stable Diffusion. We propose three core techniques to enable this paradigm: (1) a gradient based prompt inversion method that compresses frames into small sets of compact token embeddings; (2) a computation aware scheduling strategy that jointly optimizes network and compute resource usage; and (3) a scalable searching algorithm that addresses the enlarged scheduling space introduced by scheduler. Evaluations show that PromptStream reduces both stalls and bandwidth waste by over 31%, and improves Quality of Experience (QoE) by 45%, compared to traditional strategies.</description>

      <title>Camel: Frame-Level Bandwidth Estimation for Low-Latency Live Streaming under Video Bitrate Undershooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency live streaming (LLS) has emerged as a popular web application, with many platforms adopting real-time protocols such as WebRTC to minimize end-to-end latency. However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon: even when the actual encoded bitrate does not fully utilize the available bandwidth, stalling events remain frequent. This insufficient bandwidth utilization arises from the intrinsic temporal variations of real-time video encoding, which cause conventional packet-level congestion control algorithms to misestimate available bandwidth. When a high-bitrate frame is suddenly produced, sending at the wrong rate can either trigger packet loss or increase queueing delay, resulting in playback stalls.
  To address these issues, we present Camel, a novel frame-level congestion control algorithm (CCA) tailored for LLS. Our insight is to use frame-level network feedback to capture the true network capacity, immune to the irregular sending pattern caused by encoding. Camel comprises three key modules: the Bandwidth and Delay Estimator and the Congestion Detector, which jointly determine the average sending rate, and the Bursting Length Controller, which governs the emission pattern to prevent packet loss.
  We evaluate Camel on both large-scale real-world deployments and controlled simulations. In the real-world platform with 250M users and 2B sessions across 150+ countries, Camel achieves up to a 70.8% increase in 1080P resolution ratio, a 14.4% increase in media bitrate, and up to a 14.1% reduction in stalling ratio. In simulations under undershooting, shallow buffers, and network jitter, Camel outperforms existing congestion control algorithms, with up to 19.8% higher bitrate, 93.0% lower stalling ratio, and 23.9% improvement in bandwidth estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards Training-free Multimodal Hate Localisation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.</description>

      <title>Stemphonic: All-at-once Flexible Multi-stem Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music stem generation, the task of producing musically-synchronized and isolated instrument audio clips, offers the potential of greater user control and better alignment with musician workflows compared to conventional text-to-music models. Existing stem generation approaches, however, either rely on fixed architectures that output a predefined set of stems in parallel, or generate only one stem at a time, resulting in slow inference despite flexibility in stem combination. We propose Stemphonic, a diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates a variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as a batch element, group synchronized stems in a batch, and apply a shared noise latent to each group. At inference-time, we use a shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of a mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that Stemphonic produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 25 to 50%.

      <title>Controllable Dance Generation with Style-Guided Motion Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dance plays an important role as an artistic form and expression in human culture, yet automatically generating dance sequences is a significant yet challenging endeavor. Existing approaches often neglect the critical aspect of controllability in dance generation. Additionally, they inadequately model the nuanced impact of music styles, resulting in dances that lack alignment with the expressive characteristics inherent in the conditioned music. To address this gap, we propose Style-Guided Motion Diffusion (SGMD), which integrates the Transformer-based architecture with a Style Modulation module. By incorporating music features with user-provided style prompts, the SGMD ensures that the generated dances not only match the musical content but also reflect the desired stylistic characteristics. To enable flexible control over the generated dances, we introduce a spatial-temporal masking mechanism. As controllable dance generation has not been fully studied, we construct corresponding experimental setups and benchmarks for tasks such as trajectory-based dance generation, dance in-betweening, and dance inpainting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic and stylistically consistent dances, while also empowering users to create dances tailored to diverse artistic and practical needs.

      <title>OmniMER: Auxiliary-Enhanced LLM Adaptation for Indonesian Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indonesian, spoken by over 200 million people, remains underserved in multimodal emotion recognition research despite its dominant presence on Southeast Asian social media platforms. We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework. The dataset and code are publicly available. https://github.com/yanxm01/INDOMER</description>
