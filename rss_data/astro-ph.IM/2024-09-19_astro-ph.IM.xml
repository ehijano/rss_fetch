      <title>Did WISE detect Dyson Spheres/Structures around Gaia-2MASS-selected stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soon after the release of the WISE all-sky catalogue of 500 million mid-infrared (IR) objects, suggestions were made that it could be used to search for extrasolar devices constructed by an advanced civilization to convert a significant fraction of their host star's luminosity into useful work: "technostructures", "megastructures" or "Dyson spheres/structures", hereafter DSMs, whose inevitable waste heat would be seen by WISE at mid-IR wavelengths. However, a trawl of several million potentially-habitable Gaia-detected stars for mid-IR-excess signatures is fraught with danger, due to both noise from such a large sample and, more importantly, confusion with the emission from dusty background galaxies. In light of a recent claim of seven potential DSMs in MNRAS, a brief rebuttal appeared on arXiv. Further to this response, the relevance of WISE-detected galaxies is discussed in more detail, leading to a seemingly tight limit on the number and lifetime of DSMs, and indeed intelligent worlds, in the ~600-pc-radius region patrolled by Gaia. However, the detectability of DSMs is questioned: a DSM might extinguish its star at optical/near-IR wavelengths, and thus either not appear or appear anomalously faint in a stellar catalogue. Moreover, a civilization advanced enough to construct a DSM is likely to be advanced enough to use countermeasures to mask its presence from us.</description>

      <title>High performance Lunar landing simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous precision navigation to land onto the Moon relies on vision sensors. Computer vision algorithms are designed, trained and tested using synthetic simulations. High quality terrain models have been produced by Moon orbiters developed by several nations, with resolutions ranging from tens or hundreds of meters globally down to few meters locally. The SurRender software is a powerful simulator able to exploit the full potential of these datasets in raytracing. New interfaces include tools to fuse multi-resolution DEMs and procedural texture generation. A global model of the Moon at 20m resolution was integrated representing several terabytes of data which SurRender can render continuously and in real-time. This simulator will be a precious asset for the development of future missions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive particle refinement for compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce adaptive particle refinement for compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). SPH calculations have the natural advantage that resolution follows mass, but this is not always optimal. Our implementation allows the user to specify local regions of the simulation that can be more highly resolved. We test our implementation on practical applications including a circumbinary disc, a planet embedded in a disc and a flyby. By comparing with equivalent globally high resolution calculations we show that our method is accurate and fast, with errors in the mass accreted onto sinks of less than 9 percent and speed ups of 1.07-6.62 times for the examples shown. Our method is adaptable and easily extendable, for example with multiple refinement regions or derefinement.</description>

      <title>CuRIOS-ED: The Technology Demonstrator for the CubeSats for Rapid Infrared and Optical Surveys Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of time-domain astronomy including electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves, gravitational microlensing, explosive phenomena, and even astrometry with Gaia, are showing the power and need for surveys with high-cadence, large area, and long time baselines to study the transient universe. A constellation of SmallSats or CubeSats providing wide, instantaneous sky coverage down to 21 Vega mag at optical wavelengths would be ideal for addressing this need. We are assembling CuRIOS-ED (CubeSats for Rapid Infrared and Optical Survey--Exploration Demo), an optical telescope payload which will act as a technology demonstrator for a larger constellation of several hundred 16U CubeSats known as CuRIOS. In preparation for CuRIOS, CuRIOS-ED will launch in late 2025 as part of the 12U Starspec InspireSat MVP payload. CuRIOS-ED will be used to demonstrate the StarSpec ADCS pointing capabilities to &lt;1" and to space-qualify a commercial camera package for use on the full CuRIOS payload. The CuRIOS-ED camera system will utilize a Sony IMX455 CMOS detector delivered in an off-the-shelf Atik apx60 package which we modified to be compatible with operations in vacuum as well as the CubeSat form factor, power, and thermal constraints. By qualifying this commercial camera solution, the cost of each CuRIOS satellite will be greatly decreased (~100x) when compared with current space-qualified cameras with IMX455 detectors. We discuss the CuRIOS-ED mission design with an emphasis on the disassembly, repackaging, and testing of the Atik apx60 for space-based missions. Characterization of the apx60's read noise, dark current, patterned noise, and thermal behavior are reported for a range of temperatures (-35 C to 40 C) and exposure times (0.001s to 30 s). Additionally, we comment on preliminary environmental testing results from a successful thermal vacuum test.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Calibrator Grid at 600MHz for Fast Radio Transient Localizations with CHIME/FRB Outriggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project has a new VLBI Outrigger at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO), which forms a 3300km baseline with CHIME operating at 400-800MHz. Using 100ms long full-array baseband "snapshots" collected commensally during FRB and pulsar triggers, we perform a shallow, wide-area VLBI survey covering a significant fraction of the Northern sky targeted at the positions of compact sources from the Radio Fundamental Catalog. In addition, our survey contains calibrators detected from two 1s long trial baseband snapshots for a deeper survey with CHIME and GBO. In this paper, we present the largest catalog of compact calibrators suitable for 30-milliarcsecond-scale VLBI observations at sub-GHz frequencies to date. Our catalog consists of 200 total calibrators in the Northern Hemisphere that are compact on 30-milliarcsecond scales with fluxes above 100mJy. This calibrator grid will enable the precise localization of hundreds of FRBs a year with CHIME/FRB-Outriggers.</description>

      <title>The MDW H{\alpha} Sky Survey: Data Release 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated and ongoing all-sky imaging survey in the narrowband H$\alpha$ wavelength. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers, and is presented here in its first stage of refinement for rigorous scientific use. Each field is exposed through an H$\alpha$ filter with a 3nm bandwidth for a total of four hours, with a pixel scale of 3.2 arcsec. Here, we introduce the first Data Release of the MDW H$\alpha$ Survey (Data Release 0, or DR0), spanning 238 fields in the region of Orion (~3100 deg$^2$). DR0 includes: calibrated mean fields, star-removed mean fields, a point source catalog matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), and mosaics.</description>

      <title>orbitize! v3: Orbit fitting for the High-contrast Imaging Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).</description>

      <title>Denoising medium resolution stellar spectra with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We trained denoiser autoencoding neural networks on medium resolution simulated optical spectra of late-type stars to demonstrate that the reconstruction of the original flux is possible at a typical relative error of a fraction of a percent down to a typical signal-to-noise ratio of 10 per pixel. We show that relatively simple networks are capable of learning the characteristics of stellar spectra while still flexible enough to adapt to different values of extinction and fluxing imperfections that modifies the overall shape of the continuum, as well as to different values of Doppler shift. Denoised spectra can be used to find initial values for traditional stellar template fitting algorithms and - since evaluation of pre-trained neural networks is significantly faster than traditional template fitting - denoiser networks can be useful when a fast analysis of the noisy spectrum is necessary, for example during observations, between individual exposures.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of source-blending impact on the calibration of SKA EoR experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twenty-one-centimetre signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are expected to be detected in the low-frequency radio window by the next-generation interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). However, precision data analysis pipelines are required to minimize the systematics within an infinitesimal error budget. Consequently, there is a growing need to characterize the sources of errors in EoR analysis. In this study, we identify one such error origin, namely source blending, which is introduced by the overlap of objects in the densely populated observing sky under SKA1-Low's unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, and evaluate its two-fold impact in both the spatial and frequency domains using a novel hybrid evaluation (HEVAL) pipeline combining end-to-end simulation with an analytic method to mimic EoR analysis pipelines. Sky models corrupted by source blending induce small but severe frequency-dependent calibration errors when coupled with astronomical foregrounds, impeding EoR parameter inference with strong additive residuals in the two-dimensional power spectrum space. We report that additive residuals from poor calibration against sky models with blending ratios of 5 and 0.5 per cent significantly contaminate the EoR window. In contrast, the sky model with a 0.05 per cent blending ratio leaves little residual imprint within the EoR window, therefore identifying a blending tolerance at approximately 0.05 per cent. Given that the SKA observing sky is estimated to suffer from an extended level of blending, strategies involving de-blending, frequency-dependent error mitigation, or a combination of both, are required to effectively attenuate the calibration impact of source-blending defects.</description>

      <title>Bright unintended electromagnetic radiation from second-generation Starlink satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the detection of unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR) from the second-generation of Starlink satellites. Observations with the LOFAR radio telescope between 10 to 88MHz and 110 to 188MHz show broadband emission covering the frequency ranges from 40 to 70MHz and 110 to 188MHz from the v2-Mini and v2-Mini Direct-to-Cell Starlink satellites. The spectral power flux density of this broadband UEMR varies from satellite to satellite, with values ranging from 15Jy to 1300Jy, between 56 and 66MHz, and from 2 to 100Jy over two distinct 8MHz frequency ranges centered at 120 and 161MHz. We compared the detected power flux densities of this UEMR to that emitted by the first generation v1.0 and v1.5 Starlink satellites. When correcting for the observed satellite distances, we find that the second-generation satellites emit UEMR that is up to a factor of 32 stronger compared to the first generation. The calculated electric field strengths of the detected UEMR exceed typical electromagnetic compatibility standards used for commercial electronic devices as well as recommended emission thresholds from the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-R) aimed at protecting the 150.05-153MHz frequency range allocated to radio astronomy. We characterize the properties of the detected UEMR with the aim of assisting the satellite operator with the identification of the cause of the UEMR.</description>

      <title>Likelihood reconstruction of radio signals of neutrinos and cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays are excellent probes of astroparticle physics phenomena. For astroparticle physics analyses, robust and accurate reconstruction of signal parameters like arrival direction and energy is essential. Current reconstruction methods ignore bin-to-bin noise correlations, which limits reconstruction resolution and so far has prevented calculations of event-by-event uncertainties. In this work, we present a likelihood description of neutrino or cosmic-ray signals in a radio detector with correlated noise, as present in all neutrino and cosmic-ray radio detectors. We demonstrate with a toy-model reconstruction that signal parameters such as energy and direction, including event-by-event uncertainties with correct coverage, can be obtained. Additionally, by correctly accounting for correlations, the likelihood description constrains the best-fit parameters better than alternative methods and thus improves experimental reconstruction capabilities.</description>

      <title>AHKASH: a new Hybrid particle-in-cell code for simulations of astrophysical collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{A}$strophysical $\texttt{H}$ybrid-$\texttt{K}$inetic simulations with the $\texttt{flASH}$ code ($\texttt{AHKASH}$) -- a new Hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed within the framework of the multi-physics code $\texttt{FLASH}$. The new code uses a second-order accurate Boris integrator and a predictor-predictor-corrector algorithm for advancing the Hybrid-kinetic equations, using the constraint transport method to ensure that magnetic fields are divergence-free. The code supports various interpolation schemes between the particles and grid cells, with post-interpolation smoothing to reduce finite particle noise. We further implement a $\delta f$ method to study instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas. The new code is tested on standard physical problems such as the motion of charged particles in uniform and spatially varying magnetic fields, the propagation of Alfv\'en and whistler waves, and Landau damping of ion acoustic waves. We test different interpolation kernels and demonstrate the necessity of performing post-interpolation smoothing. We couple the $\texttt{TurbGen}$ turbulence driving module to the new Hybrid PIC code, allowing us to test the code on the highly complex physical problem of the turbulent dynamo. To investigate steady-state turbulence with a fixed sonic Mach number, it is important to maintain isothermal plasma conditions. Therefore, we introduce a novel cooling method for Hybrid PIC codes and provide tests and calibrations of this method to keep the plasma isothermal. We describe and test the `hybrid precision' method, which significantly reduces (by a factor $\sim1.5$) the computational cost, without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, we test the parallel scalability of the new code, showing excellent scaling up to 10,000~cores.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Spectroscopy for Planetary Sciences: Mid-IR Absorption Made Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system still has many unanswered questions. Formation of solids in the solar system, mineral and organic mixing, and planetary body creation are all topics of interest to the community. Studying these phenomena is often performed through observations, remote sensing, and in-situ analysis, but there are limitations to the methods. Limitations such as IR diffraction limits, spatial resolution issues, and spectral resolution issues can prevent detection of organics, detection and identification of cellular structures, and the disentangling of granular mixtures. Optical-PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) spectroscopy is a relatively new method of spectroscopy currently used in fields other than planetary sciences. O-PTIR is a non-destructive, highly repeatable, and fast form of measurement capable of reducing these limitations. Using a dual laser system with an IR source tuned to the mid-IR wavelength we performed laboratory O-PTIR measurements to compare O-PTIR data to existing IR absorption data and laboratory FTIR measurements for planetary materials. We do this for the purpose of introducing O-PTIR to the planetary science community. The technique featured here would serve to better measurements of planetary bodies during in-situ analysis. We find that, unlike other fields where O-PTIR produces almost one-to-one measurements with IR absorption measurements of the same material, granular materials relevant to planetary science do not. However, we do find that the materials compared were significantly close and O-PTIR was still capable of identifying materials relevant to planetary science.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: HI source-finding with a machine learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11668v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data volumes generated by the WALLABY atomic Hydrogen (HI) survey using the Australiian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) necessitate greater automation and reliable automation in the task of source-finding and cataloguing. To this end, we introduce and explore a novel deep learning framework for detecting low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) HI sources in an automated fashion. Specfically, our proposed method provides an automated process for separating true HI detections from false positives when used in combination with the Source Finding Application (SoFiA) output candidate catalogues. Leveraging the spatial and depth capabilities of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our method is specifically designed to recognise patterns and features in three-dimensional space, making it uniquely suited for rejecting false positive sources in low SNR scenarios generated by conventional linear methods. As a result, our approach is significantly more accurate in source detection and results in considerably fewer false detections compared to previous linear statistics-based source finding algorithms. Performance tests using mock galaxies injected into real ASKAP data cubes reveal our method's capability to achieve near-100% completeness and reliability at a relatively low integrated SNR~3-5. An at-scale version of this tool will greatly maximise the science output from the upcoming widefield HI surveys.</description>

      <title>SWEET-Cat: A view on the planetary mass-radius relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SWEET-Cat (Stars With ExoplanETs Catalogue) was originally introduced in 2013, and since then, the number of confirmed exoplanets has increased significantly. A crucial step for a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and homogeneous characterization of their host stars. We used a large number of high-resolution spectra to continue the addition of new stellar parameters for planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat following the new detection of exoplanets listed both at the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive. We obtained high-resolution spectra for a significant number of these planet-host stars, either observed by our team or collected through public archives. For FGK stars, the spectroscopic stellar parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES+MOOG as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. The stellar properties are combined with the planet properties to study possible correlations that could shed more light into the star-planet connection studies. We increase the number of stars with homogeneous parameters by 232 ($\sim$ 25\% - from 959 to 1191). We then focus on the exoplanets with both mass and radius determined to review the mass-radius relation where we find consistent results with the ones previously reported in the literature. For the massive planets we also revisit the radius anomaly where we confirm a metallicity correlation for the radius anomaly already hinted in previous results.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Accretion is all about Sub-Keplerian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the advantages of fitting with a Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) which uses only four physical parameters. We then present the results of hydrodynamic simulations to highlight the fact that the primary component of a black hole accretion remains the sub-Keplerian or the low angular momentum flow independent of whether we have a high, intermediate or low mass X-ray binary. Every aspect of spectral and timing properties, including the disk-jet connection could be understood well only if such a component is present along with a Keplerian component of variable size and accretion rate.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements with Enhanced Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$ arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here, we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$) assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an iterative reconstruction method in comparison of the standard reconstruction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a new, iterative density reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm uses a decreasing smoothing scale to better reconstruct the density field in Lagrangian space. We implement this algorithm to run on the Quijote simulations, and extend it to (a) include a smoothing kernel that smoothly goes from anisotropic to isotropic, and (b) a variant that does not correct for redshift space distortions. We compare the performance of this algorithm with the standard reconstruction method. Our examinations of the methods include cross-correlation of the reconstructed density field with the linear density field, reconstructed two-point functions, and BAO parameter fitting. We also examine the impact of various parameters, such as smoothing scale, anisotropic smoothing, tracer type/bias, and the inclusion of second order perturbation theory. We find that the two reconstruction algorithms are comparable in most of the areas we examine. In particular, both algorithms give consistent fittings of BAO parameters. The fits are robust over a range of smoothing scales. We find the iterative algorithm is significantly better at removing redshift space distortions. The new algorithm will be a promising method to be employed in the ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES), complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity. Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>
