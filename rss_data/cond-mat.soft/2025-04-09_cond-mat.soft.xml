      <title>On the interfacial properties of hydroquinone: realistic and coarse-grained molecular models from computer simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the vapor-liquid (VL) coexistence and interfacial properties of the hydroquinone (HQ) pure system from $NVT$ molecular dynamics simulations. We employ the direct coexistence technique to put in contact both phases in the same simulation box and generate the VL interface. Five different models have been tested to describe the HQ molecule in order to assess the performance of different approaches. The first two models are based on the Transferable Parameters Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE) force field. The first TraPPE model is the original one based on an all-atoms approach (TraPPE-AA). The second TraPPE model is proposed for the first time in this work and is based on a united-atoms approach (TraPPE-UA) where the --CH groups from the aromatic ring are modeled as a single interaction site. We also use two HQ models based on the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force fields. Both OPLS models have already been reported in the literature, but this is the first time that are used to describe VLE and interfacial behavior. In addition, we propose a new Coarse grain (CG) HQ model based on the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) framework. We determine density profiles, coexistence densities, vapor pressure, interfacial thicknesses, and interfacial tensions as obtained from the $NVT$ simulations with the five different models. We explore the VL behavior of pure HQ system from 500 to $750\,\text{K}$. Remarkably good agreement has been found between the simulation results obtained by the TraPPE-AA, CG, and both OPLS models.</description>

      <title>Localization of deformation in the central hub of hub-and-spoke kirigami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent approach to the design of flexible electronic devices consists of cutting a two-dimensional sheet to form a central hub connected to several tapered `spokes', resembling the hub-and-spoke of a bicycle wheel. When radially compressed, the resulting cut sheet buckles out-of-plane forming a structure whose three-dimensional shape can be chosen by designing the tapering of the spokes. While the deformation of the spokes in this `hub-and-spoke' kirigami are approximately cylindrical (i.e.~zero Gaussian curvature and hence small elastic strain), this is not the case in the central hub. The central hub is deformed radially because of continuity with the spokes but, because of its own circular symmetry, it must develop Gaussian curvature, and hence strain. In this article we quantify this strain, focussing in particular on its magnitude and its location. We find that the strain is localized in a boundary layer near the edge of the hub region, whose size is controlled by the moment applied on it by the deformed spokes. We discuss the implications of our results for avoiding material failure in flexible-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids by analyzing crystal deformations through non-affine fluctuations. A scaling law for non-affinity is derived, showing it scales quadratically with activity and inversely with density. At high activity, the non-affine parameter diverges, signaling defect proliferation and melting to a hexatic phase. This softening is marked by reduced shear modulus, solid order, and hexatic order. At a higher activity, the hexatic melts to a fluid. We propose locally tuned activity to control non-affinity, demonstrated through numerical simulations. Our predictions are testable in active colloids performing persistent random motion.</description>

      <title>Kinetic phase diagram for two-step nucleation in colloid-polymer mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-step crystallization via a metastable intermediate phase is often regarded as a non-classical process that lies beyond the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we investigate two-step crystallization in colloid-polymer mixtures via an intermediate liquid phase. Using CNT-based seeding simulations, we construct a kinetic phase diagram that identifies regions of phase space where the critical nucleus is either liquid or crystalline. These predictions are validated using transition path sampling simulations at nine different relevant state points. When the critical nucleus is liquid, crystallization occurs stochastically during the growth phase, whereas for a crystalline critical nucleus, the crystallization process happens pre-critically at a fixed nucleus size. We conclude that CNT-based kinetic phase diagrams are a powerful tool for understanding and predicting `non-classical' crystal nucleation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for fluidic flocks in interacting active colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. Here, we report a flocking transition sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities in a system of chemically interacting colloidal particles. The basic requirements to sustain the flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques, with the time scale individual colloids move a unit length being dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. The generality of this phenomenon is displayed for a range of attractive translational forces to which the flock is robust. We rationalize these results with a phenomenological hydrodynamical model.</description>

      <title>Have you tried turning it off and on again? Stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used across chemistry, physics, and biology, providing quantitative insight into complex processes with atomic detail. However, their limited timescale of a few microseconds is a significant obstacle in describing phenomena such as conformational transitions of biomolecules and polymorphism in molecular crystals. Recently, stochastic resetting, i.e., randomly stopping and restarting the simulations, emerged as a powerful enhanced sampling approach, which is collective variable-free, highly parallelized, and easily implemented in existing molecular dynamics codes. Resetting expedites sampling rare events while enabling the inference of kinetic observables of the underlying process. It can be employed as a standalone tool or in combination with other enhanced sampling methods, such as Metadynamics, with each technique compensating for the drawbacks of the other. Here, we comprehensively describe resetting and its theoretical background, review recent developments in stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling, and provide instructive guidelines for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Transport of electrolytes across nanochannels: the role of slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the electrokinetic flow due to the transport of electrolytes embedded in nanochannels of varying cross-section with inhomogeneous slip on their walls, modeled as an effective slip length on the channel wall. We show that, within linear response and Debye-Huckel regime, the transport coefficients, and so the fluxes, can be significantly improved by the presence of a hydrophobic surface coating located at the narrowest section of the nanochannel. Our model indicates that the enhancement is larger when considering electric conductive walls in comparison to dielectric microchannel walls, and it is produced by a synergy between the entropic effects due to the geometry and the presence of the slip boundary layer. Our results show that a tailored hydrophobic coating design can be an effective strategy to improve transport properties in the broad areas of lab-on-a-chip, biophysics, and blue energy harvesting and energy conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Harnessing non-equilibrium forces to optimize work extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While optimal control theory offers effective strategies for minimizing energetic costs in noisy microscopic systems over finite durations, a significant opportunity lies in exploiting the temporal structure of non-equilibrium forces. We demonstrate this by presenting exact analytical forms for the optimal protocol and the corresponding work for any driving force and protocol duration. We also derive a general quasistatic bound on the work, relying only on the coarse-grained, time-integrated characteristics of the applied forces. Notably, we show that the optimal protocols often automatically act as information engines that harness information about non-equilibrium forces and an initial state measurement to extract work. These findings chart new directions for designing adaptive, energy-efficient strategies in noisy, time-dependent environments, as illustrated through our examples of periodic driving forces and active matter systems. By exploiting the temporal structure of non-equilibrium forces, this largely unexplored approach holds promise for substantial performance gains in microscopic devices operating at the nano- and microscale.</description>

      <title>Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers: Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</description>

      <title>Behavior of water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in cylindrical silica pores: A wide temperature range molecular dynamics simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report here a molecular dynamics simulation study on water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in 1.6 nm cylindrical pores of silica to investigate a dynamical cross-over, observed earlier experimentally, wherein LiCl slows down confined water at high temperatures but makes it faster at lower temperatures. The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.</description>
