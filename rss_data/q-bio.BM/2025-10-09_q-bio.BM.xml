      <title>Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking. Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently, qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and molecular glues.</description>

      <title>GTP before ATP: The energy currency at the origin of genes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Life is an exergonic chemical reaction. Many individual reactions in metabolism entail slightly endergonic steps that are coupled to free energy release, typically as ATP hydrolysis, in order to go forward. ATP is almost always supplied by the rotor-stator ATP synthase, which harnesses chemiosmotic ion gradients. Because the ATP synthase is a protein, it arose after the ribosome did. What was the energy currency of metabolism before the origin of the ATP synthase and how (and why) did ATP come to be the universal energy currency? About 27% of a cell's energy budget is consumed as GTP during translation. The universality of GTP-dependence in ribosome function indicates that GTP was the ancestral energy currency of protein synthesis. The use of GTP in translation and ATP in small molecule synthesis are conserved across all lineages, representing energetic compartments that arose in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA. And what came before GTP? Recent findings indicate that the energy supporting the origin of LUCA's metabolism stemmed from H2-dependent CO2 reduction along routes that strongly resemble the reactions and transition metal catalysts of the acetyl-CoA pathway.</description>

      <title>Unified Cross-Scale 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregressive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D structure modeling is essential across scales, enabling applications from fluid simulation and 3D reconstruction to protein folding and molecular docking. Yet, despite shared 3D spatial patterns, current approaches remain fragmented, with models narrowly specialized for specific domains and unable to generalize across tasks or scales. We propose Uni-3DAR, a unified autoregressive framework for cross-scale 3D generation and understanding. At its core is a coarse-to-fine tokenizer based on octree data structures, which compresses diverse 3D structures into compact 1D token sequences. We further propose a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. To address the challenge of dynamically varying token positions introduced by compression, we introduce a masked next-token prediction strategy that ensures accurate positional modeling, significantly boosting model performance. Extensive experiments across multiple 3D generation and understanding tasks, including small molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals, and macroscopic 3D objects, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster.</description>
