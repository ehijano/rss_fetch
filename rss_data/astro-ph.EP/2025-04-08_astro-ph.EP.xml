      <title>Radial variations in nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen fractionation in the PDS 70 planet-hosting disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Element isotopic ratios are powerful tools to reconstruct the journey of planetary material, from the parental molecular cloud to protoplanetary disks, where planets form and accrete their atmosphere. Radial variations in isotopic ratios in protoplanetary disks reveal local pathways which can critically affect the degree of isotope fractionation of planetary material. In this work we present spatially-resolved profiles of the 14N/15N, 12C/13C, and D/H isotopic ratios of the HCN molecule in the PDS 70 disk, which hosts two actively-accreting giant planets. ALMA high spatial resolution observations of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, and DCN reveal radial variations of fractionation profiles. We extract the HCN/HC15N ratio out to ~120 au, which shows a decreasing trend outside the inner cavity wall of the PDS 70 disk located at ~50 au. We suggest that the radial variations observed in the HCN/HC15N ratio are linked to isotope selective photodissociation of N2. We leverage the spectrally resolved hyperfine component of the HCN line to extract the radial profile of the HCN/H13CN ratio between ~40 and 90 au, obtaining a value consistent with the ISM 12C/13C ratio. The deuteration profile is also mostly constant throughout the disk extent, with a DCN/HCN ratio ~0.02, in line with other disk-averaged values and radial profiles in disks around T Tauri stars. The extracted radial profiles of isotopologue ratios show how different fractionation processes dominate at different spatial scales in the planet-hosting disk of PDS 70.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}}. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}} with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}} (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 \% (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Parallax Measurements with JWST for Localization of Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in simultaneous observations with an Earth-based telescope for parallax measurements to tightly constrain the orbital trajectory of hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). We demonstrate the significant reduction in localization error with varying epochs of observation at the potential time-of-impact via a Monte Carlo simulated case study of 2024 YR4, an Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid. By leveraging the L2-Earth baseline and the considerable parallax angles formed, we highlight the unexplored potential for improved localization of NEOs through parallax observations with JWST.</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas giant planets, if present, are the most massive objects in a planetary system and play a pivotal role in shaping its overall architecture. The formation of these planets has constantly been a central issue in planetary science. Increasing evidence from spacecraft explorations of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as telescope observations of exoplanets, has provided new constraints on the formation process of gas giant planets. The classic challenge of explaining formation timescales still remains a significant issue, while new constraints on planetary interiors have introduced additional complexities. Recent shifts away from the single-size planetesimal hypothesis, nevertheless, show promise in resolving these problems. Additionally, various discoveries regarding exoplanets have led to theoretical improvements, while the discovery of numerous super-Earths and sub-Neptunes has posed new challenges in understanding gas accretion. This review synthesizes the latest theoretical advancements, discussing resolved issues and emerging challenges in giant planet formation.</description>

      <title>A tri-static ground-based laser ranging method for precise satellite attitude determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accurately determine the rotation rate and spin axis of active satellites during deployment, during phases of uncertain operations (e.g. loss of control, potential fuel leaks) and particularly for defunct satellites to assess suitability of removal of space objects by active debris removal is increasingly important. Conventional techniques, such as optical photometry, face challenges in providing precise attitude information. In this work, we propose a tri-static ground-based satellite laser ranging (SLR) approach combined with three onboard laser retroreflectors for precise satellite attitude determination. Via this approach our method achieves true 3D triangulation of the reflectors' positions in space, enabling a highly accurate estimation of the satellite's attitude. This multi-station configuration overcomes limitations of existing single-station SLR techniques that rely on indirect inference, e.g. Fourier analysis of range residuals, or lead to multiple possible attitude solutions. We demonstrate through simulations that our approach can estimate the spin rate and axis of a satellite with high precision, on the order of 0.1 deg/sec and 1 deg, respectively. Notably, this can be done with data from only a single pass and does not require observation of a whole satellite rotation period. We show how the layout of retroreflectors are paramount to the effectiveness of the method. We provide placement strategies to maximize attitude determination performance to allow operators to incorporate retroreflectors effectively into their own satellites. These contributions lay the groundwork for a complete ground-based solution for attitude determination, significantly improving current methods and directly supporting ADR efforts.</description>

      <title>Plasma and Thermal Processing Leading to Spatial and Temporal Variability of the Trapped O2 at Europa and Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe physical processes affecting the formation, trapping, and outgassing of molecular oxygen (O2) at Europa and Ganymede. Following Voyager measurements of their ambient plasmas, laboratory data indicated that the observed ions were supplied by and would in turn impact and sputtering their surfaces, decomposing the ice and producing thin O2 atmospheres. More than a decade later, Europa's ambient O2 was inferred from observations of the O aurora and condensed O2 bands at 5773 and 6275 angstroms were observed in Ganymede's icy surface. More than another decade later, the O2 atmosphere was shown to have a dusk/dawn enhancement, confirmed by Juno data. Although the incident plasma produces these observables, processes within the surface are still not well understood. Here we note that incident plasma produces a non-equilibrium defect density in the surface grains. Subsequent diffusion leads to the formation of voids and molecular products, some of which are volatile. Although some volatiles are released into their atmospheres, others are trapped at defects or in voids forming gas bubbles, which might be delivered to their subsurface oceans. Here we discuss how trapping competes with annealing of the radiation damage. We describe differences observed at Europa and Ganymede and roughly determine the trend with latitude of O2 bands on Ganymede's trailing hemisphere. This understanding is used to discuss the importance of condensed and adsorbed O2 as atmospheric sources, accounting for dusk/dawn enhancements and temporal variability reported in condensed O2 band depths. Since plasma and thermal annealing timescales affect the observed O2 variability on all of the icy moons, understanding the critical physical processes of O2 can help determine the evolution of other detected oxidants often suggested to be related to geological activity and venting.</description>

      <title>Bioverse: Potentially Observable Exoplanet Biosignature Patterns Under the UV Threshold Hypothesis for the Origin of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of scenarios for the origin of life have been proposed, with many influencing the prevalence and distribution of biosignatures across exoplanet populations. This relationship suggests these scenarios can be tested by predicting biosignature distributions and comparing them with empirical data. Here, we demonstrate this approach by focusing on the cyanosulfidic origins-of-life scenario and investigating the hypothesis that a minimum near-ultraviolet (NUV) flux is necessary for abiogenesis. Using Bayesian modeling and the \bioverse\ survey simulator, we constrain the probability of obtaining strong evidence for or against this ``UV Threshold Hypothesis'' with future biosignature surveys.
  Our results indicate that a correlation between past NUV flux and current biosignature occurrence is testable for sample sizes of $\gtrsim$50 planets. The diagnostic power of such tests is critically sensitive to the intrinsic abiogenesis rate and host star properties, particularly maximum past NUV fluxes. Surveys targeting a wide range of fluxes, and planets orbiting M dwarfs enhance the chances of conclusive results, with sample sizes $\gtrsim$100 providing $\gtrsim$80\% likelihood of strong evidence if abiogenesis rates are high and the required NUV fluxes are moderate. For required fluxes exceeding a few hundred erg/s/cm$^2$, both the fraction of inhabited planets and the diagnostic power sharply decrease.
  Our findings demonstrate the potential of exoplanet surveys to test origins-of-life hypotheses. Beyond specific scenarios, this work underscores the broader value of realistic survey simulations for future observatories (e.g., HWO, LIFE, ELTs, Nautilus) in identifying testable science questions, optimizing mission strategies, and advancing theoretical and experimental studies of abiogenesis.</description>

      <title>EclipseNETs: Learning Irregular Small Celestial Body Silhouettes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting eclipse events around irregular small bodies is crucial for spacecraft navigation, orbit determination, and spacecraft systems management. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural implicit representations to model eclipse conditions efficiently and reliably. We propose neural network architectures that capture the complex silhouettes of asteroids and comets with high precision. Tested on four well-characterized bodies - Bennu, Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Eros - our method achieves accuracy comparable to traditional ray-tracing techniques while offering orders of magnitude faster performance. Additionally, we develop an indirect learning framework that trains these models directly from sparse trajectory data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, removing the requirement to have prior knowledge of an accurate shape model. This approach allows for the continuous refinement of eclipse predictions, progressively reducing errors and improving accuracy as new trajectory data is incorporated.</description>

      <title>Dust Growth in ALMA Rings: II. Dusty Rossby Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annular substructures serve as ideal venues for planetesimal formation. In this series, we investigate the linear stage of dust growth within rings. The first paper examines the global streaming instability, while this study focuses on the dusty Rossby wave instability (DRWI). We perform a linear analysis of the two-fluid equations on a background pressure bump, representing annular substructures. The spectral code \textsc{Dedalus} is used to solve the linear eigenvalue problem. We identify two distinct DRWI modes: Type I, which originates from dust-modified gas RWI, and Type II, which results from dust-gas coupling. These modes never coexist for a given azimuthal wavenumber $\ky$, but transition between each other as $\ky$ varies. Type I modes are driven by the advection of background vorticity, whereas Type II modes involve two primary waves: Rossby waves, driven by advection, and thin waves, driven by dust-gas drag. Finally, we assess the relevance of DRWI in ALMA rings using DSHARP sources. Our findings suggest that Type I modes could explain the absence of azimuthal asymmetries in many ALMA disks, whereas Type II modes are entirely absent in all eight observed rings, implying that unresolved narrow rings or alternative mechanisms may play a role in dust growth within annular substructures.</description>

      <title>Formation of Near-surface Atmospheric Inversion and Surface Inversion in Hothouse Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hothouse climate may develop throughout Earth's history and its warming future and on potentially habitable exoplanets near the inner edge of the habitable zone. Previous studies suggested that near-surface atmospheric inversion (NAIV) with planetary boundary air temperature being higher than the air temperature adjacent to the surface, is a pronounced phenomenon in hothouse climates. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that lower-tropospheric radiative heating is necessary but not independently sufficient in forming the NAIV. Instead, the dynamic heating induced by large-scale subsidence is essential. With the prescribed reasonable large-scale subsidence, NAIV appears in small-domain cloud-resolving simulations, which was not observed in previous studies. Surface evaporative cooling also contributes to the formation of the NAIV. Besides NAIV, we find that surface inversion (SIV) with the air adjacent to the surface being warmer than the underlying sea surface is also a distinct phenomenon in hothouse climates. SIV is caused by strong surface evaporative cooling and large atmospheric shortwave absorption. These two types of inversion strongly stabilize the atmosphere, weaken atmospheric circulation, dry the free troposphere, and suppress the hydrological cycle.</description>

      <title>JWST Reveals Spectral Tracers of Recent Surface Modification on Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europa has been modified by a variety of geologic processes, exposing internally-derived materials that are heavily irradiated by charged particles trapped in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Prior spectral analysis of H2O ice on Europa relied on low signal-to-noise data at wavelengths &gt;2.5 microns, limiting assessment of a 3.1 micron Fresnel peak that is diagnostic of exposed crystalline ice. We report new measurements of H2O ice spectral features using high signal-to-noise data collected by the NIRSpec spectrograph (1.48 - 5.35 microns) on the James Webb Space Telescope. These data reveal a narrow 3.1 micron crystalline H2O ice Fresnel peak, which is primarily located at southern latitudes in Tara and Powys Regiones. Our analysis indicates that crystalline ice exposed in these low-latitude regiones is likely sustained by ongoing thermal (re)crystallization outpacing charged particle amorphization of the top 10 microns of Europa's regolith over short timescales (&lt;15 days). We also measured H2O ice features centered near 1.5 microns, 1.65 microns, and 2.0 microns, and a broad 3.6 micron H2O continuum peak, which are all stronger at northern latitudes, in contrast to the 3.1 micron Fresnel peak identified at southern latitudes. These results support the hypothesis that H2O ice in Europa's regolith is vertically stratified, with amorphous ice grains dominating its exposed surface, except in Tara and Powys Regiones. We also find that a previously detected 4.38 micron 13O2 feature is present almost exclusively at southern latitudes in Tara and Powys Regiones, likely derived from an internal source of carbon-bearing material.</description>

      <title>Strong ionospheric activity at the MWA site associated with plasma bubble measured by GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's ionosphere refracts radio signals, shifting the apparent position of radio sources. Wide-field measurements with a radio interferometer can measure the ionospheric distortion. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has the ability to capture ionospheric structures that are smaller than 100 km in extent. We report unusually strong ionospheric activity in MWA data during a magnetic storm on 2023 December 1. The duct-like structure (roughly 50 km $\times$ $&gt;$100 km) passes through the MWA field-of-view (FOV) with a velocity of ~ 100 m/s. The offsets of the apparent position of the radio source are more than 1 degree in the MWA observation data at around 180 MHz. By comparing the Total Electron Content (TEC) data obtained from the GNSS receiver network, we have found that the TEC fluctuations represented by a high Rate of TEC change index (ROTI) coincided with the strong ionospheric activity observed by the MWA. This result suggests that unusual ionospheric signatures detected by the MWA could be caused by plasma bubbles extending across Western Australia during a magnetic storm.</description>

Abstract: As we prepare for the next planetary mission charged with finding life beyond Earth, the Astrobiology community must continue to improve its understanding of what constitutes a biosignature, through the use of planetary analog samples. The study of these collected and generated samples is expanding our knowledge of what constitutes habitable environments, what life is capable of, and importantly, how to make biosignature detections within compositionally complex samples - aiding in the development of life detection instrumentation. And yet the full potential of these samples remains untapped. While the Astrobiology community possesses an incredible inventory of planetary analog samples, some incredibly precious, these are scattered across the country in individual freezers with varying degrees of documentation, curation practices, and contamination control. We, as a community, need to change the status quo of how we approach planetary analog research. One of the biggest actions we could take over the next 10 years to change that paradigm would be the creation of a sample repository for Astrobiology relevant materials, providing a centralized, well-curated, wealth of precious samples for the community. Such a collection would create a framework for material and meta-data submission that minimizes burden on the individual PIs, satisfying open data requirements; it would facilitate biosignature research, and aid in the creation of a robust life detection framework; support the development of a standardized sample reference suite for life detection instrumentation; and finally, aid in the development of techniques to be used for future sample return endeavors.</description>

      <title>Planetary World Coordinate System in Astropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different research communities are involved in planetary coordinate standardization. Geologists and Remote Sensing specialists work on extending Earth standards to Planets using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and coordinate descriptions endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Astronomers work to define Virtual Observatory (VO) metadata and FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) for planetary bodies. In this proceeding the implementation of the planetary WCS description in Astropy is described. The related new features are available starting from Astropy 6.0. The current work is part of a broader effort involving other consortia (e.g., heliophysics for Solar or magnetospheric reference frames), and focuses on body-fixed frames to support surface and atmosphere studies.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic magnetic field of the planet hosting Herbig Ae/Be star HD169142</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the accretion disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD169142 revealed its complex and asymmetric morphology indicating the presence of planets. The knowledge of the magnetic field structure in host stars is indispensable for our understanding of the magnetospheric interaction between the central stars, the circumstellar (CS) environment, and planetary companions. We intend to study the geometry of the magnetic field of HD169142. We measured the mean longitudinal magnetic field from high resolution ESPaDOnS and HARPSpol spectra of HD169142 using the Least Square Deconvolution technique. Additionally, the spectral variability of hydrogen lines is studied using dynamical spectra.
  Our analysis of the Stokes V spectra reveals the presence of definitely detected narrow Zeeman features observed using line masks with neutral iron lines. On two observing epochs, we also obtain marginally detected broad Zeeman features. To explain the simultaneous appearance of narrow and broad Zeeman features, we discuss different scenarios, including one scenario related to a non-photospheric origin of the narrow Zeeman features due to magnetospheric interaction with warm CS matter. In an environment such as a wind or an accretion disk, spectral lines may form over a relatively large volume, and the field topology may therefore be complex not only in latitude and azimuth, but in radius as well. Dynamical plots of the Hbeta line show an intriguing very complex structure with appearing and disappearing absorption features, which can be related to the complex morphology of the CS matter with asymmetric dust clump structures. The profiles of spectral lines belonging to different elements are variable, indicating the presence of chemical spots.</description>

      <title>Detecting relevant dependencies under measurement error with applications to the analysis of planetary system evolution</title>

Abstract: Exoplanets play an important role in understanding the mechanics of planetary system formation and orbital evolution. In this context the correlations of different parameters of the planets and their host star are useful guides in the search for explanatory mechanisms. Based on a reanalysis of the data set from \cite{figueria14} we study the as of now still poorly understood correlation between planetary surface gravity and stellar activity of Hot Jupiters. Unfortunately, data collection often suffers from measurement errors due to complicated and indirect measurement setups, rendering standard inference techniques unreliable.
  We present new methods to estimate and test for correlations in a deconvolution framework and thereby improve the state of the art analysis of the data in two directions. First, we are now able to account for additive measurement errors which facilitates reliable inference. Second we test for relevant changes, i.e. we are testing for correlations exceeding a certain threshold $\Delta$. This reflects the fact that small nonzero correlations are to be expected for real life data almost always and that standard statistical tests will therefore always reject the null of no correlation given sufficient data. Our theory focuses on quantities that can be estimated by U-Statistics which contain a variety of correlation measures. We propose a bootstrap test and establish its theoretical validity. As a by product we also obtain confidence intervals. Applying our methods to the Hot Jupiter data set from \cite{figueria14}, we observe that taking into account the measurement errors yields smaller point estimates and the null of no relevant correlation is rejected only for very small $\Delta$. This demonstrates the importance of considering the impact of measurement errors to avoid misleading conclusions from the resulting statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Exponential distance relation (aka Titius-Bode rule) in extra solar planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present phenomenological evidence for the validity of an exponential distance relation (also known as generalized Titius-Bode law) in the 32 planetary systems (31 extra solar, plus our Solar System) containing at least 5 planets each (known up to July 2023). We produce the semi-log fittings of the data, and we check them against the statistical indicators of $R^2$ and $Median$. Then we compare them with the data of 4000 artificial planetary systems created at random. In this way, a possible origin by chance of the Titius-Bode rule (TBR) is reasonably excluded. We also point out that in some systems the fittings can be definitely improved by the insertion of new planets into specific positions. We discuss the Harmonic Resonances method and fittings, and compare them with the Titius-Bode fittings. Moreover, for some specific systems, we compare the Titius-Bode fitting against a polynomial fitting ($r\sim n^2$). Further comparisons with previous relevant works are reported in the last section. It emerges that TBR describes 25 out of the 32 planetary systems ($78\%$) with a $R^2\geq 0.95$. Further, it results to be the most economical (in terms of free parameters) and best fitting law for the description of spacing among planetary orbits. This analysis allows us to conclude that an exponential distance relation can reasonably be considered as ``valid'', or strongly corroborated, also in extra solar planetary systems.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Living on the Wedge, or, NIRCam Bar Coronagraphy Reveals CO$_2$ in the HR 8799 and 51 Eri Exoplanets' Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-contrast observations with JWST can reveal key composition and vertical mixing dependent absorption features in the spectra of directly imaged planets across the 3-5 $\mu$m wavelength range. We present novel coronagraphic images of the HR 8799 and 51 Eri planetary systems using the NIRCam Long Wavelength Bar in an offset "narrow" position. These observations have revealed the four known gas giant planets encircling HR 8799, even at spatial separations challenging for a 6.5 m telescope in the mid-infrared, including the first ever detection of HR 8799 e at 4.6 $\mu$m. The chosen filters constrain the strength of CO, CH4, and CO2 absorption in each planet's photosphere. The planets display a diversity of 3-5 $\mu$m colors that could be due to differences in composition and ultimately be used to trace their formation history. They also show stronger CO2 absorption than expected from solar metallicity models, indicating that they are metal enriched. We detected 51 Eri b at 4.1 $\mu$m and not at longer wavelengths, which, given the planet's temperature, is indicative of out-of-equilibrium carbon chemistry and an enhanced metallicity. Updated orbits fit to the new measurement of 51 Eri b validate previous studies that find a preference for high eccentricities ($e{=}0.57_{-0.09}^{+0.03}$), which likely indicates some dynamical processing in the system's past. These results present an exciting opportunity to model the atmospheres and formation histories of these planets in more detail in the near future, and are complementary to future higher-resolution, continuum-subtracted JWST spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Stability of hierarchical triples comprising a central massive body and a tight binary: the effect of inner and outer eccentricities on the binary breakup condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the stability of gravitational triple systems comprising a central massive body and a tight binary of less massive pairs. In the present paper, we focus on improving the Hill-type stability criterion for the binary in those systems, with particular attention to the effects of the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. We perform direct Newtonian N-body simulations over much longer integration times than previous studies, which is essential to determine the stability and breakup timescale distributions of those systems in a reliable fashion. As a result, we obtain an empirical fitting formula of the binary breakup condition that incorporates effects of the inner and outer eccentricities, the mutual inclination of the inner and outer orbits, the mass ratios of the three bodies, and the breakup timescale.</description>
