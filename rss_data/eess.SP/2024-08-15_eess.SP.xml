      <title>Sharing and Compatibility Studies between International Mobile Telecommunications Systems (Mobile Cellular) and Earth-Exploration Satellite Service (active) in 10-10.5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The World Radiocommunications Conference 2023 (WRC-23), held in Dubai, intensively discussed several Agenda Items related to possible new International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) identifications of several radio frequency bands. One example of a frequency band is 10-10.5 GHz, which has a primary allocation to Radiolocation, Earth-Exploration Satellite services. In order to ensure continued protection of such incumbent services, sharing and compatibility studies were conducted, and debated at length, at the ITU-R Study Groups from the year 2020 to 2023. This document presents a coexistence study. During the 41st Meeting of Permanent Consultative Committee II: Radiocommunications of the Inter American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL), one administration modified its previous Draft Inter-American Proposal, to include additional protection to the incumbent services (e.g., EESS (Active)). The same administration introduced three conditions meant to ensure protection of the incumbent services, in particular for the EESS (Active) and Radiolocation Service. Such conditions were: Administrations shall take practical measures to ensure the transmitting antennas of outdoor IMT base stations (BSs) are normally pointing below the true horizon when deployed within 10-10.5 GHz; additionally, the mechanical pointing needs to be at or below the horizon; Administrations shall use side lobe suppression techniques providing 29.5 dB of attenuation for elevation angles above 30 degrees where 0 degrees relates to the horizon and 90 degrees to the zenith, referenced to the maximum antenna gain at the boresight; The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) emitted by an IMT base station shall not exceed 32 dB W/100 MHz.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Angular-Momentum Embedded Massive MIMO: Achieving Multiplicative Spectrum-Efficiency for mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By enabling very high bandwidth for radio communications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave), which can easily be integrated with massive-multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) due to small antenna size, has been attracting growing attention as a candidate for the fifth-generation (5G) and 5G-beyond wireless communications networks. On the other hand, the communication over the orthogonal states/modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a subset of the solutions offered by massive-MIMO communications. Traditional massive-MIMO based mmWave communications did not concern the potential spectrum-efficiency-gain (SE-gain) offered by orthogonal states of OAM. However, the highly expecting maximum SE-gain for OAM and massive-MIMO communications is the product of SE-gains offered by OAM and multiplexing-MIMO. In this paper, we propose the OAM-embedded-MIMO (OEM) communication framework to obtain the multiplicative SE-gain for joint OAM and massive-MIMO based mmWave wireless communications. We design the parabolic antenna for each uniform circular array antenna to converge OAM signals. Then, we develop the mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme to obtain the transmit signal on each OAM-mode of each transmit antenna. Also, we develop the OEM-water-filling power allocation policy to achieve the maximum multiplicative SE-gain for OEM communications. The extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate our developed parabolic antenna based converging method, mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme, and OEM-water-filling policy, showing that our proposed OEM mmWave communications can significantly increase the spectrum-efficiency as compared with traditional massive-MIMO based mmWave communications.</description>

      <title>Achieving Practical OAM Based Wireless Communications With Misaligned Transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted much attention for radio vortex wireless communications due to the orthogonality among different OAM-modes. To maintain the orthogonality among different OAM modes at the receiver, the strict alignment between transmit and receive antennas is highly demanded. However, it is not practical to guarantee the transceiver alignment in wireless communications. The phase turbulence, resulting from the misaligned transceivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference among different OAM modes and therefore fail for signals detection of multiple OAM modes at the receiver. To achieve practical OAM based wireless communications, in this paper we investigate the radio vortex wireless communications with misaligned transmit and receive antennas. We propose a joint Beamforming and Pre-detection (BePre) scheme, which uses two unitary matrices to convert the channel matrix into the equivalent circulant matrix for keeping the orthogonality among OAM-modes at the receiver. Then, the OAM signals can be detected with the mode-decomposition scheme at the misaligned receiver. Extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate that our developed joint BePre scheme can efficiently detect the signals of multiple OAM-modes for the misaligned transceiver and can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Localization with Antenna Arrays in the Presence of Direction-Dependent Mutual Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing near-field sources considering practical arrays is a recent challenging topic for next generation wireless communication systems. Practical antenna array apertures with closely spaced elements exhibit direction-dependent mutual coupling (MC), which can significantly degrade the performance localization techniques. A conventional method for near-field localization in the presence of MC is the three-dimensional (3D) multiple signal classification technique, which, however, suffers from extremely high computational complexity. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) search alternatives have been presented, exhibiting increased complexity still for direction-dependent MC scenarios. In this paper, we devise a low complexity one-dimensional (1D) iterative method based on an oblique projection operator (IMOP) that estimates direction-dependent MC and the locations of multiple near-field sources. The proposed method first estimates the initial direction of arrival (DOA) and MC using the approximate wavefront model, and then, estimates the initial range of one near-field source using the exact wavefront model. Afterwards, at each iteration, the oblique projection operator is used to isolate components associated with one source from those of other sources. The DOA and range of this one source are estimated using the exact wavefront model and 1D searches. Finally, the direction-dependent MC is estimated for each pair of the estimated DOA and range. The performance of the proposed near-field localization approach is comprehensively investigated and verified using both a full-wave electromagnetic solver and synthetic simulations. It is showcased that our IMOP scheme performs almost similarly to a state-of-the-art approach but with a 42 times less computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation into Split Nonlinearity Compensation in Single and Multi-channel WDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigated the performance of split nonlinearity compensation schemes for single and multi-channel WDM systems. We show that split NLC SNR gains of more than 0.4 dB at 5540 km can be achieved compared to transmitter- or receiver-side DBP alone when signal-ASE beating limits transmission performance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analyze and compare different movement sensors: micro-chip gesture-ID, leap motion, noitom mocap, and specially developed sensor for tapping and foot motion analysis. The main goal is to evaluate the accu-racy of measurements provided by the sensors. This study presents rele-vance, for instance, in tremor/Parkinson disease analysis as well as no touch mechanisms for activation and control of devices. This scenario is especially interesting in COVID-19 scenario. Removing the need to touch a surface, the risk of contagion is reduced.</description>

      <title>Consistency Based Weakly Self-Supervised Learning for Human Activity Recognition with Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the widely available embedded sensors in smartphones and other wearable devices make it easier to obtain data of human activities, recognizing different types of human activities from sensor-based data remains a difficult research topic in ubiquitous computing. One reason for this is that most of the collected data is unlabeled. However, many current human activity recognition (HAR) systems are based on supervised methods, which heavily rely on the labels of the data. We describe a weakly self-supervised approach in this paper that consists of two stages: (1) In stage one, the model learns from the nature of human activities by projecting the data into an embedding space where similar activities are grouped together; (2) In stage two, the model is fine-tuned using similarity information in a few-shot learning fashion using the similarity information of the data. This allows downstream classification or clustering tasks to benefit from the embeddings. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and show that our approach can help the clustering algorithm achieve comparable performance in identifying and categorizing the underlying human activities as pure supervised techniques applied directly to a corresponding fully labeled data set.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Spectral Efficiency Prediction for Real-World 5G CoMP Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) systems incur substantial resource consumption due to the management of backhaul links and the coordination among various base stations (BSs). Accurate prediction of coordinated spectral efficiency (CSE) can guide the optimization of network parameters, resulting in enhanced resource utilization efficiency. However, characterizing the CSE is intractable due to the inherent complexity of the CoMP channel model and the diversity of the 5G dynamic network environment, which poses a great challenge for CSE prediction in real-world 5G CoMP systems. To address this challenge, in this letter, we propose a data-driven model-assisted approach. Initially, we leverage domain knowledge to preprocess the collected raw data, thereby creating a well-informed dataset. Within this dataset, we explicitly define the target variable and the input feature space relevant to channel statistics for CSE prediction. Subsequently, a residual-based network model is built to capture the high-dimensional non-linear mapping function from the channel statistics to the CSE. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by experimental results on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Basis Function Selection for Computationally Efficient Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basis Function (BF) expansions are a cornerstone of any engineer's toolbox for computational function approximation which shares connections with both neural networks and Gaussian processes. Even though BF expansions are an intuitive and straightforward model to use, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity in the number of BFs if the predictive variance is to be computed. We develop a method to automatically select the most important BFs for prediction in a sub-domain of the model domain. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of computing predictions while maintaining predictive accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated using two numerical examples, where reductions up to 50-75% are possible without significantly reducing the predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimizing UAV Trajectory for Emergency Response Operations under Real 3D Environments: Integrating Priority Levels and LoS Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a critical component in next-generation wireless networks, particularly for disaster recovery scenarios, due to their flexibility, mobility, and rapid deployment capabilities. This paper focuses on optimizing UAV trajectories to ensure effective communication in disaster-stricken areas using terahertz (THz) links. We address specific challenges such as energy consumption, user priority levels, and navigating complex urban environments to maintain Line of Sight (LoS) connections amidst 3D obstacles. Our contributions include the development of a detailed modeling approach using online 3D map data, the formulation of an optimal trajectory optimization problem, and the proposal of a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based method alongside an enhanced heuristic algorithm for faster convergence. Through 3D simulations, we demonstrate the trade-off between minimizing total service time and prioritizing higher-weight nodes, showing the impact of different priority weight factors on the trajectory time. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using real-world data from the West Bay area of Doha, Qatar, demonstrating their effectiveness in optimizing UAV trajectories for emergency response.</description>

      <title>Multi-periodicity dependency Transformer based on spectrum offset for radio frequency fingerprint identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has emerged as a pivotal task for reliable device authentication. Despite advancements in RFFI methods, background noise and intentional modulation features result in weak energy and subtle differences in the RFF features. These challenges diminish the capability of RFFI methods in feature representation, complicating the effective identification of device identities. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Periodicity Dependency Transformer (MPDFormer) to address these challenges. The MPDFormer employs a spectrum offset-based periodic embedding representation to augment the discrepency of intrinsic features. We delve into the intricacies of the periodicity-dependency attention mechanism, integrating both inter-period and intra-period attention mechanisms. This mechanism facilitates the extraction of both long and short-range periodicity-dependency features , accentuating the feature distinction whilst concurrently attenuating the perturbations caused by background noise and weak-periodicity features. Empirical results demonstrate MPDFormer's superiority over established baseline methods, achieving a 0.07s inference time on NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Diffusion Model of Communication in 2D Biofilm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A biofilm is a microbial city. It consists of bacteria embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that functions as a protective barrier. Quorum sensing (QS) is a method of bacterial communication, where autoinducers (AIs) propagate via diffusion through the EPS and water channels within the biofilm. This diffusion process is anisotropic due to varying densities between the EPS and water channels. This study introduces a 2D anisotropic diffusion model for molecular communication (MC) within biofilms, analyzing information propagation between a point-to-point transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) in bounded space. The channel impulse response is derived using Green's function for concentration (GFC) and is validated with particle-based simulation (PBS). The outcomes reveal similar results for both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion when the TX is centrally located due to symmetry. However, anisotropic conditions lead to greater diffusion peaks when the TX is positioned off-center. Additionally, the propagation of AIs is inversely proportional to both overall biofilm size and and diffusion coefficient values. It is hypothesized that anisotropic diffusion supports faster responses to hostile environmental changes because signals can propagate faster from the edge of the biofilm to the center.</description>

      <title>On the Parameter Selection of Phase-transmittance Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving field of digital communication systems, complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) have become a cornerstone, delivering exceptional performance in tasks like equalization, channel estimation, beamforming, and decoding. Among the myriad of CVNN architectures, the phase-transmittance radial basis function neural network (PT-RBF) stands out, especially when operating in noisy environments such as 5G MIMO systems. Despite its capabilities, achieving convergence in multi-layered, multi-input, and multi-output PT-RBFs remains a daunting challenge. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a novel Deep PT-RBF parameter initialization technique. Through rigorous simulations conforming to 3GPP TS 38 standards, our method not only outperforms conventional initialization strategies like random, $K$-means, and constellation-based methods but is also the only approach to achieve successful convergence in deep PT-RBF architectures. These findings pave the way to more robust and efficient neural network deployments in complex digital communication systems.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Corrections to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit is incorrect. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>

      <title>Bearing Fault Diagnosis using Graph Sampling and Aggregation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis technology has a wide range of practical applications in industrial production, energy and other fields. Timely and accurate detection of bearing faults plays an important role in preventing catastrophic accidents and ensuring product quality. Traditional signal analysis techniques and deep learning-based fault detection algorithms do not take into account the intricate correlation between signals, making it difficult to further improve detection accuracy. To address this problem, we introduced Graph Sampling and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) network and proposed GraphSAGE-based Bearing fault Diagnosis (GSABFD) algorithm. The original vibration signal is firstly sliced through a fixed size non-overlapping sliding window, and the sliced data is feature transformed using signal analysis methods; then correlations are constructed for the transformed vibration signal and further transformed into vertices in the graph; then the GraphSAGE network is used for training; finally the fault level of the object is calculated in the output layer of the network. The proposed algorithm is compared with five advanced algorithms in a real-world public dataset for experiments, and the results show that the GSABFD algorithm improves the AUC value by 5% compared with the next best algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</description>

      <title>BiLSTM and Attention-Based Modulation Classification of Realistic Wireless Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel and efficient quadstream BiLSTM-Attention network, abbreviated as QSLA network, for robust automatic modulation classification (AMC) of wireless signals. The proposed model exploits multiple representations of the wireless signal as inputs to the network and the feature extraction process combines convolutional and BiLSTM layers for processing the spatial and temporal features of the signal, respectively. An attention layer is used after the BiLSTM layer to emphasize the important temporal features. The experimental results on the recent and realistic RML22 dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model with an accuracy up to around 99%. The model is compared with other benchmark models in the literature in terms of classification accuracy, computational complexity, memory usage, and training time to show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>LiPCoT: Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for Self-supervised Learning of Time Series Data via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Iterative Equalization of CPM With Unitary Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous phase modulation (CPM) has extensive applications in wireless communications due to its high spectral and power efficiency. However, its nonlinear characteristics pose significant challenges for detection in frequency selective fading channels. This paper proposes an iterative receiver tailored for the detection of CPM signals over frequency selective fading channels. This design leverages the factor graph framework to integrate equalization, demodulation, and decoding functions. The equalizer employs the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm, while the unitary transformation is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the aid of a cyclic prefix (CP), thereby achieving low computational complexity while with high performance. For CPM demodulation and channel decoding, with belief propagation (BP), we design a message passing-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, and the message exchange between the demodulator, decoder and equalizer is elaborated. With proper message passing schedules, the receiver can achieve fast convergence. Simulation results show that compared with existing turbo receivers, the proposed receiver delivers significant performance enhancement with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>PeriodWave: Multi-Period Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. Although GAN-based methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage text-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all, there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields. Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to capture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires more computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by period-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the high-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental results demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks.

      <title>Alternating Deep Low-Rank Approach for Exponential Function Reconstruction and Its Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Undersampling can accelerate the signal acquisition but at the cost of bringing in artifacts. Removing these artifacts is a fundamental problem in signal processing and this task is also called signal reconstruction. Through modeling signals as the superimposed exponential functions, deep learning has achieved fast and high-fidelity signal reconstruction by training a mapping from the undersampled exponentials to the fully sampled ones. However, the mismatch, such as the sampling rate of undersampling, the organ and the contrast of imaging, between the training and target data will heavily compromise the reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose Alternating Deep Low-Rank (ADLR), which combines deep learning solvers and classic optimization solvers. Experiments on the reconstruction of synthetic and realistic biomedical magnetic resonance signals demonstrate that ADLR can effectively mitigate the mismatch issue and achieve lower reconstruction errors than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Scalable Deep Compressed Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising tool for reducing sampling costs. Current deep neural network (NN)-based CS methods face the challenges of collecting labeled measurement-ground truth (GT) data and generalizing to real applications. This paper proposes a novel $\mathbf{S}$elf-supervised s$\mathbf{C}$alable deep CS method, comprising a deep $\mathbf{L}$earning scheme called $\mathbf{SCL}$ and a family of $\mathbf{Net}$works named $\mathbf{SCNet}$, which does not require GT and can handle arbitrary sampling ratios and matrices once trained on a partial measurement set. Our SCL contains a dual-domain loss and a four-stage recovery strategy. The former encourages a cross-consistency on two measurement parts and a sampling-reconstruction cycle-consistency regarding arbitrary ratios and matrices to maximize data/information utilization. The latter can progressively leverage common signal prior in external measurements and internal characteristics of test samples and learned NNs to improve accuracy. SCNet combines both the explicit guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 1-/2-/3-D natural and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, superior performance, flexibility, and generalization ability of our method over existing self-supervised methods and its significant potential in competing against state-of-the-art supervised methods.

      <title>Can We Improve Channel Reciprocity via Loop-back Compensation for RIS-assisted Physical Layer Key Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) facilitates the extraction of unpredictable channel features for physical layer key generation (PKG), securing communications among legitimate users with symmetric keys. Previous works have demonstrated that channel reciprocity plays a crucial role in generating symmetric keys in PKG systems, whereas, in reality, reciprocity is greatly affected by hardware interference and RIS-based jamming attacks. This motivates us to propose LoCKey, a novel approach that aims to improve channel reciprocity by mitigating interferences and attacks with a loop-back compensation scheme, thus maximizing the secrecy performance of the PKG system. Specifically, our proposed LoCKey is capable of effectively compensating for the CSI non-reciprocity by the combination of transmit-back signal value and error minimization module. Firstly, we introduce the entire flowchart of our method and provide an in-depth discussion of each step. Following that, we delve into a theoretical analysis of the performance optimizations when our LoCKey is applied for CSI reciprocity enhancement. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LoCKey in improving channel reciprocity under various interferences for RIS-assisted wireless communications. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in both the rate of key generation assisted by the RIS and the consistency of the generated keys, showing great potential for the practical deployment of our LoCKey in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Deep Learning for Modulation Classification in 6G Cell-Free Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolution of 6th Generation (6G) technology, the emergence of cell-free networking presents a paradigm shift, revolutionizing user experiences within densely deployed networks where distributed access points collaborate. However, the integration of intelligent mechanisms is crucial for optimizing the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of these 6G cell-free networks. One application aiming to optimize spectrum usage is Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), a vital component for classifying and dynamically adjusting modulation schemes. This paper explores different distributed solutions for AMC in cell-free networks, addressing the training, computational complexity, and accuracy of two practical approaches. The first approach addresses scenarios where signal sharing is not feasible due to privacy concerns or fronthaul limitations. Our findings reveal that maintaining comparable accuracy is remarkably achievable, yet it comes with an increase in computational demand. The second approach considers a central model and multiple distributed models collaboratively classifying the modulation. This hybrid model leverages diversity gain through signal combining and requires synchronization and signal sharing. The hybrid model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a 2.5% improvement in accuracy with equivalent total computational load. Notably, the hybrid model distributes the computational load across multiple devices, resulting in a lower individual computational load.</description>

      <title>Clinical translation of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection in scalp electroencephalography: systematic review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms for seizure detection have shown considerable diagnostic potential, with recent reported accuracies reaching 100%. Yet, only few published algorithms have fully addressed the requirements for successful clinical translation. This is, for example, because the properties of training data may limit the generalisability of algorithms, algorithm performance may vary depending on which electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition hardware was used, or run-time processing costs may be prohibitive to real-time clinical use cases. To address these issues in a critical manner, we systematically review machine learning algorithms for seizure detection with a focus on clinical translatability, assessed by criteria including generalisability, run-time costs, explainability, and clinically-relevant performance metrics. For non-specialists, the domain-specific knowledge necessary to contextualise model development and evaluation is provided. It is our hope that such critical evaluation of machine learning algorithms with respect to their potential real-world effectiveness can help accelerate clinical translation and identify gaps in the current seizure detection literature.</description>

      <title>Using Explainable AI for EEG-based Reduced Montage Neonatal Seizure Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neonatal period is the most vulnerable time for the development of seizures. Seizures in the immature brain lead to detrimental consequences, therefore require early diagnosis. The gold-standard for neonatal seizure detection currently relies on continuous video-EEG monitoring; which involves recording multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) alongside real-time video monitoring within a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, video-EEG monitoring technology requires clinical expertise and is often limited to technologically advanced and resourceful settings. Cost-effective new techniques could help the medical fraternity make an accurate diagnosis and advocate treatment without delay. In this work, a novel explainable deep learning model to automate the neonatal seizure detection process with a reduced EEG montage is proposed, which employs convolutional nets, graph attention layers, and fully connected layers. Beyond its ability to detect seizures in real-time with a reduced montage, this model offers the unique advantage of real-time interpretability. By evaluating the performance on the Zenodo dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the presented model achieves an absolute improvement of 8.31% and 42.86% in area under curve (AUC) and recall, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The ubiquity of multiscale interactions in complex systems is well-recognized, with development and heredity serving as a prime example of how processes at different temporal scales influence one another. This work introduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic interplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with feedback between each scale. We propose a Bayesian learning framework to estimate unknown states by learning the unknown process noise covariances within this multiscale model. We develop a Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling (PGAS) algorithm for inference and demonstrate through simulations the efficacy of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are an increasingly integral part of modern factory and warehouse operations. Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.
