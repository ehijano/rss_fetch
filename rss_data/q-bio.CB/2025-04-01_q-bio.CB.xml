      <title>Simulating cell populations with explicit cell cycle length -- implications to cell cycle dependent tumour therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.</description>

      <title>Soil-mimicking microfluidic devices reveal restricted flagellar motility of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens under microconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.</description>

      <title>Intercellular contact is sufficient to drive Fibroblast to Myofibroblast transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibroblast cells play a key role in maintaining the extracellular matrix. During wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix proteins like collagen to facilitate tissue repair. Under normal conditions, myofibroblasts undergo programmed cell death after healing to prevent excessive scar formation. However, in diseases like fibrosis, the myofibroblasts remain active even after the wound is closed, resulting in excessive collagen buildup and a stiff, fibrotic matrix. The reasons for the persistence of myofibroblasts in fibrosis are not well understood. Here we show the existence of a mechanism where direct physical contact between a fibroblast and a myofibroblast is sufficient for fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts. We show that fibroblast-myofibroblast transition can occur even in the absence of known biochemical cues such as growth factor activation or mechanical cues from a stiff, fibrotic matrix. Further, we show that contact-based fibroblast-myofibroblast activation can be blocked by G{\alpha}q/11/14 inhibitor FR9003591, which inhibits the formation of myofibroblasts. These findings offer new insights into the persistence of fibrosis despite therapeutic interventions and suggest a potential strategy to target fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in fibrosis.</description>
