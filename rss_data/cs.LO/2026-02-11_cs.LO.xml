      <title>On A Parameterized Theory of Dynamic Logic for Operationally-based Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying dynamic logics to program verifications is a challenge, because their axiomatic rules for regular expressions can be difficult to be adapted to different program models. We present a novel dynamic logic, called DLp, which supports reasoning based on programs' operational semantics. For those programs whose transitional behaviours are their standard or natural semantics, DLp makes their verifications easier since one can directly apply the program transitions for reasoning, without the need of re-designing and validating new rules as in most other dynamic logics. DLp is parametric. It provides a model-independent framework consisting of a relatively small set of inference rules, which depends on a given set of trustworthy rules for the operational semantics. These features of DLp let multiple models easily compared in its framework and makes it compatible with existing dynamic-logic theories. DLp supports cyclic reasoning, providing an incremental derivation process for recursive programs, making it more convenient to reason about without prior program transformations. We analyze and prove the soundness and completeness of DLp under certain conditions. Several case studies illustrate the features of DLp and fully demonstrate its potential usage.</description>

      <title>Bounded Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the Curry--Howard isomorphism, the syntactic structure of programs can be modeled using birelational Kripke structures equipped with intuitionistic and modal relations. Intuitionistic relations capture scoping through persistence, reflecting the availability of resources from outer scopes, while modal relations model resource isolation introduced for various purposes.
  Traditional modal languages, however, describe only modal transitions and thus provide limited support for expressing fine-grained control over resource availability. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce \emph{Bounded Modal Logic (\textbf{BML})}, an experimental extension of constructive modal logic whose language explicitly accounts for both intuitionistic and modal transitions.
  We present a natural-deduction proof system and a Kripke semantics for \textbf{BML}, together with a Curry--Howard interpretation via a corresponding typed lambda-calculus. We establish metatheoretic properties of the calculus, showing that \textbf{BML} forms a well-disciplined logical system. This provides theoretical support for our proposed perspective on fine-grained resource control in programming languages.</description>

      <title>A Theory for Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new bounded arithmetic theory, denoted $APX_1$, designed to formalize a broad class of probabilistic arguments commonly used in theoretical computer science. Under plausible assumptions, $APX_1$ is strictly weaker than previously proposed frameworks, such as the theory $APC_1$ introduced in the seminal work of Jerabek (2007). From a computational standpoint, $APX_1$ is closely tied to approximate counting and to the central question in derandomization, the prBPP versus prP problem, whereas $APC_1$ is linked to the dual weak pigeonhole principle and to the existence of Boolean functions with exponential circuit complexity.
  A key motivation for introducing $APX_1$ is that its weaker axioms expose finer proof-theoretic structure, making it a natural setting for several lines of research, including unprovability of complexity conjectures and reverse mathematics of randomized lower bounds. In particular, the framework we develop for $APX_1$ enables the formulation of precise questions concerning the provability of prBPP=prP in deterministic feasible mathematics. Since the (un)provability of P versus NP in bounded arithmetic has long served as a central theme in the field, we expect this line of investigation to be of particular interest.
  Our technical contributions include developing a comprehensive foundation for probabilistic reasoning from weaker axioms, formalizing non-trivial results from theoretical computer science in $APX_1$, and establishing a tailored witnessing theorem for its provably total TFNP problems. As a byproduct of our analysis of the minimal proof-theoretic strength required to formalize statements arising in theoretical computer science, we resolve an open problem regarding the provability of $AC^0$ lower bounds in $PV_1$, which was considered in earlier works by Razborov (1995), Krajicek (1995), and Muller and Pich (2020).</description>

      <title>FLINGO -- Instilling ASP Expressiveness into Linear Integer Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a hybrid paradigm that enriches Answer Set Programming (ASP) with numerical constraint processing, something required in many real-world applications. The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.</description>

      <title>Simpler Presentations for Many Fragments of Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equational reasoning is central to quantum circuit optimisation and verification: one replaces subcircuits by provably equivalent ones using a fixed set of rewrite rules viewed as equations. We study such reasoning through finite equational theories, presenting restricted quantum gate fragments as symmetric monoidal categories (PROPs), where wire permutations are treated as structural and separated cleanly from fragment-specific gate axioms. For six widely used near-Clifford fragments: qubit Clifford, real Clifford, Clifford+T (up to two qubits), Clifford+CS (up to three qubits) and CNOT-dihedral, we transfer the completeness results of prior work into our PROP framework. Beyond completeness, we address minimality (axiom independence). Using uniform separating interpretations into simple semantic targets, we prove minimality for several fragments (including all arities for qubit Clifford, real Clifford, and CNOT-dihedral), and bounded minimality for the remaining cases. Overall, our presentations significantly reduce rule counts compared to prior work and provide a reusable categorical framework for constructing complete and often minimal rewrite systems for quantum circuit fragments.</description>

      <title>Graded Monads in the Semantics of Nominal Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nominal automata models serve as a formalism for data languages, and in fact often relate closely to classical register models. The paradigm of name allocation in nominal automata helps alleviate the pervasive computational hardness of register models in a tradeoff between expressiveness and computational tractability. For instance, regular nondeterministic nominal automata (RNNAs) correspond, under their local freshness semantics, to a form of lossy register automata. Unlike the full register automaton model, RNNAs allow for inclusion checking in elementary complexity. The semantic framework of graded monads provides a unified algebraic treatment of spectra of behavioural equivalences in the setting of universal coalgebra. In the present work, we extend the associated notion of graded algebraic theory to the nominal setting, and develop a nominal version of the notion of graded behavioural equivalence game. In the arising framework of graded nominal algebra, we conduct an extended case study, giving an algebraic theory capturing the local freshness semantics of RNNAs and the related nominal transition systems. Moreover, we instantiate the general behavioural equivalence game to this setting.</description>

      <title>A Complete Propositional Dynamic Logic for Regular Expressions with Lookahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider (logical) reasoning for regular expressions with lookahead (REwLA). In this paper, we give an axiomatic characterization for both the (match-)language equivalence and the largest substitution-closed equivalence that is sound for the (match-)language equivalence. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of propositional dynamic logic (PDL) on finite linear orders, extended with two operators: the restriction to the identity relation and the restriction to its complement. Our main contribution is a sound and complete Hilbert-style finite axiomatization for the logic, which captures the equivalences of REwLA. Using the extended operators, the completeness is established via a reduction into an identity-free variant of PDL on finite strict linear orders. Moreover, the extended PDL has the same computational complexity as REwLA.</description>

      <title>Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt &amp; Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23787v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the class of Kalm\'ar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder, and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>

      <title>Capturing properties of planar diagrams in Lean proof assistant software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated proof assistants are a technology pre-empting mistakes in mathematics. In our practice we have seen that reasoning about planar diagrams is difficult to both humans and computers. One example that has led to wrong statements in publications is that an orientation-preserving mapping is not always defined by how it acts on triples of elements. In this paper we formalise orientation-preserving mappings in proof assistant software Lean and report on our take-aways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniform interpolation is a strengthening of interpolation that holds for certain propositional logics. The starting point of this chapter is a theorem of A. Pitts, which shows that uniform interpolation holds for intuitionistic propositional logic. We outline how this theorem may be proved semantically via the definability of bisimulation quantifiers, and how it generalizes to an open mapping theorem between Esakia spaces. We also discuss connections between uniform interpolation and research in categorical logic, algebra, and model theory.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Logic Synthesis: Spectral Coefficient Selection via Sinkhorn-Constrained Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning precise Boolean logic via gradient descent remains challenging: neural networks typically converge to "fuzzy" approximations that degrade under quantization. We introduce Hierarchical Spectral Composition, a differentiable architecture that selects spectral coefficients from a frozen Boolean Fourier basis and composes them via Sinkhorn-constrained routing with column-sign modulation. Our approach draws on recent insights from Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), which demonstrated that projecting routing matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope preserves identity mappings and stabilizes large-scale training. We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.
  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity). (3) For n=4 (10 four-variable operations over 16-dim basis), spectral synthesis -- combining exact Walsh-Hadamard coefficients, ternary quantization, and MCMC refinement with parallel tempering -- achieves 100% accuracy on all operations. This progression establishes (a) that ternary polynomial threshold representations exist for all tested functions, and (b) that finding them requires methods beyond pure gradient descent as dimensionality grows. All operations enable single-cycle combinational logic inference at 10,959 MOps/s on GPU, demonstrating viability for hardware-efficient neuro-symbolic logic synthesis.</description>
