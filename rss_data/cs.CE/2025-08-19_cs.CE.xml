      <title>Persistence is All You Need -- A Topological Lens on Microstructural Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructure critically governs the properties of materials used in energy and chemical engineering technologies, from catalysts and filters to thermal insulators and sensors. Therefore, accurate design is based on quantitative descriptors of microstructural features. Here we show that eight key descriptors can be extracted by a single workflow that fuses computational topology with assembly-learning-based regression. First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials.</description>

      <title>Porous Convection in the Discrete Exterior Calculus with Geometric Multigrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete exterior calculus (DEC) defines a family of discretized differential operators which preserve certain desirable properties from the exterior calculus. We formulate and solve the porous convection equations in the DEC via the Decapodes.jl embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for multiphysics problems discretized via CombinatorialSpaces.jl. CombinatorialSpaces.jl is an open-source Julia library which implements the DEC over simplicial complexes, and now offers a geometric multigrid solver over maps between subdivided simplicial complexes. We demonstrate numerical results of multigrid solvers for the Poisson problem and porous convection problem, both as a standalone solver and as a preconditioner for open-source Julia iterative methods libraries.</description>

      <title>Ensured Energy: A simulation game to elicit preferences around Swiss energy transition pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming specifies national objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In support of Switzerland's energy and climate strategy for 2050, researchers investigate scenarios for the transition of energy systems towards a higher share of renewables, assessing their social, environmental and economic impact. Their results guide stakeholders and policy makers in designing resilient and sustainable systems. Political scientists use surveys to quantify public acceptance of energy policy, but the complexity and long time horizon of the subject creates difficulties, both for researchers in posing contextually relevant questions, and for respondents in assimilating enough information to give meaningful answers. A population survey was therefore augmented with an online serious game in which players experience an accurate simulation of current and future energy provision and manage transition towards a sustainable future. This interactive environment allows better informed and engaged decisions, and provides richer information on public opinion. In this paper we motivate and describe the design of the game and report initial findings on player characteristics and engagement. We show that a serious game can successfully attract participants from diverse societal groups and highlight the challenge of balancing complexity and entertainment.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion models for inverse design of inflatable structures with programmable deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large, nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while accommodating complex constraints.</description>

      <title>BConformeR: A Conformer Based on Mutual Sampling for Unified Prediction of Continuous and Discontinuous Antibody Binding Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on conformational epitopes.</description>

      <title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</description>

      <title>Shapley Values: Paired-Sampling Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Originally introduced in cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become a very popular tool to explain machine learning predictions. Based on Shapley's fairness axioms, every input (feature component) gets a credit how it contributes to an output (prediction). These credits are then used to explain the prediction. The only limitation in computing the Shapley values (credits) for many different predictions is of computational nature. There are two popular sampling approximations, sampling KernelSHAP and sampling PermutationSHAP. Our first novel contributions are asymptotic normality results for these sampling approximations. Next, we show that the paired-sampling approaches provide exact results in case of interactions being of maximal order two. Furthermore, the paired-sampling PermutationSHAP possesses the additive recovery property, whereas its kernel counterpart does not.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis in Frequency Domain: A Survey of Open Challenges, Opportunities and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-domain analysis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, offering unique advantages over traditional time-domain approaches while introducing new theoretical and practical challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of spectral methods from classical Fourier analysis to modern neural operators, systematically summarizing three open challenges in current research: (1) causal structure preservation during spectral transformations, (2) uncertainty quantification in learned frequency representations, and (3) topology-aware analysis for non-Euclidean data structures. Through rigorous reviewing of over 100 studies, we develop a unified taxonomy that bridges conventional spectral techniques with cutting-edge machine learning approaches, while establishing standardized benchmarks for performance evaluation. Our work identifies key knowledge gaps in the field, particularly in geometric deep learning and quantum-enhanced spectral analysis. The survey offers practitioners a systematic framework for method selection and implementation, while charting promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</description>

      <title>Quantformer: from attention to profit with a quantitative transformer trading strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional quantitative trading practice, navigating the complicated and dynamic financial market presents a persistent challenge. Fully capturing various market variables, including long-term information, as well as essential signals that may lead to profit remains a difficult task for learning algorithms. In order to tackle this challenge, this paper introduces quantformer, an enhanced neural network architecture based on transformer, to build investment factors. By transfer learning from sentiment analysis, quantformer not only exploits its original inherent advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and modeling complex data relationships, but is also able to solve tasks with numerical inputs and accurately forecast future returns over a given period. This work collects more than 5,000,000 rolling data of 4,601 stocks in the Chinese capital market from 2010 to 2023. The results of this study demonstrate the model's superior performance in predicting stock trends compared with other 100-factor-based quantitative strategies. Notably, the model's innovative use of transformer-like model to establish factors, in conjunction with market sentiment information, has been shown to enhance the accuracy of trading signals significantly, thereby offering promising implications for the future of quantitative trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Regress, Don't Guess -- A Regression-like Loss on Number Tokens for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they lack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks involving quantitative reasoning, especially arithmetic. One fundamental limitation is the nature of the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which assumes a nominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without runtime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical datasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related tasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match the performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level. Finally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved performance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We hope to inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives and distribute NTL as a minimalistic and lightweight PyPI package $ntloss$: https://github.com/ai4sd/number-token-loss. Development code for full paper reproduction is available separately.</description>

      <title>On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method in anomaly detection, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest F1-score in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, with an F1-score scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 \textmu J during inference.
