      <title>Rogue wave patterns associated with Adler Moser polynomials in the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on new rogue waves patterns in the nolocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. Utilizing the aysmptotic analysis approach, we show that when multiple free parameters get considerably large, its rogue wave patterns can be approximately predicted by the root structures of the Adler Moser polynomials. Adler Moser polynomials, as a generalization of Yablonskii Vorob'ev polynomial hierarchies have more diverse root structures, such as heart-shaped. We divide the (x,t) plane into three regions and through the combination of asymptotic results in different regions, novel rogue wave patterns can be obtained. We also compare the predicted outcomes with true solutions both graphically and numerically to demonstrates good agreement between them.</description>

      <title>Pulse-train propagation in nonlinear Kerr media governed by higher-order dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover three novel classes of pulse-train waveforms in an optical Kerr nonlinear medium
  possessing all orders of dispersion up to the fourth order. We show that both single- and double humped pulse-trains can be formed in the nonlinear medium. A distinguishing property is that these
  structures have different amplitudes, widths and wavenumbers but equal velocity which depends on
  the three dispersion parameters. More importantly, we find that the relation between the amplitude
  and duration of all the newly obtained pulse-trains is determined by the sign of a joint parameter
  solely. The results show that those optical waves are general, in the sense that no specified conditions
  on the material parameters are assumed. Considering the long-wave limit, the derived pulse-trains
  degenerate to soliton pulses of the quartic and dipole kinds.</description>

      <title>The effect of self-induced Marangoni flow on polar-nematic waves in active-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of propagating large-scale density waves of mixed polar-nematic symmetry in a colony of self-propelled agents that are bound to move along the planar surface of a thin viscous film. The agents act as an insoluble surfactant, i.e. the surface tension of the liquid depends on their density. Therefore, density gradients generate a Marangoni flow. We demonstrate that for active matter in the form of self-propelled surfactants with local (nematic) aligning interactions such a Marangoni flow nontrivially influences the propagation of the density waves. Upon gradually increasing the Marangoni parameter, which characterises the relative strength of the Marangoni flow as compared to the self-propulsion speed, the density waves broaden while their speed may either increase or decrease depending on wavelength and overall mean density. A further increase of the Marangoni parameter eventually results in the disappearance of the density waves. This may occur either discontinuously at finite wave amplitude via a saddle-node bifurcation or continuously with vanishing wave amplitude at a wave bifurcation, i.e. a finite-wavelength Hopf bifurcation.</description>
