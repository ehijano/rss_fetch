      <title>A physical interpretation of Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new interpretation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism is proposed. The primitive world before the mass generation of fermions occurs is regarded as a relativistic virtual many-body state of massless fermion and antifermion taking both timelike and spacelike paths. In order for the many-body state to have a physical meaning independently of observers, virtual massless fermions and antifermions there should move along a common direction of time, even if they are observed from any inertial fame. As a lowest-energy-state satisfying this condition, the physical vacuum with broken symmetry is derived. Since symmetry breaking arises from the kinematical reason, whatever effective interaction acts on massless fermion, it generates fermion's mass, because it escapes from the role of causing symmetry breaking. In the physical vacuum, pairs of fermion and antifermion behaves as quasi bosons due to the overlap of their wave function. Due to Bose statistics, the physical vacuum shows a kind of rigidity in transverse perturbations, and it explains the origin of the vacuum condensate in the BEH potential. As a dynamical part of the above effective interaction, a Higgs-like excitation appears. This interpretation sheds a new light on the fundamental problems inherent in the BEH mechanism.</description>
