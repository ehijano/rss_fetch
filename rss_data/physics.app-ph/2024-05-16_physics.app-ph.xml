      <title>CMOS-compatible Strain Engineering for High-Performance Monolayer Semiconductor Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering has played a key role in modern silicon electronics, having been introduced as a mobility booster in the 1990s and commercialized in the early 2000s. Achieving similar advances with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors in a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) compatible manner would radically improve the industrial viability of 2D transistors. Here, we show silicon nitride capping layers can impart strain to monolayer MoS2 transistors on conventional silicon substrates, enhancing their electrical performance with a low thermal budget (350 {\deg}C), CMOS-compatible approach. Strained back-gated and dual-gated MoS2 transistors demonstrate median increases up to 60% and 45% in on-state current, respectively. The greatest improvements are found when both transistor channels and contacts are reduced to ~200 nm, reaching saturation currents of 488 uA/um, higher than any previous reports at such short contact pitch. Simulations reveal that most benefits arise from tensile strain lowering the contact Schottky barriers, and that further reducing device dimensions (including contacts) will continue to offer increased strain and performance improvements.</description>

      <title>One-step Pulsed Laser Deposition of Metal oxynitride/Carbon Composites for Supercapacitor Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced material composite of nanocarbons and metal-based materials provides a synergistic effect to obtain excellent electrochemical charge-storage performance and other properties. Herein, 3D porous carbon-metal oxynitride nanocomposites with tunable carbon/metal and oxygen/nitrogen ratio are synthesized uniquely by simultaneous ablation from two different targets by single-step pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. Co ablation of titanium and vanadium nitride targets together with graphite allowed us to synthesize carbon-metal oxynitride porous nanocomposite and exploit them as a binder-free thin film supercapacitor electrode in aqueous electrolyte. We show that the elemental composition ratio and hence the structural properties can be tuned by selecting target configuration and by manipulating the ablation position. We investigate how this tuning capability impacts their charge-storage performances. We anticipate the utilization of as-synthesized various composites in a single PLD production run as next-generation active materials for flexible energy storage and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Amplification in the Frozen Mode Regime Enabled by a Nonlinear Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stationary inflection point (SIP) is a spectral singularity of the Bloch dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ of a periodic structure where the first and the second derivatives of $\omega$ with respect to $k$ vanish. An SIP is associated with a third order exceptional point degeneracy in the spectrum of the unit-cell transfer matrix, where there is a collapse of one propagating and two evanescent Bloch modes. At the SIP frequency, the incident wave can be efficiently converted into the frozen mode with greatly enhanced amplitude and vanishing group velocity. This can be very attractive for applications, including light amplification. Due to its non-resonant nature, the frozen mode regime (FMR) has fundamental advantages over common cavity resonances. Here, we propose a novel scheme for FMR-based unidirectional amplifiers by leveraging a tailored amplification/attenuation mechanism and a single nonlinear defect. The defect breaks the directional symmetry of the periodic structure and enables nonlinearity-related unidirectional amplification/ attenuation in the vicinity of the SIP frequency. We demonstrate the robustness of the amplification mechanism to local impurities and parasitic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Compact quantum algorithms that can potentially maintain quantum advantage for solving time-dependent differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs governing fluid flow problems. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms lead to low-depth quantum circuits that protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities that are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) ideal state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called $\textit{QFlowS}$; (b) experiments on a real quantum device (IBM Cairo); and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices.</description>

      <title>Electrically switchable $2^N$-channel wave-front control with N cascaded polarization-dependent metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To increase the operating channels of polarization-dependent metasurfaces, we proposed a structure of $N$ cascaded dual-channel metasurfaces to achieve $2^N$ electrically switchable functional channels without intrinsic noise or cross-talk. As proof of principles, we have implemented a 3-layer setup to achieve 8 switchable channels. In success, we have demonstrated two typical applications of vortex beam generation with switchable topological charge of l=-3 ~ +4 or l=-1~ -8, and beam steering with the deflecting direction switchable in an 8*1 line or a 4*2 grid. We believe that our proposal would provide a practical way to extend the functionality of polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces, which are potential for the applications of LiDAR, glasses-free 3D display, OAM (de)multiplexing, and varifocal meta-lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are of a great interest due to their extremely low waveguides losses. The number of Si3N4 integrated photonics platform applications is constantly growing including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) devices, hybrid neuromorphic and quantum computing. Their heterogeneous integration with a III-V platform leads to a new advanced large scale PICs with thousands of elements. Here, we review key trends in Si3N4 integrated circuits technology and fill an information gap in the field of state-of-the-art photonic devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectra. A comprehensive overview of Si3N4 integrared circtuis microfabrication process details (deposition, lithography, etching, etc.) is introduced. Finally, we point out the limits and challenges of silicon nitride photonics performance in an ultrawide range providing routes and prospects for their future scaling and optimization.</description>

      <title>On-chip integrated metasystem for spin-dependent multi-channel colour holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip integrated metasurface driven by in-plane guided waves is of great interests in various light field manipulation applications such as colorful augmented reality and holographic display. However, it remains a challenge to design colorful multichannel holography by a single on-chip metasurface. Here we present metasurfaces integrated on top of guided-wave photonic slab that achieves multi-channel colorful holographic light display. An end-to-end scheme is used to inverse design the metasurface for projecting off-chip preset multiple patterns. Particular examples are presented for customized patterns that were encoded into the metasurface with a single-cell meta-atom, working simultaneously at RGB color channels and for several different diffractive distance, with polarization dependence. Holographic images are generated at 18 independent channels with such a single-cell metasurface. The proposed design scheme is easy to implement and the resulting device is viable to fabrication, promising a plenty of applications in nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>In-situ optical vector analysis based on integrated lithium niobate single-sideband modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical vector analysis (OVA) is an enabling technology for comprehensively characterizing both amplitude and phase responses of optical devices or systems. Conventional OVA technologies are mostly based on discrete optoelectronic components, leading to unsatisfactory system sizes, complexity, and stability. They also encounter challenges in revealing the on-chip characteristics of integrated photonic devices, which are often overwhelmed by the substantial coupling loss and extra spectral response at chip facets. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized OVA system for integrated photonics devices based on broadband single sideband (SSB) modulators on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. The OVA could provide a direct probe of both amplitude and phase responses of photonic devices with kHz-level resolution and tens of terahertz measurement bandwidth. We perform in-situ characterizations of single and coupled microring resonators fabricated on the same chip as the OVA, unfolding their intrinsic loss and coupling states unambiguously. Furthermore, we achieve the direct measurement of collective phase dynamics and density of states of the Bloch modes in a synthetic frequency crystal, by in-situ OVA of a dynamically modulated microring resonator. Our in-situ OVA system provides a compact, high-precision, and broadband solution for characterizing future integrated photonic devices and circuits, with potential applications ranging from optical communications, biosensing, neuromorphic computing, to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Beyond memory-effect matrix-based imaging in scattering media by acousto-optic gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging inside scattering media at optical resolution is a longstanding challenge affecting multiple fields, from bio-medicine to astronomy. In recent years, several groundbreaking techniques for imaging inside scattering media, in particular scattering-matrix based approaches, have shown great promise, but usually suffer from a restricted field of view (FOV) due to their reliance on the optical 'memory-effect'. Here, we demonstrate that by combining acousto-optic spatial-gating with state-of-the-art matrix-based imaging techniques, diffraction-limited imaging beyond the optical memory-effect can be achieved in a robust fashion. Specifically, we show that this can be achieved by computational processing of scattered light fields captured under scanned acousto-optic modulation. The approach can be directly utilized whenever the ultrasound focus size is of the order of the memory-effect range, independently of the scattering angle.</description>

      <title>Relativistic EELS scattering cross-sections for microanalysis based on Dirac solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rich information of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) comes from the complex inelastic scattering process whereby fast electrons transfer energy and momentum to atoms, exciting bound electrons from their ground states to higher unoccupied states. To quantify EELS, the common practice is to compare the cross-sections integrated within an energy window or fit the observed spectrum with theoretical differential cross-sections calculated from a generalized oscillator strength (GOS) database with experimental parameters. The previous Hartree-Fock-based and DFT-based GOS are calculated from Schr\"odinger's solution of atomic orbitals, which does not include the full relativistic effects. Here, we attempt to go beyond the limitations of the Schr\"odinger solution in the GOS tabulation by including the full relativistic effects using the Dirac equation within the local density approximation, which is particularly important for core-shell electrons of heavy elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. This has been done for all elements in the periodic table (up to Z = 118) for all possible excitation edges using modern computing capabilities and parallelization algorithms. The relativistic effects of fast incoming electrons were included to calculate cross-sections that are specific to the acceleration voltage. We make these tabulated GOS available under an open-source license to the benefit of both academic users as well as allowing integration into commercial solutions.</description>

      <title>Electrically Injected mid-infrared GeSn laser on Si operating at 140 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its true direct bandgap and tunable bandgap energies,GeSn alloys are increasingly attractive as gain media for mid-IR lasers that can be monolithically integrated on Si. Demonstrations of optically pumped GeSn laser at room under pulsed condition and at cryogenic temperature under continuous-wave excitation show great promise of GeSn lasers to be efficient electrically injected light sources on Si. Here we report electrically injected GeSn lasers using Fabry-Perot cavity with 20, 40, and 80 micron ridge widths. A maximum operating temperature of 140 K with lasing threshold of 0.756 kA/cm2 at 77 K and emitting wavelength of 2722 nm at 140 K was obtained. The lower threshold current density compared to previous works was achieved by reducing optical loss and improving the optical confinement. The peak power was measured as 2.2 mW/facet at 77 K.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Janus MoSSe surface polarization in designing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) have attracted much attention because of their outstanding electronic and optical properties. The additional out-of-plane dipole in JTMDs can form n- and p-like Ohmic contacts, and this may be used in device applications such as pin diodes and photovoltaic cells. In this study, we exploit this property to design n- and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). First, we use density-functional theory calculations to study the inherent dipole field strength in the trilayer JTMD MoSSe. The intrinsic dipole of MoSSe causes band bending at both the metal/MoSSe and MoSSe/metal interfaces, resulting in electron and hole accumulation to form n- and p-type Ohmic contact regions. We incorporate this property into a 2D finite-element-based Poisson-drift-diffusion solver to perform simulations, on the basis of which we design complementary MOSFETs. Our results demonstrate that JTMDs can be used to make n- and p-MOSFETs in the same layer without the need for any extra doping.</description>

      <title>Investigation of nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides for on-chip evanescent wave sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising photonic platform for on-chip optical sensing because both nonlinear and linear components can be fabricated within one integrated device. To date, waveguided sample interactions for thin-film lithium niobate are not well explored. Compared to other integrated platforms, lithium niobate's high refractive index, birefringence, and angled sidewalls present unique design challenges for evanescent wave sensing. Here, we compare the performance of the quasi-transverse-electric (TE) and the quasi-transverse-magnetic (TM) mode for sensing on a thin-film lithium niobate rib waveguide with a 5 mM dye-doped polymer cladding pumped at 406 nm. We determine that both modes have propagation losses dominated by scatter, and that the absorption due to the sample only accounts for 3% of the measured losses for both modes. The TM mode has better overlap with the sample than the TE mode, but the TM mode also has a stronger propagation loss due to sidewall and sample induced scattering (32.5 $\pm$ 0.3 dB/cm) compared to the TE mode (23.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dB/cm). The TE mode is, therefore, more appropriate for sensing. Our findings have important implications for on-chip lithium niobate-based sensor designs.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>

Abstract: Indium selenide, In2Se3, has recently attracted growing interest due to its novel properties, including room temperature ferroelectricity, outstanding photoresponsivity, and exotic in-plane ferroelectricity, which open up new regimes for next generation electronics. In2Se3 also provides the important advantage of tuning the electrical properties of ultra-thin layers with an external electrical and magnetic field, making it a potential platform to study novel two-dimensional physics. Yet, In2Se3 has many different polymorphs, and it has been challenging to synthesize single-phase material, especially using scalable growth methods, as needed for technological applications. In this paper, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure of twin-free single-phase ultra-thin layers of beta-In2Se3, prepared by a unique molecular beam epitaxy approach. We emphasize features of the In2Se3 layer and In2Se3/InP interface which provide evidence for understanding the growth mechanism of the single-phase In2Se3. This novel approach for forming high-quality twin-free single phase two-dimensional crystals on InP substrates is likely to be applicable to other technologically important substrates.</description>
