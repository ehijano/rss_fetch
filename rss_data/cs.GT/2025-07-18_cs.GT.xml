      <title>Competition Erases Simplicity: Tight Regret Bounds for Uniform Pricing with Multiple Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study repeated \textsf{Uniform Pricing} mechanisms with multiple buyers. In each round, the platform sets a uniform price for all buyers; a transaction occurs if at least one buyer bids at or above this price. Prior work demonstrates that structural assumptions on bid distributions -- such as regularity or monotone hazard rate (MHR) property -- enable significant improvements in pricing query complexity (from $\Theta\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ to $\widetilde\Theta\left(\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$\footnote{The $\widetilde \Theta$ notation omits polylogarithmic factors.}) and regret bounds (from $\Theta\left(T^{2/3}\right)$ to $\widetilde\Theta\left(T^{1/2}\right)$) for single-buyer settings. Strikingly, we demonstrate that these improvements vanish with multiple buyers: both general and structured distributions (including regular/MHR) share identical asymptotic performance, achieving pricing query complexity of $\widetilde\Theta\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ and regret of $\widetilde\Theta\left(T^{2/3}\right)$.
  This result reveals a dichotomy between single-agent and multi-agent environments. While the special structure of distributions simplifies learning for a single buyer, competition among multiple buyers erases these benefits, forcing platforms to adopt universally robust pricing strategies. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom from single-buyer theory and underscore the necessity of revisiting mechanism design principles in more competitive settings.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound for Online MMS Assignment of Indivisible Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online assignment of indivisible chores under \MMS\ criteria. The previous work proves that any deterministic online algorithm for chore division has a competitive ratio of at least 2. In this work, we improve this bound by showing that no deterministic online algorithm can obtain a competitive ratio better than $n$ for $n$ agents.</description>

      <title>On multiagent online problems with predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties and benchmark it.</description>

      <title>MR-LDM -- The Merge-Reactive Longitudinal Decision Model: Game Theoretic Human Decision Modeling for Interactive Sim Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior, i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development.</description>
