      <title>Angled Aortic Cannulation Reduces Cerebral Embolic Transport and Adverse Wall Loading During Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Patient-Specific Hemodynamic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embolic stroke during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is strongly influenced by cannula induced flow disturbances that govern emboli transport and aortic wall loading. This study quantifies how aortic cannula orientation affects embolic distribution and atherosclerotic plaque disruption risk across patient specific, age-dependent aortic anatomies under clinical CPB conditions. A validated computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle tracking (CFD-LPT) framework was applied to four patient-specific aortic models representing pediatric, adolescent, adult, and geriatric anatomies. Two clinically relevant cannula orientations: perpendicular (90 deg) and angled (30 deg), were evaluated under varying blood viscosities (1.5 to 3.5 cP) and embolus sizes (0.5 to 2.5 mm). Aortic branch exit percentage, wall pressure, and wall shear stress (WSS) were quantified. The 30 deg angled cannula reduced embolic transport into the aortic branches by 18 to 50 percent compared with perpendicular cannulation, with the largest reduction observed in the geriatric model. Perpendicular cannulation produced concentrated jet impingement, resulting in significantly elevated posterior wall pressure (24 percent) and up to an 8 fold increase in local WSS. The pediatric anatomy exhibited the highest sensitivity, where decreasing viscosity and increasing embolus size increased branch exit by 8.4 percent and 25 to 44 percent, respectively, consistent with higher particle Stokes numbers and inertial decoupling from the core flow. Angled cannulation redistributes jet momentum along the aortic curvature, weakens jet impingement, reduces localized pressure and wall stress, and limits embolic delivery towards the cerebral circulation. These findings provide mechanistic, patient-specific evidence supporting angled cannula orientation to reduce CPB complications.</description>

      <title>Percentile-based probabilistic optimization for systematic and random uncertainties in radiation therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric uncertainty can degrade treatment quality in radiation therapy. While margins and robust optimization mitigate these effects, they provide only implicit control over clinical goal fulfillment probability. We therefore develop a probabilistic planning framework using a percentile-based optimization function that targets a specified probability of clinical goal fulfillment.
  Systematic and random uncertainties were explicitly modeled over full treatment courses. A scenario dose approximation method based on interpolation between a fixed set of doses was used, enabling efficient simulation of treatment courses during optimization. The framework was evaluated on a prostate case treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and a brain case treated with pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. Plans were compared to conventional margin-based and worst-case robust optimization using probabilistic evaluation.
  For the prostate case, probabilistic optimization improved organ at risk (OAR) sparing while maintaining target coverage compared to margin-based planning, increasing average OAR goal fulfillment probability by 13.3 percentage points and reducing 90th percentile OAR doses by an average of 3.5~Gy. For the brain case, probabilistic optimization improved target minimum dose passing probabilities (e.g., 88\% vs.~22\% for $D_{95}$) and brainstem maximum dose passing probability (70\% vs.~30\%), while maintaining comparable or improved OAR sparing compared to worst-case optimization.
  Probabilistic optimization enables explicit and interpretable control over goal fulfillment probabilities. Combining full treatment course modeling with efficient approximate dose calculation, the proposed framework improved the trade-off between target coverage and OAR sparing compared to conventional planning approaches in both photon and proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Application of Ideal Observer for Thresholded Data in Search Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study advances task-based image quality assessment by developing an anthropomorphic thresholded visual-search model observer. The model is an ideal observer for thresholded data inspired by the human visual system, allowing selective processing of high-salience features to improve discrimination performance. By filtering out irrelevant variability, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.
  The observer employs a two-stage framework: candidate selection and decision-making. Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.
  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance. These findings suggest that the proposed novel framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provide solutions for model observer training with limited resources. Our novel approach has applications in other areas where human visual search and detection tasks are modeled such as in computer vision, machine learning, defense and security image analysis.</description>

      <title>Predicting Region of Interest in Human Visual Search Based on Statistical Texture and Gabor Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human visual search behavior is a fundamental problem in vision science and computer vision, with direct implications for modeling how observers allocate attention in location-unknown search tasks. In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior. These findings highlight the value of combining structural and texture-based features for modeling visual search and support the development of perceptually informed observer models.</description>

      <title>Generative Consistency Models for Estimation of Kinetic Parametric Image Posteriors in Total-Body PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic total body positron emission tomography (TB-PET) makes it feasible to measure the kinetics of all organs in the body simultaneously which may lead to important applications in multi-organ disease and systems physiology. Since whole-body kinetics are highly heterogeneous with variable signal-to-noise ratios, parametric images should ideally comprise not only point estimates but also measures of posterior statistical uncertainty. However, standard Bayesian techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), are computationally prohibitive at the total body scale. We introduce a generative consistency model (CM) that generates samples from the posterior distributions of the kinetic model parameters given measured time-activity curves and arterial input function. CM is able to collapse the hundreds of iterations required by standard diffusion models into just 3 denoising steps. When trained on 500,000 physiologically realistic two-tissue compartment model simulations, the CM produces similar accuracy to MCMC (median absolute percent error &lt; 5%; median K-L divergence &lt; 0.5) but is more than five orders of magnitude faster. CM produces more reliable Ki images than the Patlak method by avoiding the assumption of irreversibility, while also offering valuable information on statistical uncertainty of parameter estimates and the underlying model. The proposed framework removes the computational barrier to routine, fully Bayesian parametric imaging in TB-PET and is readily extensible to other tracers and compartment models.</description>
