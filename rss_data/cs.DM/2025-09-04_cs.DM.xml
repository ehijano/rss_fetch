      <title>Mistake-bounded online learning with operation caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mistake-bound model of online learning with caps on the number of arithmetic operations per round. We prove general bounds on the minimum number of arithmetic operations per round that are necessary to learn an arbitrary family of functions with finitely many mistakes. We solve a problem on agnostic mistake-bounded online learning with bandit feedback from (Filmus et al, 2024) and (Geneson \&amp; Tang, 2024). We also extend this result to the setting of operation caps.</description>

      <title>Excluding a Ladder as an Induced Minor in Graphs Without Induced Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-ladder is the graph obtained from two disjoint paths, each with $k$ vertices, by joining the $i$th vertices of both paths with an edge for each $i\in\{ 1,\ldots,k\}$. In this paper, we show that for all positive integers $k$ and $d$, the class of all $K_{1,d}$-free graphs excluding the $k$-ladder as an induced minor has a bounded tree-independence number.
  We further show that our method implies a number of known results: We improve the bound on the tree-independence number for the class of $K_{1,d}$-free graphs not containing a wheel as an induced minor given by Choi, Hilaire, Milani\v{c}, and Wiederrecht. Furthermore, we show that the class of $K_{1,d}$-free graphs not containing a theta or a prism, whose paths have length at least $k$, as an induced subgraph has bounded tree-independence number. This improves a result by Chudnovsky, Hajebi, and Trotignon. Finally, we extend the induced Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa result of Ahn, Gollin, Huynh, and Kwon in $K_{1,d}$-free graphs from long induced cycles to any graph that is an induced minor of the $k$-ladder where every edge is subdivided exactly once.</description>

      <title>Drawing Trees and Cacti with Integer Edge Lengths on a Polynomial-Size Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strengthened version of Harborth's well-known conjecture -- known as Kleber's conjecture -- states that every planar graph admits a planar straight-line drawing where every edge has integer length and each vertex is restricted to the integer grid. Positive results for Kleber's conjecture are known for planar 3-regular graphs, for planar graphs that have maximum degree 4, and for planar 3-trees. However, all but one of the existing results are existential and do not provide bounds on the required grid size. In this paper, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing crossing-free straight-line drawings of trees and cactus graphs with integer edge lengths and integer vertex position on polynomial-size integer grids.</description>

      <title>Strong isometric path complexity of graphs: Asymptotic minors, restricted holes, and graph operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (strong) isometric path complexity is a recently introduced graph invariant that captures how arbitrary isometric paths (i.e., shortest paths) of a graph can be viewed as a union of a few ``rooted" isometric paths (i.e., isometric paths with a common end-vertex).
  We show that important graph classes studied in \emph{coarse graph theory} have bounded strong isometric path complexity. Let $U_t$ denote the graph obtained by adding a universal vertex to a path of $t-1$ edges. We show that the strong isometric path complexity of $U_t$-asymptotic minor-free graphs is bounded. This implies that $K_4^-$-asymptotic minor-free graphs, i.e., graphs that are quasi-isometric to a cactus [Fujiwara \&amp; Papasoglu '23], have bounded strong isometric path complexity. On the other hand, $K_4$-minor-free graphs have unbounded strong isometric path complexity. Hence, for a graph $H$ on at most four vertices, $H$-asymptotic minor-free graphs have bounded (strong) isometric path complexity if and only if $H\not=K_4$.
  We show that graphs whose all induced cycles of length at least 4 have the same length (also known as monoholed graphs as defined by [Cook et al., \textsc{JCTB '24}]) form a subclass of $U_4$-asymptotic minor-free graphs. Hence, the strong isometric path complexity of monoholed graphs is bounded. On the other hand, we show that even-hole free graphs have unbounded strong isometric path complexity.
  We investigate which graph operations preserve strong isometric path complexity. We show that the strong isometric path complexity is preserved under the \emph{fixed power} and \emph{line graph} operators, two important graph operations.
  We also show that the \emph{clique-sums} of finitely many graphs with strong isometric path complexity at most $k$, yield a graph with strong isometric path complexity at most $3k+18$.</description>

      <title>On the size of the neighborhoods of a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The d-neighborhood of a word W in the Levenshtein distance is the set of all words at distance at most d from W. Generating the neighborhood of a word W, or related sets of words such as the condensed neighborhood or the super-condensed neighborhood has applications in the design of approximate pattern matching algorithms. It follows that bounds on the maximum size of the neighborhood of words of a given length can be used in the complexity analysis of such approximate pattern matching algorithms. In this note, we present exact formulas for the size of the condensed and super condensed neighborhoods of a unary word, a novel upper bound for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length, and we prove a conjectured upper bound again for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length.</description>
