      <title>Explosive pulsed power to drive a vacuum tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of high-power pulsed radiation sources in any frequency range requires both generation of high power to drive the source and increasing the efficiency of supplied power to radiated electromagnetic field conversion. The former implies generation of high power (that is equal to high-voltage and high-current) pulses. The latter means use of an electron beam moving in vacuum to produce intense radiation: high electron beam current or high current density combined with large cross-section of interaction area are required. Explosive pulsed power could contribute to both of the above being capable to store and deliver much higher specific energy as compared to either dielectrics or magnetics and providing high flexibility for matching with a load by the use of a pulse forming network. Piecemeal matching of explosively driven power supply with the HPM producing load (vacuum tube) is described.</description>

      <title>Attention-aware convolutional neural networks for identification of magnetic islands in the tearing mode on EAST tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tearing mode, a large-scale MHD instability in tokamak, typically disrupts the equilibrium magnetic surfaces, leads to the formation of magnetic islands, and reduces core electron temperature and density, thus resulting in significant energy losses and may even cause discharge termination. This process is unacceptable for ITER. Therefore, the accurate identification of a magnetic island in real time is crucial for the effective control of the tearing mode in ITER in the future. In this study, based on the characteristics induced by tearing modes, an attention-aware convolutional neural network (AM-CNN) is proposed to identify the presence of magnetic islands in tearing mode discharge utilizing the data from ECE diagnostics in the EAST tokamak. A total of 11 ECE channels covering the range of core is used in the tearing mode dataset, which includes 2.5*10^9 data collected from 68 shots from 2016 to 2021 years. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (66.5%, 5.7%, and 27.8%), respectively. An attention mechanism is designed to couple with the convolutional neural networks to improve the capability of feature extraction of signals. During the model training process, we utilized adaptive learning rate adjustment and early stopping mechanisms to optimize performance of AM-CNN. The model results show that a classification accuracy of 91.96% is achieved in tearing mode identification. Compared to CNN without AM, the attention-aware convolutional neural networks demonstrate great performance across accuracy, recall metrics, and F1 score. By leveraging the deep learning model, which incorporates a physical understanding of the tearing process to identify tearing mode behaviors, the combination of physical mechanisms and deep learning is emphasized, significantly laying an important foundation for the future intelligent control of tearing mode dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ion acoustic and spin electron acoustic cnoidal waves in a spin polarized plasma with exchange effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separate spin evolution-quantum hydrodynamic (SSE-QHD) model is employed to address the nonlinear propagation of ion-acoustic wave (IAW) and spin electron-acoustic wave (SEAW) in a spin polarized electron-ion plasma. The analysis has been made under the self-consistent field approximation and with exchange correlation effects. The reductive perturbation method (RPM) is used to derive KdV equation and its cnoidal wave solutions. We noted that the phase velocity of IAW in the self-consistent field approximation is almost constant however, in the presence of exchange-correlation potential there is an abrupt change in the phase velocity. The phase velocity of SEAW decreases in the presence of exchange-correlation effects as compare to self-consistent field approximation. We have calculated the condition for the existence of \ nonlinear structures and it is found that \ in the presence of exchange effect the condition satisfy for certain values of $\eta$ at different densities. Furthermore, the comparisons have been made with and without exchange effects, it shows that although the nonlinear profiles of both waves are significantly\ affected with exchange effect but it also converts cnoidal structures of SEAW from rarefactive to compressive. The influence of exchange-correlation potential and spin polarization on the \ profiles of both nonlinear structures is evaluated numerically. The present study may be helpful to understand formation of \ new longitudinal cniondal structures in laboratory degenerate plasma.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-Taylor instability in inhomogeneous relativistic classical and degenerate electron-ion magnetoplasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) of electrostatic plane wave perturbations in compressible relativistic magnetoplasma fluids with thermal ions under gravity in three different cases of when (i) electrons are in isothermal equilibrium, i.e., classical or nondegenerate, (ii) electrons are fully degenerate (with $T_e=0$), and (iii) electrons are partially degenerate or have finite temperature degeneracy (with $T_e\neq0$). While in the cases of (i) and (iii), we focus on the regimes where the particle's thermal energy is more or less than the rest mass energy, i.e., $\beta_e \equiv k_{\mathrm B}T_e/{m_ec^2}&lt;1~\rm{or}~&gt;1$, the case (ii) considers from weakly to ultra-relativistic degenerate regimes. A general expression of the growth rate of instability is obtained and analyzed in the three different cases relevant to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, which generalize and advance the previous theory on RTI.</description>

      <title>Degradation of Cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum via Air, Oxygen, and Nitrogen low temperature plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms that possess the capability to convert light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. These organisms exhibit numerous potential applications, including the production of bioethanol, the synthesis of food colorants, the development of dietary supplements, and the provision of raw materials. Cyanobacteria demonstrate a wide ecological distribution, inhabiting diverse environments such as freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as extreme habitats including hot springs, hypersaline aquatic systems, polar regions, and low-oxygen environments. Plasma proves to be a highly effective method for cellular degradation. When Nostoc muscorum, a type of cyanobacterium, was exposed to air-source plasma plasma, it was completely destroyed within fifteen minutes. In contrast, the use of oxygen and nitrogen plasma required at least an hour to achieve the same result. The atmospheric plasma generated chemical species such as N2^+ , N^+ and OH^- at higher concentrations than the oxygen and nitrogen plasma. The plasma spectrum was measured during the treatment of the cyanobacteria, and the electron temperature and density of the air plasma were also estimated. The light absorption of the cyanobacteria's pigments and the characteristic Raman peaks disappeared after the plasma treatment, which served as clear evidence of the complete degradation of the cyanobacterium.</description>

      <title>Reactor-scale stellarators with force and torque minimized dipole coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we utilize new coil objectives for stellarator optimization with autodifferentiation, including pointwise and net coil-coil forces and torques. We use these methods to perform the first large-scale optimization of planar dipole coil arrays, since arrays of small and geometrically simple coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators, generate advantageous magnetic field perturbations in tokamaks, and provide active, real-time control capabilities. We perform an ablation study to show that minimizing the orientation and location of each coil may be essential to get coil forces, coil torques, and field errors to tolerable levels. We conclude by generating planar coil array solutions for three reactor-scale quasi-symmetric stellarators.</description>

      <title>Applicability of semi-classical theories in the strong field plasma regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many purposes, classical plasma dynamics models can work surprisingly well even for strong electromagnetic fields, approaching the Schwinger critical fields, and high frequencies, approaching the Compton frequency. However, the applicability of classical models tends to depend rather sensitively on the details of the problem. In the present paper, we study the specific case of plasma oscillations to draw a line between the classical and quantum relativistic regimes. Due to the field geometry of study, mechanisms like radiation reaction and Breit-Wheeler pair production, which tend to be important for electromagnetic fields, are rather effectively suppressed. Moreover, we find that the polarization current due to the electron spin is generally negligible for frequencies below the Compton frequency, compared to the free current, whose magnitude is well-approximated by the classical Vlasov theory. However, we show that pair creation due to the Schwinger mechanism can sometimes be important for surprisingly modest field strengths, of the order of 10 % of the critical field or even smaller. A rough guideline for when the classical Vlasov theory can be applied is given</description>

      <title>Single-Mode Wave Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual approach on electrostatic wave decay process for a weak beam-plasma system considers two different wave modes interplaying, the Langmuir and ion-sound mode. In the present paper, a single-mode approach is shown to be feasible for conditions where the respective dispersion relations undergo topological changes. Numerical solutions for the dispersion relation of a beam-plasma system are presented, supporting the modeling of an analytic dispersion relation of a single wave mode. This wave mode is accounted for in the kinetic equations for particles and waves, which rule the evolution of the system. The results are compared against the two-wave mode approach using Langmuir and ion-sound waves, within the context of weak turbulence theory. It is found that the single-mode approach can account for the basic features of particles and waves, since the single mode exhibits both low and high frequency regions, which ultimately play the roles of ion-sound and Langmuir modes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>
