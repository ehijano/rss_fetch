      <title>Off-shell color-kinematics duality from codifferentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the color-kinematics duality within the BV formalism, highlighting its emergence as a feature of specific gauge-fixed actions. Our goal is to establish a general framework for studying the duality while investigating straightforward examples of off-shell color-kinematics duality. In this context, we revisit Chern-Simons theory as well as introduce new examples, including BF theory and 2D Yang-Mills theory, which are shown to exhibit the duality off-shell. We emphasize that the geometric structures responsible for flat-space color-kinematics duality appear for general curved spaces as well.</description>

      <title>SYK-Schur duality: Double scaled SYK correlators from $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a triality relating the Double-Scaled SYK model, $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on a disk with an irregular singularity at the center and the outcome of ``real Schur quantization'' applied to $SU(2)$ Seiberg-Witten theory with Neumann boundary conditions. We give supporting evidence for our conjecture by establishing a precise match between a general class of correlators in all three systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topological classes of the rotating, accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work [D. Wu, Phys. Rev. D 108, 084041 (2023)] to more general cases by including a rotation parameter. We investigate the topological numbers for the rotating, accelerating neutral black hole and its AdS extension, as well as the rotating, accelerating charged black hole and its AdS extension. We find that the topological number of an asymptotically flat accelerating black hole consistently differs by one from that of its non-accelerating counterpart. Furthermore, we show that for an asymptotically AdS accelerating black hole, the topological number is reduced by one compared to its non-accelerating AdS counterpart. In addition, we demonstrate that within the framework of general relativity, the acceleration parameter and the negative cosmological constant each independently add one to the topological number. However, when both factors are present, their effects neutralize each other, resulting in no overall change to the topological number.</description>

      <title>Triple Product Amplitude from Chiral String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a worldsheet construction of a subset of triple product amplitudes proposed by Huang and Remmen. We start with closed bosonic strings but left and right-moving momenta are not necessarily equal. Instead, they satisfy certain conditions. We called them section conditions. These conditions are generalizations of the section condition in double field theory. The vertex operators of chiral strings have nontrivial monodromy, so we interpret them as attached to the end of defects. In the calculation of the amplitude, we not only have to integrate over the moduli space, we also have to sum over different defect configurations. Unitarity and other consistency conditions for chiral string amplitudes are checked. We found the graviton amplitude, the Virasoro amplitude, and also a special kind of amplitude that has one infinite spin tower. Similar kinds of amplitude have appeared in bootstrap literature. The more general $N$-point amplitude could be obtained from a modified KLT relation. The five-point chiral string amplitude is also explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible T-duality at Any Radius via Non-Compact SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the construction of the T-duality symmetry for the 2d compact boson to arbitrary values of the radius by including topological manipulations such as gauging continuous symmetries with flat connections. We show that the entire circle branch of the $c=1$ conformal manifold can be generated using these manipulations, resulting in a non-invertible T-duality symmetry when the gauging sends the radius to its inverse value. Using the recently proposed symmetry TFT describing continuous global symmetries of the boundary theory, we identify the topological operator corresponding to these new T-duality symmetries as an open condensation defect of the bulk theory, constructed by (higher) gauging an $\mathbb{R}$ subgroup of the bulk global symmetries. Notably, when the boundary theory is the compact boson with a rational square radius, this operator reduces to the familiar T-duality defect described by a Tambara-Yamagami fusion category. This construction thus naturally includes all possible discrete T-duality symmetries of the theory in a unified way.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Drinfel'd Doubles, Twists and All That... in Stringy Geometry and M Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drinfel'd double of Lie bialgebroids plays an important role in T-duality of string theories. In the presence of $H$ and $R$ fluxes, Lie bialgebroids should be extended to proto Lie bialgebroids. For both cases, the pair is given by two dual vector bundles, and the Drinfel'd double yields a Courant algebroid. However for U-duality, more complicated direct sum decompositions that are not described by dual vector bundles appear. In a previous work, we extended the notion of a Lie bialgebroid for vector bundles that are not necessarily dual. We achieved this by introducing a framework of calculus on algebroids and examining compatibility conditions for various algebroid properties in this framework. Here our aim is two-fold: extending our work on bialgebroids to include both $H$- and $R$-twists, and generalizing proto Lie bialgebroids to pairs of arbitrary vector bundles. To this end, we analyze various algebroid axioms and derive twisted compatibility conditions in the presence of twists. We introduce the notion of proto bialgebroids and their Drinfel'd doubles, where the former generalizes both bialgebroids and proto Lie bialgebroids. We also examine the most general form of vector bundle automorphisms of the double, related to twist matrices, that generate a new bracket from a given one. We analyze various examples from both physics and mathematics literatures in our framework.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Abelian Chern-Simons Higgs Model with New Inhomogeneous BPS Vacuum and Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inhomogeneous U(1) Chern-Simons Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit. The potential is sextic with both broken and unbroken phases, but its minimum varies spatially depending on the strength of the impurity. While the system lacks translation symmetry, it admits a supersymmetric extension. Depending on the sign of the impurity term, it has either a BPS sector or an anti-BPS sector (but not both), which satisfies the Bogomolny equations. The vacuum configuration of the broken phase is not simply determined by the the minimum of the potential since it is no longer constant, but it becomes a nontrivial function satisfying the Bogomolny equations. Thus, the energy and angular momentum densities of the vacuum locally have nonzero distributions, although the total energy and angular momentum remain zero. As in the homogeneous case, the theory supports various BPS soliton solutions, including topological and nontopological vortices and Q-balls. The vorticities as well as the U(1) charges are exclusively positive or negative. For a Gaussian type impurity as a specific example, we obtain rotationally symmetric numerical solutions and analyze their detailed properties.</description>

      <title>Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role. Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary, whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz. We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein equations and the equation for the vector potential</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries I: Covariant Wedge Algebra in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study gravitational symmetry algebras that live on 2-dimensional cuts $S$ of asymptotic infinity. We define a notion of wedge algebra $\mathcal{W}(S)$ which depends on the topology of $S$. For the cylinder $S=\mathbb{C}^*$ we recover the celebrated $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. For the 2-sphere $S^2$, the wedge algebra reduces to a central extension of the anti-self-dual projection of the Poincar\'e algebra. We then extend $\mathcal{W}(S)$ outside of the wedge space and build a new Lie algebra $\mathcal{W}_\sigma(S)$, which can be viewed as a deformation of the wedge algebra by a spin two field $\sigma$ playing the role of the shear at a cut of $\mathscr{I}$. This algebra represents the gravitational symmetry algebra in the presence of a non trivial shear and is characterized by a covariantized version of the wedge condition. Finally, we construct a dressing map that provides a Lie algebra isomorphism between the covariant and regular wedge algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we obtain and analyze a new class of analytical solutions of magnetically charged black bounces in k-essence theory, spherically symmetric in (3+1)-dimensions, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). We consider two metric models, Simpson-Visser and Bardeen, for the k-essence configurations n = 1/3 and n = 1/5. We obtain in an analytical way which scalar field, field potential, and Lagrangian NED are necessary to support the metrics. We analyze the behavior of these quantities and the energy conditions due to the scalar field and the NED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." We show that in some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

Abstract: We study the size and shape statistics of ground state fuzzy spheres when projected onto the transverse plane, utilizing the regularized SU(N=2) matrix model in D=(1+3)-dimensional spacetime. We show that they appear as ellipses, from matrix/membrane correspondence. With our numerical and analytical approximation for the ground state wavefunction, we provide estimations for their expected surface areas, perimeters, eccentricities, and shape-parameters. These geometric constants of quantum membranes deviate drastically from classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Knot invariants and indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore indefinite causal order between events in the context of quasiclassical spacetimes in superposition. We introduce several new quantifiers to measure the degree of indefiniteness of the causal order for an arbitrary finite number of events and spacetime configurations in superposition. By constructing diagrammatic and knot-theoretic representations of the causal order between events, we find that the definiteness or maximal indefiniteness of the causal order is topologically invariant. This reveals an intriguing connection between the field of quantum causality and knot theory. Furthermore, we provide an operational encoding of indefinite causal order and discuss how to incorporate a measure of quantum coherence into our classification.</description>

      <title>Harvesting magic from the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic is the quantum resource allowing a quantum computer to perform operations that cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computation. As such, generating magic in a quantum system is crucial for achieving quantum advantage. This letter shows that magic can be harvested by a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector (a qutrit) interacting with a quantum field in an initial vacuum state. While the idea of extracting resources from Quantum Field Theories (QFT) was born from the harvesting of entanglement, our result extends the protocol to evolve a qutrit from a non-magical state to a magical one, making it possible to generate magic from QFT.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Approach to Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillations of black hole spacetimes exhibit divergent behavior toward the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. This divergence can be understood as a consequence of the geometry in these spacetime regions. In contrast, black-hole oscillations are regular when evaluated toward the event horizon and null infinity. Hyperboloidal surfaces naturally connect these regions, providing a geometric regularization of time-harmonic oscillations called quasinormal modes (QNMs). This review traces the historical development of the hyperboloidal approach to QNMs. We discuss the physical motivation for the hyperboloidal approach and highlight current developments in the field.</description>

      <title>A remark on quantum measuring systems and the holographic principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a sort of ultimate question to examine the continuity of a quantum measurement subject theoretically and has not yet been resolved within a scientific framework. In this article, we approach this question and argue that the continuity of a quantum measurement subject follows as a fundamental consequence of the holographic principle after the classicalization of the quantum state of the bulk space.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of Gaussian unitary transformations for bosonic and fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian unitary transformations are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians containing quadratic terms in creations and annihilation operators, and are heavily used in many areas of quantum physics, ranging from quantum optics and condensed matter theory to quantum information and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. They are known to form a representation of the metaplectic and spin group for bosons and fermions, respectively. These groups are the double covers of the symplectic and special orthogonal group, respectively, and our goal is to analyze the behavior of the sign ambiguity that one needs to deal with when moving between these groups and their double cover. We relate this sign ambiguity to expectation values of the form $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$, where $|0\rangle$ is a Gaussian state and $\hat{H}$ an arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian. We provide closed formulas for $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$ and show how we can efficiently describe group multiplications in the double cover without the need of going to a faithful representation on an exponentially large or even infinite-dimensional space. Our construction relies on an explicit parametrization of these two groups (metaplectic, spin) in terms of symplectic and orthogonal group elements together with a twisted U(1) group.</description>

      <title>Extended Metric-Affine $f(R)$ Gravity with Dynamical Connection in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the usual vacuum Metric-Affine $f(R)$ Gravity by supplementing it with all parity even quadratic invariants in torsion and non-metricity. As we show explicitly this supplementation drastically changes the status of the Theory which now propagates an additional scalar degree of freedom on top of the graviton. This scalar degree of freedom has a geometric origin as it relates to spacetime torsion and non-metricity. The resulting Theory can be written equivalently as a metric and torsionless Scalar-Tensor Theory whose potential and kinetic term coupling depend on the choice of the function $f(R)$ and the dimensionless parameters of the quadratic invariants respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the complete four loop perturbative renormalization of a low temperature statistical mechanics model of flat polymerized membranes. Within a non-local effective flexural theory based on transverse elastic fluctuations, we determine analytically, at the four existing fixed points, the anomalous elasticity critical exponent $\eta$ which controls all scaling behaviors in the theory. Results are obtained as apparently convergent series, enabling precise estimates without resummations. We independently confirm and complement the results of recent four-loop work [Pikelner 2022 EPL 138 17002] carried out in a different model. We also find good agreement with non-perturbative approaches and experiments on soft materials and graphene.</description>

      <title>Analyzing gravitational wave effects in general modified gravity: an example based on the most general vector-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Isaacson picture provides a general method for describing the effects of gravitational waves, established on two sets of basic equations. The first set of equations describes the propagation of gravitational waves within a given background, while the second set elucidates the interaction between the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves and the background metric. These two sets of equations are typically derived by expanding the field equations to second-order perturbations. In addition to the method of perturbing field equations, there is an alternative method: obtaining the two sets of basic equations by expanding the action to the second-order of perturbations. In this paper, we elaborate on this method, establishing its foundations more rigorously. Especially, the second-order perturbation action, with the Minkowski metric as the background, contains all necessary information to construct the Isaacson picture far from the source. We outline the derivation of the two sets of basic equations to describe the gravitational wave effects in the Isaacson picture, based on the second-order perturbation action. This will enable us to analyze the following effects: polarizations of gravitational waves, the wave speed for each polarization mode, the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves, and the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves. We illustrate this method by applying it to the most general second-order vector-tensor theory including parity-breaking terms. We further analyze the polarization modes of gravitational waves in this theory. We highlight that this method facilitates model-independent research on various gravitational wave effects in general modified gravity theories. These effects are anticipated to be identified by the upcoming generation of gravitational wave detectors, aimed at testing potential modifications to gravity theory.</description>

Abstract: The light rays trajectories in Kerr metric, resulting from Fermat's principle, are considered from the point of view of integrable systems. It is shown how the counterpart of Carter constant emerges as a result of coupling-constant metamorphosis. The latter provides a convenient method of describing the null geodesics in Kerr metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength gravitons during primordial inflation endows graviton loop corrections with secular growth factors. During a prolonged period of inflation these factors eventually overwhelm the small loop-counting parameter of $G H^2$, causing perturbation theory to break down. A technique was recently developed for summing the leading secular effects at each order in non-linear sigma models, which possess the same kind of derivative interactions as gravity. This technique combines a variant of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism with a variant of the renormalization group. We generalize the new technique to quantum gravity, resulting in a Langevin equation in which secular changes in gravitational phenomena are driven by stochastic fluctuations of the graviton field.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers. Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.</description>

      <title>On (spinor)-helicity and bosonization in $AdS_4/CFT_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helicity is a useful concept both for AdS${}_4$ and CFT${}_3$ studies. We work out the complete AdS${}_4$/CFT${}_3$ dictionary for spinning fields/operators in the spinor-helicity base that allows one to scalarize any $n$-point contact vertex. AdS${}_4$-vertices encode correlation functions of conserved currents, stress-tensor and, more generally, higher spin currents in a simple way. We work out the dictionary for Yang-Mills- and gravity-type theories with higher derivative corrections as well as some higher spin examples and exemplify the relation to the three-dimensional bosonization duality. The bosonization can be understood as a simple surgery: vertices/correlators are built via an EM-duality transformation by sewing together (anti)-Chiral higher spin gravities, to whose existence the three-dimensional bosonization duality can be attributed (up to the proof of uniqueness).</description>

      <title>Decay channels for double extremal black holes in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore decay channels for charged black holes with vanishing temperature in $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric compactifications of string theory. If not protected by supersymmetry, such extremal black holes are expected to decay as a consequence of the weak gravity conjecture. We concentrate on double extremal, non-supersymmetric black holes for which the values of the scalar fields are constant throughout space-time, and explore decay channels for which decay into BPS and anti-BPS constituents is energetically favorable. We demonstrate the existence of decay channels at tree level for large families of double extremal black holes. For specific charges, we also find stable non-supersymmetric black holes, suggesting recombination of (anti)-supersymmetric constituents to a non-supersymmetric object.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle from the Regularized Self-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Schr\"odinger--Newton equation to calculate the regularized self-energy of the particle using a regular self-gravitational and electrostatic potential derived in the string T-duality. The particle mass $M$ is no longer concentrated into a point but it is diluted and described by a quantum-corrected smeared energy density resulting in corrections to the energy of the particle which is interpreted as a regularized self-energy. We extend our results and find corrections to the relativistic particles using the Klein-Gordon, Proca, and Dirac equations. An important finding is that we extract a form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) from the corrected energy. The form of GUP is shown to depend on the nature of particles; namely, for bosons (spin $0$ and spin $1$) we obtain a quadratic form of GUP, while for fermions (spin $1/2$) we obtain a linear form of GUP. The correlation we found between spin and GUP may offer insights into investigating quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Weyl conformal geometry vs Weyl anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl conformal geometry is a gauge theory of scale invariance that naturally brings together the Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity. The SM embedding in this geometry is possible without new degrees of freedom beyond SM and Weyl geometry, while Einstein gravity is generated by the broken phase of this symmetry. This follows a Stueckelberg breaking mechanism in which the Weyl gauge boson becomes massive and decouples, as discussed in the past (arXiv:1812.08613, 1904.06596, 2104.15118). However, Weyl anomaly could break explicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We first note that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to a new differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariant formulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism that enables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather than use a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariance in $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of their derivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. A natural, Weyl-invariant dimensional regularisation of quantum corrections exists and Weyl gauge symmetry is then maintained and manifest at the quantum level, in $d$ dimensions. This is related to a non-trivial current of this symmetry, the divergence of which cancels the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The "usual" Weyl anomaly and Riemannian geometry are recovered in the (spontaneously) broken phase. The relation to holographic Weyl anomaly is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interactions of the higher-spin gauge theory arising from the IKKT matrix model on a covariant quantum FLRW quantum space-time $\mathcal{M}^{1,3}_{\mathtt{J}}$, denoted as HS-IKKT. In particular, we elaborate some of the vertices and observe that they are not manifestly Lorentz invariant in the unitary formulation. We argue that Lorentz invariance of HS-IKKT can be recovered since Lorentz transformations are part of the gauge invariance in the covariant formulation. This statement is verified for some vertices with the lowest number of derivatives. The lowest-derivative sector of this theory is expected to be governed by an ``almost''-Lorentz-invariant Yang-Mills theory coupled to emergent gravity.</description>

Abstract: We consider 3+1 dimensional Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) coupled to the dilaton and the graviton. We show that the graviton-dilaton scattering amplitude receives a universal contribution which is helicity flipping and is proportional to $\Delta c-\Delta a$ along any RG flow, where $\Delta c$ and $\Delta a$ are the differences of the UV and IR $c$- and $a$-trace anomalies respectively. This allows us to relate $\Delta c-\Delta a$ to spinning massive states in the spectrum of the QFT. We test our predictions in two simple examples: in the theory of a massive free scalar and in the theory of a massive Dirac fermion (a more complicated example is provided in a companion paper [1]). We discuss possible applications.</description>

Abstract: Chiral higher spin gravity is defined in terms of a strong homotopy algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type (noncommutative Poisson structure). All structure maps are given by the integrals over the configuration space of concave polygons and the first two maps are related to the (Shoikhet-Tsygan-)Kontsevich Formality. As with the known formality theorems, we prove the $A_\infty$-relations via Stokes' theorem by constructing a closed form and a configuration space whose boundary components lead to the $A_\infty$-relations. This gives a new way to formulate higher spin gravities and hints at a construct encompassing the known formality theorems.</description>

Abstract: We use perturbation theory to construct a family of time-dependent microstrata: a set of non-extremal solutions of IIB supergravity asymptotic to $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$. Our construction shows that the "special locus" constraints of arXiv:2307.13021 can be broken by allowing the solutions to depend on time. We study the secular terms appearing in the perturbation theory. Some of them can be resummed into frequency shifts, with the same interpretation as for the previously-studied microstrata solutions. Other secular terms appear harder to resum, questioning the long-term stability of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Low spin solutions of Higher Spin Gravity: BPST instanton</title>

Abstract: Higher spin gravities do not have a low energy limit where higher-spin fields decouple from gravity. Nevertheless, it is possible to construct fine-tuned exact solutions that activate low-spin fields without sourcing the higher-spin fields. We show that BPST (Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin) instanton is an exact solution of Chiral Higher Spin Gravity, i.e. it is also a solution of the holographic dual of Chern-Simons matter theories. This gives an example of a low-spin solution. The instanton sources the opposite helicity spin-one field and a scalar field. We derive an Effective Field Theory that describes the coupling between an instanton and the other two fields, whose action starts with the Chalmers-Siegel action and has certain higher derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Gravity effects on electromagnetic properties of charged leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac equation that incorporates a $\gamma^0 \gamma_5$-Lorentz-symmetry violating (LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic neutrinos, which suggests that the speed, in vacuum, in connection with the geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes the energy-dependent form, e.g., $v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\textrm{LSV}}$, with $E_{\textrm{LSV}} \approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way to understand this picture consistently, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.</description>

      <title>$1/N$ Corrections in $\text{QCD}_2$: Small Mass Limit and Threshold States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $1/N$ corrections to mesonic spectrum in $1+1$-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ($\text{QCD}_2$) with fundamental quarks using effective Hamiltonian method. We express the corrections in terms of 't Hooft equation solutions. First, we consider 2-flavor model with a heavy and a light quark. We show that, in contrast to some claims in earlier literature, the $1/N$ correction to the mass of the heavy-light meson remains finite when the light quark mass is taken to zero. Nevertheless, the corrections become significantly larger in this limit; we attribute this to the presence of massless modes in the spectrum. We also study the corrections to the lightest meson mass in 1-flavor model and show that they are consistent with recent numerical data, but not with the prediction coming from bosonization. Then we study low energy effective theory for 2 flavors. We show that the 3-meson interaction vertex correctly reproduces Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) coupling when both quarks become massless. This coupling does not change even if one of the quarks is massive. We employ Discretized Light Cone Quatization (DLCQ) to check the continuum results and show that the improved version can be used for small quark mass. Finally, we study the states associated with $1\to 2$ meson thresholds. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that when the decay is allowed by parity, the infinite $N$ theory has near-threshold bound states that mix one- and two-meson parts. They are $1/3$ two-meson and $2/3$ one-meson and the corrections to their masses have unusual scaling $\sim 1/N^{2/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Successful applications of a conceptually novel setup of Quantum Field Theory, that accounts for all subtheories of the Standard Model (QED, Electroweak Interaction and Higgs, Yang-Mills and QCD) and beyond (Helicity 2), call for a perspective view in a broader conceptual context. The setting is "autonomous" in the sense of being intrinsically quantum. Its principles are: Hilbert space, Poincar\'e symmetry and causality. Its free quantum fields are obtained from Wigner's unitary representations of the Poincar\'e group, with only physical and observable degrees of freedom. A "quantization" of an "underlying" classical theory is not needed. It allows renormalizable perturbation theory with interactions whose detailed structure, and in some cases even the particle content, is predicted by internal consistency. The results confirm and extend observable predictions for the interactions of the SM without assuming a "principle" of gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the classical Regge growth conjecture in the 4d effective field theory that results from compactifying $D$-dimensional General Relativity on a compact, Ricci-flat manifold. While the higher dimensional description is given in terms of pure Einstein gravity and the conjecture is automatically satisfied, it imposes several non-trivial constraints in the 4d spectrum. Namely, there must be either none or an infinite number of massive spin-2 modes, and the mass ratio between consecutive Kaluza-Klain spin-2 replicas is bounded by the 4d coupling constants.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Species Thermodynamics and the Black Hole - Tower Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Species thermodynamics has been proposed in analogy to black hole thermodynamics. The entropy scales like an area and is given by the mere counting of the number of the species. In this work, we $\textit{derive}$ the constitutive relations of species thermodynamics and explain how those $\textit{originate}$ from standard thermodynamics. We consider configurations of species in thermal equilibrium inside a box of size $L$, and show that the temperature $T$ of the system, which plays a crucial role, is always upper bounded above by the species scale $\Lambda_{\rm sp}$. We highlight three relevant regimes: (i) when $L^{-1}&lt; T&lt;\Lambda_{\rm sp}$, and gravitational collapse is avoided, the system exhibits standard thermodynamics features, for example, with the entropy scaling like the volume of the box; (ii) in the limit $L^{-1}\simeq T\rightarrow \Lambda_{\rm sp}$ we recover the rules of species thermodynamics with the entropy scaling like the area of the box; (iii) an intermediate regime with $ L^{-1}\simeq T&lt; \Lambda_{\rm sp}$ that avoids gravitational collapse and fulfills the Covariant Entropy Bound; this interpolates between the previous two regimes and its entropy is given simply in terms of the counting of the species contributing to the thermodynamic ensemble. This study also allows us to find a novel and independent bottom-up rationale for the Emergent String Conjecture. Finally, we present the $\textit{Black Hole - Tower Correspondence}$ as a generalization of the celebrated Black Hole - String Correspondence. This provides us with a robust framework to interpret the results of our thermodynamic investigation. Moreover, it allows us to qualitatively account for the entropy of black holes in terms of the degrees of freedom of the weakly coupled species in the tower.</description>

      <title>Spin cobordism and the gauge group of type I/heterotic string theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cobordism offers a unique perspective into the non-perturbative sector of string theory by demanding the absence of higher form global symmetries for quantum gravitational consistency. In this work we compute the spin cobordism groups of the classifying space of $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ relevant to describing type I/heterotic string theory and explore their (shared) non-perturbative sector. To facilitate this we leverage our knowledge of type I D-brane physics behind the related ko-homology. The computation utilizes several established tools from algebraic topology, the focus here is on two spectral sequences. First, the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is used to obtain the cohomology of the classifying space of the $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. This will enable us to start the Adams spectral sequence for finally obtaining our result, the spin cobordism groups. We conclude by providing a string theoretic interpretation to the cobordism groups.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models from non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the study of non-invertible symmetries, we propose there exist infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(kq + I, q) \to\mathcal{M}(kq-I, q)$ induced by $\phi_{(1,2k+1)}$. They vastly generalize the previously proposed ones $k=I=1$ by Zamolodchikov, $k=1, I&gt;1$ by Ahn and L\"assig, and $k=2$ by Dorey et al. All the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the literature (e.g. $\mathcal{M}(10,3) \to \mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov et al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a complete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$ fusion ring.</description>

      <title>D-Brane Effective Lagrangian in Spacetimes with Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the transformation of $D_p$-branes to $D_{p-1}$-branes under T-duality when the $D$-brane is embedded in a spacetime with a boundary. Our goal is to derive the higher-derivative corrections to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian for both the bulk and boundary terms.
  For the bulk terms, we calculate the $\alpha'$ corrections for the massless open string fields, up to the 8th order in the dimensionless Maxwell field strength. We demonstrate that the bulk Lagrangian can satisfy the T-duality constraint without residual total derivative terms in the base space. This determines the most general independent couplings of the massless open string fields in the bulk Lagrangian, encompassing 145 coupling constants, up to three parameters. Two of these parameters are physical and are determined by disk-level S-matrix elements, while the third is unphysical and can be eliminated by field redefinitions and integration by parts. The final result for the bulk Lagrangian consists of 49 couplings.
  For the boundary terms, the application of T-duality symmetry to massless open and closed string fields enables us to extend the DBI Lagrangian to include the boundary unit normal vector field $n_\mu$ and its first derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the scattering distance is identified as the entanglement wedge cross-section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the waist cross-section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. This connection is not only a coincidence rooted in hyperbolic geometry; it also reflects an additional correspondence between two distinct theories: mutual information and the geometric BV master equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$ with pure NS-NS flux. We first construct physical vertex operators that correspond to long strings. Due to the GSO projection, they depend on the parity of the spectral flow parameter $w$. For a given $w$, we construct the physical operators that have the lowest space-time weights in both the NS and R sector. Then, we calculate three point correlators for each possible type of parities of spectral flows. We find that the recursion relations of correlators in the bosonic SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model can be understood from the equivalence of these superstring correlators with different picture choices. Furthermore, after carefully mapping the vertex operators to appropriate operators in the dual CFT, we find that once the fermionic contributions together with the picture changing effects are correctly taken into account, some mathematical identities of covering maps lead to the matching of the correlators of the two sides. We check this explicitly at the leading order in the conformal perturbation computation and conjecture that this remains correct to all orders.</description>

Abstract: This article shows that the approach to generalised curvature and torsion pioneered by Polacek and Siegel [1] is a generalisation of Cartan Geometry -- rendering latter natural from the point of view of O(d,d)-generalised geometry. We present this approach in the generalised metric formalism and show that almost all parts of the additional higher generalised tensors appearing in this approach correspond to covariant derivatives of the generalised Riemann tensor. As an application, we use this framework to phrase sigma model dynamics in an explicitly covariant way -- both under generalised diffeomorphisms and local gauge transformations.</description>

Abstract: We study the cohomology of an elliptic differential complex arising from the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic string theory. We compute these cohomology groups at the standard embedding, and show that they decompose into a direct sum of cohomologies. While this is often assumed in the literature, it had not been explicitly demonstrated. Given a stable gauge bundle over a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle and no holomorphic vector fields, we also show that the Euler characteristic of this differential complex is zero. This points towards a perfect obstruction theory for the heterotic moduli problem, at least for the most physically relevant compactifications.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>

      <title>Are these quasi-normal modes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how to extract numerically the expected lowest quasi-normal mode (QNM) associated with the pressure anisotropy for a Bjorken flux evolution to equilibrium. This QNM was easily decoded subtracting the hydrodynamical attractors and was compared with other authors calculations. After evolutions with transients close to the expected lowest QNM the system goes to a tail (pure imaginary frequency) for late times. We analyze the relevance of Navier-Stokes, second order and Borel attractors at each stage of the evolution, which begins far-from-equilibrium and ends close to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Collisions of false-vacuum bubble walls in a quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate, using nonperturbative methods, the real-time dynamics of small bubbles of "false vacuum" in a quantum spin chain near criticality, where the low-energy physics is described by a relativistic (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. We consider bubbles whose walls are kink and antikink quasiparticle excitations, so that wall collisions are kink-antikink scattering events. To construct these bubbles in the presence of strong correlations, we extend a recently proposed matrix product state (MPS) ansatz for quasiparticle wavepackets. We simulate dynamics within a window of about 1000 spins embedded in an infinite chain at energies of up to about 5 times the mass gap. By choosing the wavepacket width and the bubble size appropriately, we avoid strong lattice effects and observe relativistic kink-antikink collisions. We use the MPS quasiparticle ansatz to detect scattering outcomes. (i) In the Ising model, with transverse and longitudinal fields, we do not observe particle production despite nonintegrability (supporting recent observations of nonthermalizing states in this model). (ii) Switching on an additional interaction, we see production of confined and unconfined particle pairs. We characterize the amount of entanglement generated as a function of energy and time and conclude that our classical simulation methods will ultimately fail as these increase. We anticipate that kink-antikink scattering in 1+1 dimensions will be an instructive benchmark problem for future quantum computers and analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Optimal light cone for macroscopic particle transport in long-range systems: A quantum speed limit approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ultimate rate at which information propagates is a pivotal issue in nonequilibrium physics. Nevertheless, the task of elucidating the propagation speed inherent in quantum bosonic systems presents challenges due to the unbounded nature of their interactions. In this study, we tackle the problem of macroscopic particle transport in a long-range generalization of the lattice Bose-Hubbard model through the lens of the quantum speed limit. By developing a unified approach based on optimal transport theory, we rigorously prove that the minimum time required for macroscopic particle transport is always bounded by the distance between the source and target regions, while retaining its significance even in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the probability of observing a specific number of bosons inside the target region, thereby providing additional insights into the dynamics of particle transport. Our results hold true for arbitrary initial states under both long-range hopping and long-range interactions, thus resolving an open problem of particle transport in generic bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for non-local spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Ultracollinear Paradox with Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Naive intuition about scale decoupling breaks down in the presence of fermion masses. Kinematic enhancements can greatly extend the range where one needs to keep a finite mass in calculations to obtain a correct result at even the O(1) level. Treating a light fermion as massive though, leads to a known but somewhat obscure paradox, a seeming leading-order sensitivity to an arbitrarily small mass. We show how a proper formulation in effective field theory not only resolves the physical conundrum, but answers the very practical question of when fermion masses are required. This has important implications for the development of shower Monte Carlo above the weak scale.</description>

      <title>Explanation for the absence of secondary peaks in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infer the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we find that PBHs are ruled out within the mass range $\sim[10^{-24},10^{-19}]M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-16}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>
