      <title>Strongly Minimal Relics of T-convex Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing previous work on algebraically closed valued fields (ACVF) and o-minimal fields, we study strongly minimal relics of real closed valued fields (RCVF), and more generally T-convex expansions of o-minimal fields. Our main result (replicating the o-minimal setting) is that non-locally modular strongly minimal definable relics of T-convex fields must be two-dimensional. We also continue our work on reducing the trichotomy for general relics of a structure to just the relics of certain distinguished sorts. To this end, we prove that the trichotomy for definable RCVF-relics implies the trichotomy for interpretable RCVF-relics, and also that the trichotomy for relics of o-minimal fields implies the trichotomy for relics of any dense o-minimal structure. Finally, we introduce the class of differentiable Hausdorff geometric fields (containing o-minimal fields and various valued fields), and give a general treatment of the trichotomy for one-dimensional relics of such fields (namely, reducing the trichotomy for one-dimensional relics to an axiomatic condition on the field itself).</description>

      <title>On orthogonal types to the value group and residual domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a unifying framework of residual domination for henselian valued fields of equicharacteristic zero, encompassing some valued fields with operators. We introduce a general definition for residual domination and show that it is well behaved. For instance, we prove a change of base theorem for residual domination over algebraically closed sets. We show that the class of residually dominated types coincides with the types that are orthogonal to the value group, and with the class of types whose reduct to $\ACVF$ (the theory of algebraically closed valued fields with a non-trivial valuation) are generically stable.
  If the residue field is stable, we show that an $\A$-invariant type concentrated on the field sort is orthogonal to the value group if and only if it is generically stable. If the residue field is simple, the theory of the valued field is $\NTP_{2}$ and algebraically closed sets of imaginary parameters are extension basis, we show that an $\A$-invariant type concentrated on the field sort is orthogonal to the value group if and only if it is generically simple. Examples of the simple case, among others, include the limit theory $\VFA_{0}$ of the Frobenius automorphism acting on an algebraically closed valued field of characteristic $\p$ (where $\p$ tends to infinity), as well as non-principal ultraproducts of the $\p$-adics.</description>

      <title>Classifying different criteria for learning algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years there has been a growing interest in the study of learning problems associated with algebraic structures. The framework we use models the scenario in which a learner is given larger and larger fragments of a structure from a given target family and is required to output an hypothesis about the structure's isomorphism type. So far researchers focused on $\mathbf{Ex}$-learning, in which the learner is asked to eventually stabilize to the correct hypothesis, and on restrictions where the learner is allowed to change the hypothesis a fixed number of times. Yet, other learning paradigms coming from classical algorithmic learning theory remained unexplored. We study the "learning power" of such criteria, comparing them via descriptive-set-theoretic tools thanks to the novel notion of $E$-learnability. The main outcome of this paper is that such criteria admit natural syntactic characterizations in terms of infinitary formulas analogous to the one given for $\mathbf{Ex}$-learning in [6]. Such characterizations give a powerful method to understand whether a family of structure is learnable with respect to the desired criterion.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of infinite towers of Kummer extensions of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, assuming resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, an analogue of Siegel's theorem on sum of squares in positive characteristic. The method of proof combines techniques from central simple algebras with model theory and builds on work of Anscombe, Dittmann and Fehm.
  As an application, we show that, for each finite field $\mathbb{F}$ of odd characteristic and any positive integer $n$ coprime with the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$, the first-order theory of the field given by the compositum of the fields generated by adjoining the $n$--th roots of all monic irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[t]$, of degree divisible by $n$ is undecidable in the language of rings with the variable $t$ as a constant.</description>

      <title>AC and the Independence of the Law of Trichotomy in Second-Order Henkin Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the set HAC of 1-1 Ackermann axioms of choice in second-order predicate logic with Henkin interpretation (HPL). To answer a question posed by Michael Rathjen, we restrict the proof that the basic Fraenkel model of second order is a model of all n-m Ackermann axioms to the case where the Ackermann axioms are in HAC. In the second part, we show the independence of Hartogs' version of the law of trichotomy (TR) from HAC in HPL. A generalization of the latter proof implies the independence of TR from all Ackermann axioms in HPL. We conclude the paper with an open problem.</description>

      <title>A non-de Finetti theorem for countable Euclidian spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical de Finetti Theorem classifies the $\mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb N)$-invariant probability measures on $[0,1]^{\mathbb N}$. More precisely it states that those invariant measures are combinations of measures of the form $\nu^{\mathbb N}$ where $\nu$ is a measure on $[0,1]$. Recently, Jahel--Tsankov generalized this theorem showing that under conditions on $M$, the $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant measures on $[0,1]^M$ are mixes of measures of the form $\nu^M$ where $\nu$ is a measure on $[0,1]$. In this note, we give an example of a non-de Finetti non-Archimedian group.</description>

      <title>Limits of structures and Total NP Search Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an infinite class of finite graphs of unbounded size, we define a limit object, to be called a $\textit{wide limit}$, relative to some computationally restricted class of functions. The limit object is a first order Boolean-valued structure. The first order properties of the wide limit then reflect how a computationally restricted viewer "sees" a generic member of the class. The construction uses arithmetic forcing with random variables [Kraj\'i\v{c}ek, Forcing with random variables and proof complexity 2011]. We give sufficient conditions for universal and existential sentences to be valid in the limit, provide several examples, and prove that such a limit object can then be expanded to a model of weak arithmetic.
  To illustrate the concept we give an example in which the wide limit relates to total NP search problems. In particular, we take the wide limit of all maps from $\{0,\dots,k-1\}$ to $\{0,\dots,\lfloor k/2\rfloor-1\}$ to obtain a model of $\forall \text{PV}_1(f)$ where the problem $\textbf{RetractionWeakPigeon}$ is total but $\textbf{WeakPigeon}$, the complete problem for $\textbf{PWPP}$, is not. Thus, we obtain a new proof of this unprovability and show it implies that $\textbf{WeakPigeon}$ is not many-one reducible to $\textbf{RetractionWeakPigeon}$ in the oracle setting.</description>

      <title>Chain Bounding, the leanest proof of Zorn's lemma, and an illustration of computerized proof formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exposition of the *Chain Bounding Lemma*, which is a common generalization of both Zorn's Lemma and the Bourbaki-Witt fixed point theorem. The proofs of these results through the use of Chain Bounding are amongst the simplest ones that we are aware of. As a by-product, we show that for every poset $P$ and function $f$ from the powerset of $P$ into $P$, there exists a maximal well-ordered chain whose family of initial segments is appropriately closed under $f$.
  We also provide an introduction to the process of "computer formalization" of mathematical proofs by using *proofs assistants*. As an illustration, we verify our main results with the Lean proof assistant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new proof of descent for stably dominated types in any theory, dropping the hypothesis of the existence of global invariant extensions. Additionally, we give a much simpler proof of descent for stably dominated types in $\ACVF$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any stable set in an $\NIP$ theory has the bounded stabilizing property. This result is subsequently used to correct Proposition 6.7 from the book on stable domination and independence in $\ACVF$.</description>

      <title>Effective weak convergence and tightness of measures in computable Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prokhorov's Theorem in probability theory states that a family $\Gamma$ of probability measures on a Polish space is tight if and only if every sequence in $\Gamma$ has a weakly convergent subsequence. Due to the highly non-constructive nature of (relative) sequential compactness, however, the effective content of this theorem has not been studied. To this end, we generalize the effective notions of weak convergence of measures on the real line due to McNicholl and Rojas to computable Polish spaces. Then, we introduce an effective notion of tightness for families of measures on computable Polish spaces. Finally, we prove an effective version of Prokhorov's Theorem for computable sequences of probability measures.</description>
