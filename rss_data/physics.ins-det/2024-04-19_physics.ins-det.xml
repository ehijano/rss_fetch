      <title>Hydrogen plasma inhibits ion beam restructuring of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focused ion beam (FIB) techniques are employed widely for nanofabrication, and processing of materials and devices. However, ion irradiation often gives rise to severe damage due to atomic displacements that cause defect formation, migration and clustering within the ion-solid interaction volume. The resulting restructuring degrades the functionality of materials, and limits the utility FIB ablation and nanofabrication techniques. Here we show that such restructuring can be inhibited by performing FIB irradiation in a hydrogen plasma environment via chemical pathways that modify defect binding energies and transport kinetics, as well as material ablation rates. The method is minimally-invasive and has the potential to greatly expand the utility of FIB nanofabrication techniques in processing of functional materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Calibration of hydrogen atoms measurement by femtosecond two-photon laser induced fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections $\sigma^{(2)}$ for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The obtained estimate of the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.034\pm 0.006$, which is almost twenty times lower than the values previously obtained using narrowband nanosecond lasers. This difference is explained by the significantly different spectral width of the excitation line, and demonstrates the need for independent calibration of the TALIF measurements in the femtosecond range.</description>

      <title>Multichannel-GaAsP-photomultiplier-based fiber bundle ISM-STED microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usage of a GaAsP (gallium arsenide phosphide) photomultiplier for microscopical imaging allows the evaluation of low-light luminescent objects. We designed a setup for collecting a confocal microscopic image signal, which is divided into 14 equal-sized input channels. The division is achieved with a beamsplitter and two fiber bundles consisting of seven fibers each. Re-imaging the confocal pinhole by such a densely packed fiber bundle permits the utilization of a photon re-localization approach to overcome the optical resolution limit. The center fiber creates a real-time image, while the outer fibers enable a higher-resolution image via an image scanning microscope (ISM) signal calculation. The fiber bundles are enclosed in a fused silica capillary and are drawn out to create one solid fiber bundle. During the drawing process, the fiber bundles are tapered down to an outer diameter size of 400 {\mu}m, with each fiber having a less than 0.3 Airy unit diameter. For the photomultiplier interface, all fibers of both fiber bundles are integrated into a v-groove array, with each fiber representing a detection input, which is followed by projection optics for imaging onto the multichannel detector. The resulting confocal super-resolution microscope is suitable for the application of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) techniques such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), time-resolved anisotropy, or F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging</description>

      <title>Study on the static detection of ICF target based on muonic X-ray sphere encoded imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) was discovered by Chinese physicist Zhang Wenyu as early as 1947, and it can conduct non-destructive elemental analysis inside samples. Research has shown that MIXE can retain the high efficiency of direct imaging while benefiting from the low noise of pinhole imaging through encoding holes. The related technology significantly improves the counting rate while maintaining imaging quality. The sphere encoding technology effectively solves the imaging blurring caused by the tilting of the encoding system, and successfully images micrometer sized X-ray sources. This paper will combine MIXE and X-ray sphere coding imaging techniques, including ball coding and zone plates, to study the method of non-destructive deep structure imaging of ICF targets and obtaining sub element distribution. This method aims to develop a new method for ICF target detection, which is particularly important for inertial confinement fusion. At the same time, this method can be used to detect and analyze materials that are difficult to penetrate or sensitive, and is expected to solve the problem of element resolution and imaging that traditional technologies cannot overcome. It will provide new methods for the future development of multiple fields such as particle physics, material science, and X-ray optics.</description>

      <title>The Required Spatial Resolution to Assess Imbalance using Plantar Pressure Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roughly 1/3 of adults older than 65 fall each year, resulting in more than 3 million emergency room visits, thousands of deaths, and over $50 Billion in direct costs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 1/3 of falls are preventable with effective mitigation strategies, particularly for imbalance. Therefore, quantification of imbalance is being studied extensively in recent years. In this study we investigate the feasibility of plantar pressure mapping in balance assessment through a healthy human subject study. We used an in-house plantar pressure mapping device with high precision based on Frustrated Total Internal Reflection to measure subjects sway during the Romberg test. Through the measurements obtained from all subjects, we measured the minimum spatial resolution required for plantar pressure mapping devices in assessment of balance. We conclude that most of the current devices in the market lack the requirements for imbalance measurements.</description>
