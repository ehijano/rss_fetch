      <title>The X-ray Luminous Type Ibn SN 2022ablq: Estimates of Pre-explosion Mass Loss and Constraints on Precursor Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are rare stellar explosions powered primarily by interaction between the SN ejecta and H-poor, He-rich material lost by their progenitor stars. Multi-wavelength observations, particularly in the X-rays, of SNe Ibn constrain their poorly-understood progenitor channels and mass-loss mechanisms. Here we present Swift X-ray, ultraviolet, and ground-based optical observations of the Type Ibn SN 2022ablq -- only the second SN Ibn with X-ray detections to date. While similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc in the optical, SN 2022ablq is roughly an order of magnitude more luminous in the X-rays, reaching unabsorbed luminosities $L_X$ $\sim$ 3$\times$10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ between 0.2 - 10 keV. From these X-ray observations we infer time-varying mass-loss rates between 0.05 - 0.5 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ peaking 0.5 - 2 yr before explosion. This complex mass-loss history and circumstellar environment disfavor steady-state winds as the primary progenitor mass-loss mechanism. We also search for precursor emission from alternative mass-loss mechanisms, such as eruptive outbursts, in forced photometry during the two years before explosion. We find no statistically significant detections brighter than M $\approx$ -14 -- too shallow to rule out precursor events similar to those observed for other SNe Ibn. Finally, numerical models of the explosion of a $\sim$15 $M_\odot$ helium star that undergoes an eruptive outburst $\approx$1.8 years before explosion are consistent with the observed bolometric light curve. We conclude that our observations disfavor a Wolf-Rayet star progenitor losing He-rich material via stellar winds and instead favor lower-mass progenitor models, including Roche-lobe overflow in helium stars with compact binary companions or stars that undergo eruptive outbursts during late-stage nucleosynthesis stages.</description>

      <title>Long-term radio monitoring of the fast X-ray transient EP240315a: evidence for a relativistic jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent launch of Einstein Probe (EP) in early 2024 opened up a new window onto the transient X-ray sky, allowing for real-time discovery and follow-up of fast X-ray transients (FXRTs). Multi-wavelength observations of FXRTs and their counterparts are key to characterize the properties of their outflows and, ultimately, identify their progenitors. Here, we report our long-term radio monitoring of EP240315A, a long-lasting ($\sim 1000$ s) high redshift ($z=4.9$) FXRT associated to GRB~240315C. Our campaign, carried out with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), followed the transient's evolution at two different frequencies (5.5 GHz and 9~GHz) for three months. In the radio lightcurves we identify an unusual steep rise at 9 GHz, possibly due to a refreshed reverse shock, and a late-time rapid decay of the radio flux, which we interpret as a jet break due to the outflow collimation. We find that the multi-wavelength counterpart of EP240315A is well described by a model of relativistic jet seen close to its axis, with jet half-opening angle $\theta_j \approx 3 ^{\circ}$ and beaming-corrected total energy $E \simeq 4\times 10^{51}$~erg, typical of GRBs. These results show that a substantial fraction of FXRTs may be associated to standard GRBs and that sensitive X-ray monitors, such as Einstein Probe and the proposed HiZ-GUNDAM and Theseus missions, can successfully pinpoint their relativistic outflows up to high-redshifts.</description>

      <title>The FeK$\alpha$ Compton shoulder in accreting Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reprocessed X-ray radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGN) carries important information about the properties of the circumnuclear material around the black hole. The X-ray photons travel from the very center of the system and interact with that material often producing strong emission lines. The FeK$\alpha$ Compton shoulder is formed by fluorescent FeK$\alpha$ photons that perform Compton scatterings with the intercepting material and lose energy to form the distinct shoulder shape. In this work we use the ray-tracing code RefleX to explore how the physical properties of the medium, as well as its geometry, affect the shape of the Compton shoulder (CS). We start by running simulations using a simple toroidal reflector, to test the effect of the metal composition, metallicity, column density, dust presence and velocity on the FeK$\alpha$ line and its Compton shoulder. We confirm that the shape of the Compton shoulder is sensitive to the optical depth of the intercepting medium, which can be regulated by either changing the metal composition or the line of sight column density of the circumnuclear material. Next, we create a series of models, which feature different geometrical configurations of dust and gas, and explore how the Compton shoulder is affected by such configurations finding that components that can regulate the line-of-sight column density affect the FeK$\alpha$ and its CS. Finally, we test whether observatories such as the recently launched XRISM and future Athena will make the Compton shoulder a useful spectral feature of nearby AGN, by applying specific models on simulated spectra of the Circinus galaxy. The CS has the potential to be used to help constrain properties of the circumnuclear material yet with some limitations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the parameters of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter obtained with SRG/ART-XC observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present new constraints on velocity-independent cross section of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter particles obtained with SRG/ART-XC after 4 full-sky surveys. These constraints are derived from observations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph) galaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The constraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among all available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle masses from 4 to 15 keV.</description>

      <title>Mapping the distribution of the magnetic field strength along the NGC 315 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetic field strengths along the jet in NGC~315. First, we estimated the angular velocity of rotation in the jet magnetosphere by comparing the measured velocity profile of NGC~315 with the magneto-hydrodynamic jet model of proposed by Tomimatsu and Takahashi. Similar to the case of M87, we find that the model can reproduce the logarithmic feature of the velocity profile and suggest a slowly rotating black hole magnetosphere for NGC~315. By substituting the estimated $\Omega_{F}$ into the jet power predicted by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, we estimate the magnetic field strength near the event horizon of the central black hole as $5\times 10^{3}~{\rm G}\lesssim B_{H}\lesssim 2\times 10^{4}~{\rm G}$. We then estimate magnetic-field strengths along the jet by comparing the spectral index distribution obtained from VLBI observations with a synchrotron-emitting jet model. Then we constrain the magnetic field strength at a de-projected distance $z$ from the black hole to be in the range $0.06~{\rm G}\lesssim B(z)\lesssim 0.9~{\rm G}$ for $5.2 \times 10^{3}~r_{g}\lesssim z \lesssim 4.9 \times 10^{4}~r_{g}$, where $r_{g}$ represents the gravitational radius. By combining the obtained field strengths at the event horizon and the downstream section of the jet, we find that the accretion flow at the jet base is consistent with a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). We discuss a comparison of the jet power and the magnetic flux anchored to the event horizon in NGC~315 and M87.</description>

      <title>First deep X-ray observations of the Fermi-detected steep-spectrum source and radio-loud NLS1 galaxy 3C 286</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known calibrator source in radio astronomy, 3C 286 ($z=0.85$), is a compact steep-spectrum (CSS) radio source and spectroscopically classified as a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy. It is also known for its damped Ly$\alpha$ system from an intervening galaxy at $z=0.692$ detected in both ultraviolet (UV) and radio spectra. In addition, despite being a misaligned active galactic nuclei (AGN), 3C 286 is also detected in $\gamma$-rays by Fermi. Thus, this unique object combines the characteristics of CSS sources, NLS1 galaxies, and $\gamma$-ray emitters with misaligned jets, providing an excellent laboratory for extending our knowledge of AGN disk-jet coupling. Despite its significance, 3C 286 has been rarely observed in X-rays. In this study, we present our deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of 3C 286. The results reveal that the X-ray spectrum can be well described by models including an intervening absorber with redshift and column density consistent with previous UV and radio observations. The most important finding is that the spectrum cannot be described by a single power law, but a soft excess is required which is parameterized by a blackbody. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting the presence of off-nuclear X-ray emission at a radius that corresponds to the location of the radio lobes. While further theoretical work is still needed, our findings offer new clues to understand the specific mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission from this unique object.</description>

      <title>Accretion properties of soft X-ray transient XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray transients are a subclass of the low mass X-ray binaries that occasionally show a sudden rise in their soft X-ray luminosity; otherwise, they remain in an extremely faint state. We investigate the accretion properties of the soft X-ray transient XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 outburst obtained by NICER and NuSTAR data in July. We present detailed results on the timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray emission during the outburst. The power spectral density shows no quasi-periodic oscillation features. The source's spectrum on July 19 can be well-fitted with a multi-color blackbody component, a power-law component, and a reflection component with a broadened iron emission line. NICER spectra can be well-fitted by considering a combination of a blackbody and a power-law. The source exhibits a transition within just five days from a soft state to an intermediate state during the outburst decline phase. The inner accretion disk has a low inclination angle ($\sim18^\circ$). The spectral analysis also suggests a high-spin ($a&gt;0.9$) BH as the central accreting object.</description>

Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has made breakthrough discoveries in gravitational-wave astronomy, a new field of astronomy that provides a different means of observing our Universe. Gravitational-wave discoveries are possible thanks to the work of thousands of people from across the globe working together. In this article, we discuss the range of engagement activities used to communicate LVK gravitational-wave discoveries and the stories of the people behind the science using the activities surrounding the release of the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog as a case study.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Postglitch Dynamics in Neutron Stars Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a glitch, a neutron star interior undergoes a transfer of angular momentum from the star's crust to the core, resulting in the spin-up of the latter. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. While the complexity of the problem has hindered studies of the mechanisms' combined action, analytical work on individual processes suggests different spin-up timescales depending on the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, and the magnetic field, respectively. However, experimental and numerical validations of these results are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction and conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall$-$Vinen$-$Bekarevich$-$Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Catalog of outbursts of neutron star LMXBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many X-ray binaries are transiently accreting. Having statistics on their recurrence times is helpful to address questions related to binary evolution and populations, as well as the physics of binary systems. We compile a catalog of known outbursts of neutron star (identified through bursts or pulsations) low-mass X-ray binaries, until late 2023. Most outbursts are taken from the literature, but we also identify some outbursts from public X-ray monitoring lightcurves. We find 109 outbursts not previously identified in the literature; most are from the frequent transients GRS 1747-312 and the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335, though we suspect that two outbursts from Liller 1 may be from another transient, besides the Rapid Burster. We also find new outbursts for 10 other systems, and verify substantial quiescent intervals for XMM J174457-2850.3, XMMU J174716.1-281048, and AX J1754.2-2754. Outburst detection has been relatively efficient since 1996 for outbursts above $F_X$(2-10)$=3\times10^{-10}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. While several systems have many known outbursts, 40 of the 85 systems we track have zero or one recorded outburst between 1996 and 2023. This suggests that faint Galactic Center X-ray binaries may be neutron star X-ray binaries, though we cannot completely rule out the proposition that most neutron star X-ray binaries undergo frequent outbursts below all-sky monitor detection limits.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>Photon-likeness of hadron showers and impact of Lorentz boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the probability of proton-induced air showers at $E&gt;10$\,EeV being misidentified as photon-induced due to neutral pions receiving a major part of the primary energy in the first interaction, thereby enhancing the electromagnetic shower component by their $\pi^0 \to \gamma \gamma$ decay. Using CORSIKA simulations, we demonstrate the relevance of this effect at EeV energies. However, the probability for such photon-like events drops down strongly at the highest energies due to the increasing probability of Lorentz boosted $\pi^0$'s suffering hadronic interactions before decay. Different hadronic interaction models suggest that photon-like hadronic events may be observed at current UHECR observatories. A quantitative comparison of the observed number of background events found in recent photon searches published by the Pierre Auger Collaboration allows us conclude that the hypothesis of upwards fluctuations of $\pi^0$-production alone is insufficient to explain the data.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description of hadronic matter from a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microscopic nuclear matter formalism with explicit chiral symmetry based on the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model is considered to describe nuclear matter. To reproduce nuclear matter properties adequately at the saturation density, four-point and eight-point interactions are introduced. Within a Bayesian inference approach, the parameters of the model are determined by imposing nuclear matter, both experimental and from {\it ab-initio} calculations, and neutron star observational constraints. Nuclear matter properties are well reproduced with an effective mass of 0.75 to 0.8 nucleon mass at the saturation density. At 90% confidence level, the radius of a $1.4 ~\rm M_\odot$ star varies between 11.48 km and 13.20 km, masses as large as $\sim 2.2 ~\rm M_\odot$ are predicted and the radius of a 2 M$_\odot$ star is above 10.5 km. High-density perturbative QCD (pQCD) results exclude equations of state that predict larger maximum masses and radii. The speed of sound increases monotonically with density and reaches values as large as $\sqrt{0.7}c$-$\sqrt{0.8}c$ in the center of massive stars. Several properties such as the polytropic index or the renormalized trace anomaly, that have been proposed to identify the deconfined phase transition, are analyzed. Interestingly, the radius of the obtained posterior that also meets pQCD constraints aligns closely with the mass-radius measurement of the recent PSR J0437-4715, which contrasts with other relativistic mean field model results.</description>

      <title>GERry: A Code to Optimise the Hunt for the Electromagnetic Counter-parts to Gravitational Wave Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events has been rapidly gathering pace in recent years thanks to the increasing number and capabilities of both gravitational wave detectors and wide field survey telescopes. Difficulties remain, however, in detecting these counterparts due to their inherent scarcity, faintness and rapidly evolving nature. To find these counterparts, it is important that one optimises the observing strategy for their recovery. This can be difficult due to the large number of potential variables at play. Such follow-up campaigns are also capable of detecting hundreds or potentially thousands of unrelated transients, particularly for GW events with poor localisation. Even if the observations are capable of detecting a counterpart, finding it among the numerous contaminants can prove challenging. Here we present the Gravitational wave Electromagnetic RecovRY code (GERry) to perform detailed analysis and survey-agnostic quantification of observing campaigns attempting to recover electromagnetic counterparts. GERry considers the campaign's spatial, temporal and wavelength coverage, in addition to Galactic extinction and the expected counterpart light curve evolution from the GW 3D localisation volume. It returns quantified statistics that can be used to: determine the probability of having detected the counterpart, identify the most promising sources, and assess and refine strategy. Here we demonstrate the code to look at the performance and parameter space probed by current and upcoming wide-field surveys such as GOTO &amp; VRO.</description>

      <title>Influence of effective nucleon mass on equation of state for supernova simulations and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of effective nucleon mass on the equation of state (EOS), which is constructed for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers, within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a modification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger effective mass ratio ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.8$) compared to the TM1e model ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.63$), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This EOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of effective nucleon mass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the saturation density. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the TM1m model, are compared with those of the TM1e and original TM1 models. Both the TM1m and TM1e models are found to be compatible with the latest constraints on tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, derived from astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>The comparison of an optical and X-ray counterpart of subparsec supermassive binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study and compare the optical and X-ray counterparts of subparsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). With that aim, we simulated the profiles of optical spectral lines emitted from the broad line region (BLR) as well as X-ray spectral lines emitted from the relativistic accretion disks around both black holes and compared them with each other. The obtained results showed that SMBHBs could cause a specific, but different variability of the lines from the optical part and Fe K$\alpha$ line, leaving potentially detectable imprints in their profiles. Since these imprints depend on the orbital phase of the system, they could be used for reconstructing the Keplerian orbits of the components in the observed SMBHBs. Moreover, such signatures in the optical and X-ray line profiles of the observed SMBHBs could be used as a tool for the detection of these objects as well as for studying their properties.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with pions in the neutrino-trapped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work [B. Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown that the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and transport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new reaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their impact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped regime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find that the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by modifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction pathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak at temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of tens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the bulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the bulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller than its peak value.</description>

      <title>Search for sub-TeV Neutrino Emission from Novae with IceCube-DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The understanding of novae, the thermonuclear eruptions on the surfaces of white dwarf stars in binaries, has recently undergone a major paradigm shift. Though the bolometric luminosity of novae was long thought to arise directly from photons supplied by the thermonuclear runaway, recent GeV gamma-ray observations have supported the notion that a significant portion of the luminosity could come from radiative shocks. More recently, observations of novae have lent evidence that these shocks are acceleration sites for hadrons for at least some types of novae. In this scenario, a flux of neutrinos may accompany the observed gamma rays. As the gamma rays from most novae have only been observed up to a few GeV, novae have previously not been considered as targets for neutrino telescopes, which are most sensitive at and above TeV energies. Here, we present the first search for neutrinos from novae with energies between a few GeV and 10 TeV using IceCube-DeepCore, a densely instrumented region of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with a reduced energy threshold. We search both for a correlation between gamma-ray and neutrino emission as well as between optical and neutrino emission from novae. We find no evidence for neutrino emission from the novae considered in this analysis and set upper limits for all gamma-ray detected novae.</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory Open Data</title>

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Collaboration has embraced the concept of open access to their research data since its foundation, with the aim of giving access to the widest possible community. A gradual process of release began as early as 2007 when 1% of the cosmic-ray data was made public, along with 100% of the space-weather information. In February 2021, a portal was released containing 10% of cosmic-ray data collected from 2004 to 2018, during Phase I of the Observatory. The Portal included detailed documentation about the detection and reconstruction procedures, analysis codes that can be easily used and modified and, additionally, visualization tools. Since then the Portal has been updated and extended. In 2023, a catalog of the 100 highest-energy cosmic-ray events examined in depth has been included. A specific section dedicated to educational use has been developed with the expectation that these data will be explored by a wide and diverse community including professional and citizen-scientists, and used for educational and outreach initiatives. This paper describes the context, the spirit and the technical implementation of the release of data by the largest cosmic-ray detector ever built, and anticipates its future developments.</description>

Abstract: The two most favored explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) are millisecond pulsars and self annihilation of the smooth dark matter halo of the galaxy. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we would like to optimally use all information in the available data, including photon direction and energy information. To date, analyses of the GCE have generally treated directional and energy information separately, or have ignored one or the other completely. Here, we develop a method for analyzing the GCE that relies on simulation-based inference with neural posterior models to jointly analyze photon directional and spectral information while correctly accounting for the spatial and energy resolution of the telescope, here assumed to be the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our results also have implications for analyses of the diffuse gamma-ray background, which we discuss.</description>

      <title>Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of The Milky Way Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.</description>

      <title>Resolution analysis of magnetically arrested disk simulations</title>

Abstract: Polarisation measurements by the Event Horizon Telescope from M87$^{\ast}$ and Sgr A$^\ast$ suggest that there is a dynamically strong, ordered magnetic field, typical of what is expected of a magnetically arrested accretion disk (MAD). In such disks the strong poloidal magnetic field can suppress the accretion flow and cause episodic flux eruptions. Recent work shows that General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) MAD simulations feature dynamics of turbulence and mixing instabilities that are becoming resolved at higher resolutions. We perform a convergence study of MAD states exceeding the status quo by an order of magnitude in resolution. We use existing 3D simulations performed with the H-AMR code, up to resolution of 5376 x 2304 x 2304 in a logarithmic spherical-polar grid. We find consistent time-averaged disk properties across all resolutions. However, higher resolutions reveal signs of inward angular momentum transport attributed to turbulent convection, particularly evident when mixing instabilities occur at the surfaces of flux tubes during flux eruptions. Additionally, we see wave-like features in the jet sheath, which become more prominent at higher resolutions, that may induce mixing between jet and disk. At higher resolutions, we observe the sheath to be thinner, resulting in increased temperature, reduced magnetisation, and greater variability. Those differences could affect the dissipation of energy, that would eventually result in distinct observable radiative emission from high-resolution simulations. With higher resolutions, we can delve into crucial questions about horizon-scale physics and its impact on the dynamics and emission properties of larger-scale jets.</description>

      <title>X-ray view of Dissipative Warm Corona in AGN</title>

Abstract: In the X-ray spectra of AGNs, a noticeable excess of soft X-rays is typically detected beyond the extrapolation of the power-law trend observed between 2-10 keV. In the scenario of warm Comptonization, observations propose a warm corona temperature ranging from 0.1-1 keV and an optical depth of approximately 10-20. Furthermore, according to radiative constraints derived from spectral analyses employing Comptonization models, it is suggested that the majority of the accretion power is released within the warm corona, while the disk beneath it is largely non-dissipative, emitting mainly the reprocessed radiation from the corona. We test the dissipative warm corona model using the radiative transfer code-TITAN/NOAR on a sample of 82 XMM-Newton observations of AGNs. Through spectral modeling of the X-ray data, we aim to estimate the total amount of internal heating inside the warm corona situated on top of the accretion disk. By modeling the 0.3-10 keV EPIC-pn spectra, we estimate the internal heating and optical depth of the warm corona and check their correlations with global parameters blackhole parameters. From model normalization, we compute the radial extent of warm corona on top of cold accretion disk. Our model infers the presence of dissipative warm corona, with optical depths distributed in the range 6-30 and total internal heating in the range 1-29 x 1e-23 erg/s-cm3. The extent of warm corona is spread across a large range from 7-408 gravitational radii, and we find that warm corona is more extended for larger accretion rates. Soft excess emission is ubiquitous in AGNs across wide mass range and accretion rate. We confirm that warm corona responsible for producing the soft-excess is highly dissipative in nature with larger optical depths being associated with lower internal heating and vice versa. The cold standard accretion disk regulates the extent of warm corona.</description>

      <title>Superradiant clouds may be relevant for close compact object binaries</title>

Abstract: Bosonic fields (within suitable mass range) may be collectively generated by rotating black holes through the black hole superradiance process. The resulting black hole is surrounded by a ``cloud" of particles whose wave function populates the superradiant energy level of the black hole. For comparable mass ratio binary black hole systems, it has been suggested that these clouds often deplete at large binary separations because of level mixing effects. As a result, these clouds may not be dynamically relevant for black hole and neutron star binaries that enter the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and LISA detection frequency band. In this work, we point out that the common envelope process during a compact binary evolution may bring the binary to $\sim 0.01$AU in hundreds to thousands of years, so that depletion caused by certain level mixings are no longer important. We derive a relevant regime of binary parameters where the clouds are still present for binary entering the LISA band, and show that common envelop process does enlarge such parameter regime. When the binary separation further decreases due to gravitational wave radiation, we discuss the impact of possible cloud mass transfer between the binary objects.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal Catastrophe in Resonant Self-interacting Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowskian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Coherent collision integrals for neutrino transport equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos and derive Feynman rules for computing scattering rates involving coherent states. Our rules encompass both flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the scattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease as with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for computing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently mixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples, including some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in supernovae.</description>
