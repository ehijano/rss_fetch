      <title>The art of connections: constructing a social network from the correspondence archive of Sybren Valkema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network analysis allows researchers to discover insights from connections between people. While the process of building a social network is relatively straightforward for contemporary social media, deriving connections from historical archives remains a challenging task, with every data collection presenting its unique challenges. Our contribution focuses on building and analysing a social network from the correspondence archive of Sybren Valkema (1916-1996), a Dutch glass artist and educator. The archive contains both typewritten and handwritten documents in multiple languages, and includes letters from glass artists, art students, art collectors and other agents. We develop an automatic pipeline approach which includes separating handwritten and typed documents, performing text recognition specific to the document modality, extracting names of people from text using named entity recognition, de-duplicating the resulting names to create actor nodes, classifying the actors using entity linking, and, finally, connecting them together and analysing the resulting network. Every part of the pipeline is evaluated against a manual analysis performed by an art historian on a subset of the data collection in order to find out which pitfalls of the automatic approach need to be resolved in future work and, on the contrary, whether using the automatic approach allows to discover any additional insights. The results show strong performance in discovering sender-receiver connections as well as additional meaningful connections in text, with the main challenge being text recognition on scanned pages.</description>

      <title>Dating ancient manuscripts using radiocarbon and AI-based writing style analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the chronology of ancient handwritten manuscripts is essential for reconstructing the evolution of ideas. For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date-prediction model, trained on the basis of new radiocarbon-dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the radiocarbon-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the radiocarbon dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79 per cent of the samples were considered 'realistic' upon palaeographic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The radiocarbon ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granularity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.</description>
