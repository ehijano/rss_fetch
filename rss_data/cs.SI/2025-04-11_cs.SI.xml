      <title>Echoes of Disagreement: Measuring Disparity in Social Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public discourse and opinions stem from multiple social groups. Each group has beliefs about a topic (such as vaccination, abortion, gay marriage, etc.), and opinions are exchanged and blended to produce consensus. A particular measure of interest corresponds to measuring the influence of each group on the consensus and the disparity between groups on the extent to which they influence the consensus. In this paper, we study and give provable algorithms for optimizing the disparity under the DeGroot or the Friedkin-Johnsen models of opinion dynamics. Our findings provide simple poly-time algorithms to optimize disparity for most cases, fully characterize the instances that optimize disparity, and show how simple interventions such as contracting vertices or adding links affect disparity. Finally, we test our developed algorithms in a variety of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics and the unpredictability of opinion trajectories in an adaptive social network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding opinion dynamics in social networks is critical for predicting social behavior and detecting polarization. Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</description>

      <title>FLASH: Flexible Learning of Adaptive Sampling from History in Temporal Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregating temporal signals from historic interactions is a key step in future link prediction on dynamic graphs. However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive. Hence, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) often rely on historical neighbors sampling heuristics such as uniform sampling or recent neighbors selection. These heuristics are static and fail to adapt to the underlying graph structure. We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements for TGNNs equipped with FLASH.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>New centrality measure: ksi-centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new centrality measures, called ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality measure the importance of a node up to the importance of its neighbors. First, we show that normalized ksi-centrality can be rewritten in terms of the Laplacian matrix such that its expression is similar to the local clustering coefficient. After that we introduce average normalized ksi-coefficient and show that for a random Erdos-Renyi graph it is almost the same as average clustering coefficient. It also shows behavior similar to the clustering coefficient for the Windmill and Wheel graphs. Finally, we show that the distributions of ksi centrality and normalized ksi centrality distinguish networks based on real data from artificial networks, including the Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert and Boccaletti-Hwang-Latora small-world networks. Furthermore, we show the relationship between normalized ksi centrality and the average normalized ksi coefficient and the algebraic connectivity of the graph and the Chegeer number.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Simulation on Large Language Models for Decision-Making in Political Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning, their ability to simulate human decision-making -- particularly in political contexts -- remains an open question. However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Attributes and Multi-Scale Structures for Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</description>
