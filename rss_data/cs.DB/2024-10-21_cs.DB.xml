      <title>Attribute-Based Semantic Type Detection and Data Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliance on data-driven decision-making across sectors highlights the critical need for high-quality data; despite advancements, data quality issues persist, significantly impacting business strategies and scientific research. Current data quality methods fail to leverage the semantic richness embedded in words inside attribute labels (or column names/headers in tables) across diverse datasets and domains, leaving a crucial gap in comprehensive data quality evaluation. This research addresses this gap by introducing an innovative methodology centered around Attribute-Based Semantic Type Detection and Data Quality Assessment. By leveraging semantic information within attribute labels, combined with rule-based analysis and comprehensive Formats and Abbreviations dictionaries, our approach introduces a practical semantic type classification system comprising approximately 23 types, including numerical non-negative, categorical, ID, names, strings, geographical, temporal, and complex formats like URLs, IP addresses, email, and binary values plus several numerical bounded types, such as age and percentage. A comparative analysis with Sherlock, a state-of-the-art Semantic Type Detection system, shows the advantages of our approach in terms of classification robustness and applicability to data quality assessment tasks. Our research focuses on well-known data quality issues and their corresponding data quality dimension violations, grounding our methodology in a robust academic framework. Detailed analysis of fifty distinct datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository showcases our method's proficiency in identifying potential data quality issues. Compared to established tools like YData Profiling, our method exhibits superior accuracy, detecting 81 missing values across 922 attributes where YData identified only one.</description>

      <title>Data Cleaning Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data cleaning is a crucial yet challenging task in data analysis, often requiring significant manual effort. To automate data cleaning, previous systems have relied on statistical rules derived from erroneous data, resulting in low accuracy and recall. This work introduces Cocoon, a novel data cleaning system that leverages large language models for rules based on semantic understanding and combines them with statistical error detection. However, data cleaning is still too complex a task for current LLMs to handle in one shot. To address this, we introduce Cocoon, which decomposes complex cleaning tasks into manageable components in a workflow that mimics human cleaning processes. Our experiments show that Cocoon outperforms state-of-the-art data cleaning systems on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking State Management in Actor Systems for Cloud-Native Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The actor model has gained increasing popularity. However, it lacks support for complex state management tasks, such as enforcing foreign key constraints and ensuring data replication consistency across actors. These are crucial properties in partitioned application designs, such as microservices. To fill this gap, we start by analyzing the key impediments in state-of-the-art actor systems. We find it difficult for developers to express complex data relationships across actors and reason about the impact of state updates on performance due to opaque state management abstractions.
  To solve this conundrum, we develop SmSa, a novel data management layer for actor systems, allowing developers to declare data dependencies that cut across actors, including foreign keys, data replications, and other dependencies. SmSa can transparently enforce the declared dependencies, reducing the burden on developers. Furthermore, SmSa employs novel logging and concurrency control algorithms to support transactional maintenance of data dependencies.
  We demonstrate SmSa can support core data management tasks where dependencies across components appear frequently without jeopardizing application logic expressiveness and performance. Our experiments show SmSa significantly reduces the logging overhead and leads to increased concurrency level, improving by up to 2X the performance of state-of-the-art deterministic scheduling approaches. As a result, SmSa will make it easier to design and implement highly partitioned and distributed applications.</description>

      <title>Learning SQL from within: integrating database exercises into the database itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SQL adventure builder (SQLab) is an open-source framework for creating SQL games that are embedded within the very database they query. Students' answers are evaluated using query fingerprinting, a novel technique that allows for better feedback than traditional SQL online judge systems. Fingerprints act as tokens that are used to unlock messages encrypted in an isolated auxiliary table. These messages may include hints, answer keys, examples, explanations, or narrative elements. They can also contain the problem statement of the next task, which turns them into nodes in a virtual DAG with queries as edges. This makes it possible to design a coherent adventure with a storyline of arbitrary complexity.
  This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings of SQLab's query fingerprinting model, its implementation challenges, and its potential to improve SQL education through game-based learning. The underlying concepts are fully cross-vendor, and support for SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL is already available. As a proof of concept, two games, 30 exercises and one mock exam were tested over a three-year period with about 300 students.</description>

      <title>The Computational Anatomy of Humility: Modeling Intellectual Humility in Online Public Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability for individuals to constructively engage with one another across lines of difference is a critical feature of a healthy pluralistic society. This is also true in online discussion spaces like social media platforms. To date, much social media research has focused on preventing ills -- like political polarization and the spread of misinformation. While this is important, enhancing the quality of online public discourse requires not just reducing ills but also promoting foundational human virtues. In this study, we focus on one particular virtue: ``intellectual humility'' (IH), or acknowledging the potential limitations in one's own beliefs. Specifically, we explore the development of computational methods for measuring IH at scale. We manually curate and validate an IH codebook on 350 posts about religion drawn from subreddits and use them to develop LLM-based models for automating this measurement. Our best model achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.64 across labels (and 0.70 when predicting IH/IA/Neutral at the coarse level), higher than an expected naive baseline of 0.51 (0.32 for IH/IA/Neutral) but lower than a human annotator-informed upper bound of 0.85 (0.83 for IH/IA/Neutral). Our results both highlight the challenging nature of detecting IH online -- opening the door to new directions in NLP research -- and also lay a foundation for computational social science researchers interested in analyzing and fostering more IH in online public discourse.</description>

      <title>Real-time Event Joining in Practice With Kafka and Flink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, machine learning training pipelines have predominantly relied on batch training models, retraining models every few hours. However, industrial practitioners have proved that real-time training can lead to a more adaptive and personalized user experience. The transition from batch to real-time is full of tradeoffs to get the benefits of accuracy and freshness while keeping the costs low and having a predictable, maintainable system.
  Our work characterizes migrating to a streaming pipeline for a machine learning model using Apache Kafka and Flink. We demonstrate how to transition from Google Pub/Sub to Kafka to handle incoming real-time events and leverage Flink for streaming joins using RocksDB and checkpointing. We also address challenges such as managing causal dependencies between events, balancing event time versus processing time, and ensuring exactly-once versus at-least-once delivery guarantees, among other issues. Furthermore, we showcase how we improved scalability by using topic partitioning in Kafka, reduced event throughput by \textbf{85\%} through the use of Avro schema and compression, decreased costs by \textbf{40\%}, and implemented a separate pipeline to ensure data correctness. Our findings provide valuable insights into the tradeoffs and complexities of real-time systems, enabling better-informed decisions tailored to specific requirements for building effective streaming systems that enhance user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Materials: Leveraging Language Models for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the predictive capabilities of language models in material science is an ongoing interest. This study investigates the application of language model embeddings to enhance material property prediction in materials science. By evaluating various contextual embedding methods and pre-trained models, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), we demonstrate that domain-specific models, particularly MatBERT significantly outperform general-purpose models in extracting implicit knowledge from compound names and material properties. Our findings reveal that information-dense embeddings from the third layer of MatBERT, combined with a context-averaging approach, offer the most effective method for capturing material-property relationships from the scientific literature. We also identify a crucial "tokenizer effect," highlighting the importance of specialized text processing techniques that preserve complete compound names while maintaining consistent token counts. These insights underscore the value of domain-specific training and tokenization in materials science applications and offer a promising pathway for accelerating the discovery and development of new materials through AI-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Learned Indexes with Distribution Smoothing via Virtual Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on learned indexes has created a new perspective for indexes as models that map keys to their respective storage locations. These learned indexes are created to approximate the cumulative distribution function of the key set, where using only a single model may have limited accuracy. To overcome this limitation, a typical method is to use multiple models, arranged in a hierarchical manner, where the query performance depends on two aspects: (i) traversal time to find the correct model and (ii) search time to find the key in the selected model. Such a method may cause some key space regions that are difficult to model to be placed at deeper levels in the hierarchy. To address this issue, we propose an alternative method that modifies the key space as opposed to any structural or model modifications. This is achieved through making the key set more learnable (i.e., smoothing the distribution) by inserting virtual points. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm named CSV to integrate our virtual point insertion method into existing learned indexes, reducing both their traversal and search time. We implement CSV on state-of-the-art learned indexes and evaluate them on real-world datasets. Extensive experimental results show significant query performance improvement for the keys in deeper levels of the index structures at a low storage cost.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Correlation-Aware Table Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of data lakes for managing relational data necessitates efficient, open storage formats that provide high scan performance and competitive compression ratios. While existing formats achieve fast scans through lightweight encoding techniques, they have reached a plateau in terms of minimizing storage footprint. Recently, correlation-aware compression schemes have been shown to reduce file sizes further. Yet, current approaches either incur significant scan overheads or require manual specification of correlations, limiting their practicability. We present $\texttt{Virtual}$, a framework that integrates seamlessly with existing open formats to automatically leverage data correlations, achieving substantial compression gains while having minimal scan performance overhead. Experiments on data-gov datasets show that $\texttt{Virtual}$ reduces file sizes by up to 40% compared to Apache Parquet.</description>

      <title>QUIS: Question-guided Insights Generation for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering meaningful insights from a large dataset, known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), is a challenging task that requires thorough exploration and analysis of the data. Automated Data Exploration (ADE) systems use goal-oriented methods with Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning towards full automation. However, these methods require human involvement to anticipate goals that may limit insight extraction, while fully automated systems demand significant computational resources and retraining for new datasets. We introduce QUIS, a fully automated EDA system that operates in two stages: insight generation (ISGen) driven by question generation (QUGen). The QUGen module generates questions in iterations, refining them from previous iterations to enhance coverage without human intervention or manually curated examples. The ISGen module analyzes data to produce multiple relevant insights in response to each question, requiring no prior training and enabling QUIS to adapt to new datasets.</description>
