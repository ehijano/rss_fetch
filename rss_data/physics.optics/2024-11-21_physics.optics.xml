      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Models in Scattering Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy for High Spatial Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) is a technique to enhance the spatial resolution, and when combined by Fourier transform spectroscopy it can provide spectroscopic information with high spatial resolution. This paper studies two analytical models for the s-SNOM probe using atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and its interaction with a dielectric material. We evaluate the validity of these models by retrieving the permittivity spectrum of a sample material through an inverse method.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optics in 2D materials: from classical to quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonic technology, enabling a wide array of applications, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Study of Group III-V Waveguides on Sapphire Platform for Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have been acknowledged as the promising platforms for the applications in data communication, Lidar in autonomous driving vehicles, innovative sensor technology, etc. Since the demonstration of optical components individually, integration of both electronics and photonics for functional devices on a common platform has been a key technology driver enhancing the stability and scalability of integrated photonic technologies. Recently, we proposed to use sapphire as a high-performance PIC platform, which enables a fully integrated solution to include a complete set of components with light source, modulator, light detection, passive devices, silicon on sapphire control circuit all-in-one sapphire platform to achieve high-performance low-cost mixed-signal optical links. In parallel to developing ac-tive components such as group III-V lasers on sapphire, in this work, the performance of group III-V straight waveguides on sapphire was systemically studied. The refractive indices contrast between GaAs, InP, GaSb, and sapphire are sufficiently high to achieve low loss over a broad optical wavelength. The calculated loss at wavelengths of 1330 nm, 1550 nm, and 2000 nm for the GaAs, InP, and GaSb rib waveguides are 0.32 dB/cm, 0.67 dB/cm, and 0.70 dB/cm, re-spectively. Since the fundamental element to construct all passive building blocks is the straight waveguide, results from this work would allow us to assess other basic passive building blocks.</description>

      <title>Active Stabilization of Laser Diode Injection Using a Polarization-Spectroscopy Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser diode injection-locking is a commonly used method to amplify laser light, while preserving its spectral properties. Fluctuations in the environmental conditions can cause injection-locking to fail, especially when operating with low seed powers or with a swept seed frequency. We present a method inspired by the H\"ansch-Couillaud scheme to monitor and actively stabilize the conditions required for injection-locking a laser diode. Using only a few optical components, our scheme can run continuously in the background and is modulation-free. We demonstrate its efficacy by showing its robustness to large fluctuations in diode temperature, seed frequency and power, effectively extending the reliable operating range and stability over time.</description>

      <title>Twisted fibre: a photonic topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breaking and enforcing of symmetries is a crucial ingredient in designing topologically robust materials. While magnetic fields can break time-reversal symmetry to create Chern insulators in electronic and microwave systems, at optical frequencies natural materials cannot respond to magnetic fields, which presents a challenge for the scalable exploitation of topologically enhanced devices. Here, we leverage the natural geometry of fibre to build a scalable photonic Chern insulator by twisting the fibre during fabrication. The twist inside optical fibre breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and induces a pseudo-magnetic field, which we observe via photonic Landau levels. Unavoidably, this twist introduces a competing topology-destroying effect through a parabolic profile in the effective refractive index. Using simulations to guide experimental materials design, we discover the Goldilocks regime where the real-space Chern invariant survives, guaranteeing topological protection against fabrication-induced disorder of any symmetry class.</description>

      <title>Method for overcoming the finite space-bandwidth limitation of digital holograms in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digital hologram has a finite space-bandwidth, which determines the spatial resolution and angular field of view of its reconstructed image. However, a higher space-bandwidth induces aliased replica patterns in the Fresnel diffraction. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of the angular spectrum in an undersampled hologram within the complex domain. The replica functions are identified as higher spatial frequency components of the original function, with the spatial frequency range extending continuously from the original function into the region of the replica functions. Simulations of optical imaging show results consistent with theoretical analysis, demonstrating that imaging performance beyond the space-bandwidth limitation of a digital hologram is achievable. Specifically, a method is proposed to address the challenge of limited viewing angles in holographic displays based on this interpretation. This approach provides an alternative solution to overcome the constraints imposed by the finite space-bandwidth of digital holograms.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian boundary induced hybrid skin-topological effect excited by synthetic complex frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) has recently been proposed as a mechanism where topological edge states collapse into corner states under the influence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). However, directly observing this effect is challenging due to the complex frequencies of eigenmodes. In this study, we experimentally observe HSTE corner states using synthetic complex frequency excitations in a transmission line network. We demonstrate that HSTE induces asymmetric transmission along a specific direction within the topological band gap. Besides HSTE, we identify corner states originating from non-chiral edge states, which are caused by the unbalanced effective onsite energy shifts at the boundaries of the network. Furthermore, our results suggest that whether the bulk interior is Hermitian or non-Hermitian is not a key factor for HSTE. Instead, the HSTE states can be realized and relocated simply by adjusting the non-Hermitian distribution at the boundaries. Our research has deepened the understanding of a range of issues regarding HSTE, paving the way for advancements in the design of non-Hermitian topological devices.</description>

      <title>Simulating Optical Coherent Nonlinear Response for High-Intensity Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculation of the coherent nonlinear response of a system is essential to correctly interpret results from advanced techniques such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS). Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a {\delta}-function in time. We present exact calculations using the phase-cycling method without making the aforementioned approximations. We introduce a generalized version of the phase-cycling method to isolate an arbitrary N-wave mixing signal. We then apply this method to model the saturation of the nonlinear signal from excitons in semiconductor quantum wells, which is consistent with 2DCS experiments. We also present simulation results that replicate previously-reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signal, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Degenerate merging BICs in resonant metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant metasurfaces driven by bound states in the continuum (BIC) offer an intriguing approach to engineer high-Q resonances. Merging multiple BICs in the momentum space could further enhance the Q-factor as well as its robustness to fabrication imperfections. Here, we report doubly-degenerate guided mode resonances (GMR) in a resonant metasurface, whose radiation losses could be totally suppressed due to merging BICs. We show that the GMRs and their associated accidental BICs can be evolved into degenerate merging BICs by parametric tuning of the metasurface. Significantly, these two GMRs share the same critical parameter (i.e. lattice constants or thickness) that the merging BICs occur. Interestingly, thanks to the degenerate property of two GMRs, a larger (smaller) period will split one of merging BICs into eight accidental BICs at off-{\Gamma} point, but annihilate the other. Such exotic phenomenon can be well explained from the interaction of GMRs and background Fabry-Perot resonances. Our result provides new strategies to engineering high-Q resonances in resonant metasurfaces for light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Versatile photonic frequency synthetic dimensions using a single Mach-Zehnder-interferometer-assisted device on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized spectrometer enabled by end-to-end deep learning on large-scale radiative cavity array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized (mini-) spectrometers are highly desirable tools for chemical, biological, and medical diagnostics because of their potential for portable and in situ spectral detection. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a mini-spectrometer that combines a large-scale radiative cavity array with end-to-end deep learning networks. Specifically, we utilize high-Q bound states in continuum cavities with distinct radiation characteristics as the fundamental units to achieve parallel spectral detection. We realize a 36 $\times$ 30 cavity array that spans a wide spectral range from 1525 to 1605 nm with quality factors above 10^4. We further train a deep network with 8000 outputs to directly map arbitrary spectra to array responses excited by the out-of-plane incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mini-spectrometer can resolve unknown spectra with a resolution of 0.048 nm in a bandwidth of 80 nm and fidelity exceeding 95%, thus offering a promising method for compact, high resolution, and broadband spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>An air-spaced virtually imaged phased array with 94 MHz resolution for precision spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an air-spaced virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometer that resolves the modes of a mid-infrared frequency comb with a repetition rate of 250 MHz, without an optical filter cavity. With a record spectral resolution of 94 MHz for VIPA, the spectrometer enables precision molecular spectroscopy with high resolution, broad spectral coverage and fast data acquisition. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer by measuring the absorption spectra of molecular species generated in plasmas. Using plasmas of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, and methane at a low pressure of 1.5 mbar, we obtained high-resolution spectra of methane, around 3017 cm$^{-1}$, as well as hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, around 3240 cm$^{-1}$, demonstrating a wide spectral coverage over 290 cm$^{-1}$ (equivalent to 8.7 THz). The spectrometer performance in terms of Allan-Werle deviation and noise-equivalent absorption is discussed. The air-spaced VIPA concept offers a compact and practical spectrometer that harnesses the full potential of a stabilized frequency comb, making it suitable for a wide range of high-precision spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation with Telecom Photons from Remote Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for a global quantum internet is based on the realization of a scalable network which requires quantum hardware with exceptional performance. Among them are quantum light sources providing deterministic, high brightness, high-fidelity entangled photons and quantum memories with coherence times in the millisecond range and above. To operate the network on a global scale, the quantum light source should emit at telecommunication wavelengths with minimum propagation losses. A cornerstone for the operation of such a quantum network is the demonstration of quantum teleportation. Here we realize full-photonic quantum teleportation employing one of the most promising platforms, i.e. semiconductor quantum dots, which can fulfill all the aforementioned requirements. Two remote quantum dots are used, one as a source of entangled photon pairs and the other as a single-photon source. The frequency mismatch between the triggered sources is erased using two polarization-preserving quantum frequency converters, enabling a Bell state measurement at telecommunication wavelengths. A post-selected teleportation fidelity of up to 0.721(33) is achieved, significantly above the classical limit, demonstrating successful quantum teleportation between light generated by distinct sources. These results mark a major advance for the semiconductor platform as a source of quantum light fulfilling a key requirement for a scalable quantum network. This becomes particularly relevant after the seminal breakthrough of addressing a nuclear spin in semiconductor quantum dots demonstrating long coherence times, thus fulfilling another crucial step towards a scalable quantum network.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Thermal Fluctuations on Bosonic Correlations and the AC Stark Effect in Two-Level Atoms: A Superstatistical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the two-time correlation functions of bosonic baths within a superstatistics framework by assuming that fluctuations follow the gamma distribution. We further establish a connection between superstatistics and Tsallis non-additive thermodynamics by introducing a temperature-renormalizing parameter. Our results show that, for an Ohmic model, the system's correlation functions exhibit diverse time-dependent behaviors, with the real and imaginary parts displaying enhancement or suppression depending on temperature and fluctuation strength. Additionally, we analyze the impact of these fluctuations on the quantum master equation of a damped two-level atom coupled to an out-of-equilibrium radiation bath. We demonstrate that while the equation's algebraic structure remains intact, the coupling constants are modified by the fluctuation parameters and cavity volume. Specifically, we observe that the AC Stark effect undergoes significant modifications, with fluctuations influencing the transition between repulsive and attractive energy levels.</description>

      <title>Quantum uncertainty of optical coherence</title>

Abstract: Light is known to exhibit quantum uncertainty in terms of its amplitude, phase, and polarization. However, quantum uncertainty related to coherence, which is also a fundamental physical property of light, has not been considered to date. Here, we formulate and explore the concept of quantum optical coherence uncertainty. We focus on the first-order coherence of the simplest possible light field, a purely monochromatic plane wave, which is classically completely stable. Starting from a scalar treatment, we show that the field displays zero coherence uncertainty only for a number state. We then proceed to the vectorial regime and establish that any state leads to coherence fluctuations, governed by a set of uncertainty relations depending on the polarization state and space-time points. Our work thus provides fundamental insights into the quantum character of optical coherence, with potential benefits in applications using highly sensitive interferometric and polarimetric techniques.</description>

      <title>Virtual Staining of Label-Free Tissue in Imaging Mass Spectrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful tool for untargeted, highly multiplexed molecular mapping of tissue in biomedical research. IMS offers a means of mapping the spatial distributions of molecular species in biological tissue with unparalleled chemical specificity and sensitivity. However, most IMS platforms are not able to achieve microscopy-level spatial resolution and lack cellular morphological contrast, necessitating subsequent histochemical staining, microscopic imaging and advanced image registration steps to enable molecular distributions to be linked to specific tissue features and cell types. Here, we present a virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue using a diffusion model. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with Periodic Acid-Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite utilizing IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach employs an optimized noise sampling technique during the diffusion model's inference process to reduce variance in the generated images, yielding reliable and repeatable virtual staining. We believe this virtual staining method will significantly expand the applicability of IMS in life sciences and open new avenues for mass spectrometry-based biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dependence of sensitivity on observation time induced by time crystal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider a composite atom-cavity system interacting with a ring resonator. In such a system, time crystal regime can be observed. We show that this regime can lead to a quadratic observation time dependence of the system's sensitivity to perturbations due to ability to retain the memory of the atom's initial state. Outside the time crystal regime, the system is not able to retain the memory of the atom's initial state and the sensitivity scales linearly on the observation time. Our results open up a new way for implementation of discrete time crystals in sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Pseudounitary Floquet scattering matrix for wave-front shaping in time-periodic photonic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of waves in time-varying media provides numerous opportunities for wave control that are unattainable with static media. In particular, Floquet systems with a periodic time modulation are currently of considerable interest. Here, we demonstrate how the scattering properties of a finite Floquet medium can be correctly described by a static Floquet scattering matrix, which satisfies a pseudounitary relation. This algebraic property is a consequence of the conservation of wave action for which we formulate here a continuity equation. Using this Floquet scattering matrix, we further demonstrate how it can be used to transfer concepts for wavefront-shaping based on the Wigner-Smith operator from static to Floquet systems. The eigenstates of the corresponding Floquet Wigner-Smith matrix are shown to be light pulses that are optimally shaped in both their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom for the optical micromanipulation of time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Capturing Nonlinear Electron Dynamics with Fully Characterised Attosecond X-ray Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are the key to studying electron dynamics at their natural timescale in specifically targeted electronic states. They promise to build the conceptual bridge between physical and chemical photo-reaction processes. Free-electron lasers (FELs) have demonstrated their capability of generating intense attosecond X-ray pulses. The use of SASE-based FELs for time-resolving experiments and investigations of nonlinear X-ray absorption mechanisms, however, necessitates their full pulse-to-pulse characterisation which remains a cutting-edge challenge. We have characterised X-ray pulses with durations of down to 600 attoseconds and peak powers up to 200 GW at ~1 keV photon energy via angular streaking at the Small Quantum Systems instrument of the European XFEL in Germany. As a direct application, we present results of nonlinear X-ray--matter interaction via time-resolved electron spectroscopy on a transient system, observing single- and double-core-hole generation in neon atoms. Using the derived temporal information about each single X-ray pulse, we reveal an otherwise hidden peak-intensity dependence of the probability for formation of double-core vacancies in neon after primary K-shell ionisation. Our results advance the field of attosecond science with highly intense and fully characterised X-ray pulses to the state-specific investigation of electronic motion in non-stationary media.</description>

      <title>Deep-sub-cycle ultrafast optical pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-cycle optical pulse is of great importance for ultrafast science and technology. While a narrower pulse can offer a higher temporal resolution, so far the pulse width has not reached the limit of half an optical cycle. Here we propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a deep-subwavelength-confined infrared or THz optical driving field, which can be converted into a deep-sub-cycle (i.e., less than half a cycle) ultrafast pulse by relativistic electrons passing through. Quantitatively, by using a deep-subwavelength-confined 0.4-THz 1-ps pulsed driving field and a 3-MeV 1-fs electron bunch, we obtain a $\sim$ 0.1-cycle femtosecond pulse with a peak frequency of $\sim$ 26 THz ($\sim$ 38 fs in optical cycle) and a pulse width of $\sim$ 3.6 fs; with the same driving field and a 30-MeV 50-as electron bunch, we obtain a 0.17-cycle attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of $\sim$ 2.0 PHz ($\sim$ 500 as in optical cycle) and a pulse width of $\sim$ 86 as. Below the optical damage threshold of the field-confinement material, the single-pulse photon number can exceed $10^6$. Such pulses may open opportunities for studying light-matter interaction on the deep-sub-cycle level, and pave a way to unprecedented optical technology ranging from temporal super-resolution optical microscopy and spectroscopy to unconventional atom/molecule polarization and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multiplexed Metasurfaces for Multi-Task Learning with All-Optical Diffractive Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffractive Neural Networks (DNNs) leverage the power of light to enhance computational performance in machine learning, offering a pathway to high-speed, low-energy, and large-scale neural information processing. However, most existing DNN architectures are optimized for single tasks and thus lack the flexibility required for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks within a unified artificial intelligence platform. In this work, we utilize the polarization and wavelength degrees of freedom of light to achieve optical multi-task identification using the MNIST, FMNIST, and KMNIST datasets. Employing bilayer cascaded metasurfaces, we construct dual-channel DNNs capable of simultaneously classifying two tasks, using polarization and wavelength multiplexing schemes through a meta-atom library. Numerical evaluations demonstrate performance accuracies comparable to those of individually trained single-channel, single-task DNNs. Extending this approach to three-task parallel recognition reveals an expected performance decline yet maintains satisfactory classification accuracies of greater than 80% for all tasks. We further introduce a novel end-to-end joint optimization framework to redesign the three-task classifier, demonstrating substantial improvements over the meta-atom library design and offering the potential for future multi-channel DNN designs. Our study could pave the way for the development of ultrathin, high-speed, and high-throughput optical neural computing systems.</description>

Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024)]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size.</description>

Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation depth. For the first time, we reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss of &lt;2 dB/cm, high precision exceeding 6-bits, large modulation depth with an index change as large as 4.6x10-3. Additionally, these devices offer impressive stability, maintaining minimal wavelength variation for over three weeks and enduring more than 10,000 cycles, and require a mere 0.8 pJ of energy for non-volatile operation. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical modulation. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed (48 Gbps) and energy-efficient (450 fJ/bit) signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>

Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory, and are recognized as a suitable unit in the high-density, low-dissipation microelectronic devices in condensed matter physics. Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\'e optical skyrmion clusters, where multi-skyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster that is either crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\'e optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Accurate Eye Tracking from Dense 3D Surface Reconstructions using Single-Shot Deflectometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eye-tracking plays a crucial role in the development of virtual reality devices, neuroscience research, and psychology. Despite its significance in numerous applications, achieving an accurate, robust, and fast eye-tracking solution remains a considerable challenge for current state-of-the-art methods. While existing reflection-based techniques (e.g., "glint tracking") are considered to be very accurate, their performance is limited by their reliance on sparse 3D surface data acquired solely from the cornea surface. In this paper, we rethink the way how specular reflections can be used for eye tracking: We propose a novel method for accurate and fast evaluation of the gaze direction that exploits teachings from single-shot phase-measuring-deflectometry(PMD). In contrast to state-of-the-art reflection-based methods, our method acquires dense 3D surface information of both cornea and sclera within only one single camera frame (single-shot). For a typical measurement, we acquire $&gt;3000 \times$ more surface reflection points ("glints") than conventional methods. We show the feasibility of our approach with experimentally evaluated gaze errors on a realistic model eye below only $0.12^\circ$. Moreover, we demonstrate quantitative measurements on real human eyes in vivo, reaching accuracy values between only $0.46^\circ$ and $0.97^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Processing of Quantum Information Across an Ultra-wide Optical Bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protocols for processing of quantum information are the foundation of quantum technology, enabling to share secrets at a distance, teleport quantum states, and to implement quantum computation. While many protocols were realized, and even commercialized, the throughput and processing speed of current protocols is limited by the narrow electronic bandwidth of standard measurement devices (typically in the MHz-to-GHz range), which is orders-of-magnitude lower than the optical bandwidth of available quantum optical sources (10-100 THz), indicating that the bandwidth resource is dramatically underutilized in current quantum optical technology. We present a general concept of frequency multiplexed quantum channels and a set of methods to process quantum information efficiently across the available optical bandwidth. Using a broadband source of squeezed light, spectral manipulation methods and parametric homodyne detection, we are able to generate, process and measure all the channels in parallel, thereby harnessing the optical bandwidth for quantum information in an efficient manner. We exemplify the concept through two basic protocols: Multiplexed Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and multiplexed continuous-variable quantum teleportation. The multiplexed QKD protocol is demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment, where we successfully carry out QKD over 23 uncorrelated spectral channels, with capability to detect eavesdropping in any channel. These multiplexed methods (and similar) will enable to carry out quantum processing in parallel over hundreds of channels, potentially increasing the throughput of quantum protocols by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Sensing atomic superfluid rotation beyond the standard quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Generation of Quantum Frequency Combs across Distinct Modal Families in a Single $Si_3 N_4$ Whispering Gallery Mode Resonator</title>

Abstract: Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) are versatile resources for multi-mode entanglement, such as cluster states, crucial for quantum communication and computation. On-chip whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMRs) can generate these states at ultra-low threshold power. This work demonstrates the simultaneous generation of multiple QFCs using a single on-chip silicon nitride WGMR across distinct modal families. It presents a micro-ring resonator with a radius of 240 $\mathrm{\mu m}$, capable of supporting four modal families within the 130 to 260 $\mathrm{THz}$ frequency range for consistency regulation. The results indicate that, by carefully designing the structure of silicon nitride WGMRs, it is possible to generate quantum entangled frequency combs across distinct modal families simultaneously using monochromatic pump light. It is achieved by modulating the pump mode profiles with a spatial light modulator (SLM) or an on-chip inverse-designed mode converter. This approach offers a simple and low-cost method to achieve higher-density entanglement integration on-chip.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>

Abstract: Interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is ever-increasing, driven largely by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with decomposing the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is unambiguous for massive particles, there are numerous proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here, we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, such as photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. The obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-SO(3) symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

      <title>Scattering of TE and TM waves and quantum dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a linear isotropic medium with planar symmetry can be reduced to that of their TE and TM modes. For situations where the medium consists of parallel homogeneous slabs, one may use the standard transfer matrix technique to address the scattering problem for these modes. We extend the utility of this technique to inhomogeneous permittivity and permeability profiles by proposing a dynamical formulation of the scattering of TE and TM waves in which the transfer matrix for the medium is given in terms of the evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. This leads to a system of dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes. Decoupling these equations we reduce the solution of the scattering problem for TE and TM modes to that of an initial-value problem for a Riccati equation. We discuss the application of this observation in identifying media that do not reflect TE or TM waves with given wavenumber and incidence angle.</description>

      <title>Mixing High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the mixing of laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) and x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>
