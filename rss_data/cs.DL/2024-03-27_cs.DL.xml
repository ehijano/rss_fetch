      <title>Technical Report: Incorporating Blogs in Pollux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report describes the incorporation of political blogs into Pollux, the Specialised Information Service (FID) for Political Science in Germany. Considering the widespread use of political blogs in political science research, we decided to include them in the Pollux search system to enhance the available information infrastructure. We describe the crawling and analyzing of the blogs and the pipeline that integrates them into the Pollux system. To demonstrate the content of the incorporated blogs, we also provide a visualization of the topics covered by the blog posts during the first three months following integration.</description>

      <title>Towards a FAIR Documentation of Workflows and Models in Applied Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling-Simulation-Optimization workflows play a fundamental role in applied mathematics. The Mathematical Research Data Initiative, MaRDI, responded to this by developing a FAIR and machine-interpretable template for a comprehensive documentation of such workflows. MaRDMO, a Plugin for the Research Data Management Organiser, enables scientists from diverse fields to document and publish their workflows on the MaRDI Portal seamlessly using the MaRDI template. Central to these workflows are mathematical models. MaRDI addresses them with the MathModDB ontology, offering a structured formal model description. Here, we showcase the interaction between MaRDMO and the MathModDB Knowledge Graph through an algebraic modeling workflow from the Digital Humanities. This demonstration underscores the versatility of both services beyond their original numerical domain.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Scholarly Research on Open Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of open knowledge graphs has led to a surge in scholarly research on the topic over the past decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the scholarly literature on open knowledge graphs published between 2013 and 2023. The study aims to identify the trends, patterns, and impact of research in this field, as well as the key topics and research questions that have emerged. The work uses bibliometric techniques to analyze a sample of 4445 scholarly articles retrieved from Scopus. The findings reveal an ever-increasing number of publications on open knowledge graphs published every year, particularly in developed countries (+50 per year). These outputs are published in highly-referred scholarly journals and conferences. The study identifies three main research themes: (1) knowledge graph construction and enrichment, (2) evaluation and reuse, and (3) fusion of knowledge graphs into NLP systems. Within these themes, the study identifies specific tasks that have received considerable attention, including entity linking, knowledge graph embedding, and graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Data journeys in popular science: Producing climate change and COVID-19 data visualizations at Scientific American</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vast amounts of (open) data are increasingly used to make arguments about crisis topics such as climate change and global pandemics. Data visualizations are central to bringing these viewpoints to broader publics. However, visualizations often conceal the many contexts involved in their production, ranging from decisions made in research labs about collecting and sharing data to choices made in editorial rooms about which data stories to tell. In this paper, we examine how data visualizations about climate change and COVID-19 are produced in popular science magazines, using Scientific American, an established English-language popular science magazine, as a case study. To do this, we apply the analytical concept of data journeys (Leonelli, 2020) in a mixed methods study that centers on interviews with Scientific American staff and is supplemented by a visualization analysis of selected charts. In particular, we discuss the affordances of working with open data, the role of collaborative data practices, and how the magazine works to counter misinformation and increase transparency. This work provides an empirical contribution by providing insight into the data (visualization) practices of science communicators and demonstrating how the concept of data journeys can be used as an analytical framework.</description>

      <title>A proof-of-concept online metadata catalogue service of Earth observation datasets for human health research in exposomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes research carried out during 2023 under an International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)-funded project to develop and disseminate a metadata catalogue of Earth observation data sources/products and types that are relevant to human health research in exposomics, as a free service to interested researchers worldwide. The proof-of-concept catalogue was informed by input from existing research literature on the subject (desk research), as well as online communications with, and relevant research publications collected from, a small panel (n = 5) of select experts from the academia in three countries (China, UK and USA). It has 90 metadata records of relevant Earth observation datasets (n = 40) and associated health-focused research publications (n = 50). The project's online portal offers a searchable version of the catalogue featuring a number of search modes and filtering options. It is hoped future, more comprehensive versions of this service will enable more researchers and studies to discover and use remote sensing data about population-level exposures to disease determinants (exposomic determinants of disease) in combination with other relevant data to reveal fresh insights that could improve our understanding of relevant diseases, and hence contribute to the development of better-optimized prevention and management plans to tackle them.</description>

      <title>A proposal to improve the calculation of the disruption index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wu et al. (2019) proposed the disruption index (DI1) as a bibliometric indicator that measures disruptive and consolidating research. Leibel and Bornmann (2024) recently published a literature overview on the disruption index research in Scientometrics. In this letter to the editor, we point out that the method of calculating the DI1 score of a focal paper contains a logical impact measurement error that leads to a meaningful reduction of the score. We explain why this is problematic and propose a correction of the formula.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Biomedical and Health Informatics: A Bibliometric Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. This bibliometric review serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI.</description>
