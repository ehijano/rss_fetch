      <title>Quantitative Risk Management in Volatile Markets with an Expectile-Based Framework for the FTSE Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a framework for quantitative risk management in volatile markets, specifically focusing on expectile-based methodologies applied to the FTSE 100 index. Traditional risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) have demonstrated significant limitations during periods of market stress, as evidenced during the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent volatile periods. This study develops an advanced expectile-based framework that addresses the shortcomings of conventional quantile-based approaches by providing greater sensitivity to tail losses and improved stability in extreme market conditions. The research employs a dataset spanning two decades of FTSE 100 returns, incorporating periods of high volatility, market crashes, and recovery phases. Our methodology introduces novel mathematical formulations for expectile regression models, enhanced threshold determination techniques using time series analysis, and robust backtesting procedures. The empirical results demonstrate that expectile-based Value-at-Risk (EVaR) consistently outperforms traditional VaR measures across various confidence levels and market conditions. The framework exhibits superior performance during volatile periods, with reduced model risk and enhanced predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the study establishes practical implementation guidelines for financial institutions and provides evidence-based recommendations for regulatory compliance and portfolio management. The findings contribute significantly to the literature on financial risk management and offer practical tools for practitioners dealing with volatile market environments.</description>

      <title>PELVaR: Probability equal level representation of Value at Risk through the notion of Flexible Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel perspective on the relationship between Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by employing the mixing framework of Flexible Expected Shortfall (FES) to construct coherent representations of VaR. The methodology enables a reinterpretation of VaR within a coherent risk measure framework, thereby addressing well-known limitations of VaR, including non-subadditivity and insensitivity to tail risk. A central feature of the framework is the flexibility parameter inherent in FES, which captures salient distributional properties of the underlying risk profile. This parameter is formalized as the $\theta$-index, a normalized measure designed to reflect tail heaviness. Theoretical properties of the $\theta$-index are examined, and its relevance to risk assessment is established. Furthermore, risk capital allocation is analyzed using the Euler principle, facilitating consistent and meaningful marginal attribution. The practical implications of the approach are illustrated through appropriate simulation studies and an empirical analysis based on an insurance loss dataset with pronounced heavy-tailed characteristics.</description>

      <title>Eliciting reference measures of law-invariant functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Law-invariant functionals are central to risk management and assign identical values to random prospects sharing the same distribution under an atomless reference probability measure. This measure is typically assumed fixed. Here, we adopt the reverse perspective: given only observed functional values, we aim to either recover the reference measure or identify a candidate measure to test for law invariance when that property is not {\em a priori} satisfied. Our approach is based on a key observation about law-invariant functionals defined on law-invariant domains. These functionals define lower (upper) supporting sets in dual spaces of signed measures, and the suprema (infima) of these supporting sets -- if existent -- are scalar multiples of the reference measure. In specific cases, this observation can be formulated as a sandwich theorem.
  We illustrate the methodology through a detailed analysis of prominent examples: the entropic risk measure, Expected Shortfall, and Value-at-Risk. For the latter, our elicitation procedure initially fails due to the triviality of supporting set extrema. We therefore develop a suitable modification.</description>

      <title>The TruEnd-procedure: Treating trailing zero-valued balances in credit data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17008v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented for finding the true but latent endpoints within the repayment histories of individual loans. The monthly observations beyond these true endpoints are false, largely due to operational failures that delay account closure, thereby corrupting some loans. Detecting these false observations is difficult at scale since each affected loan history might have a different sequence of trailing zero (or very small) month-end balances. Identifying these trailing balances requires an exact definition of a "small balance", which our method informs. We demonstrate this procedure and isolate the ideal small-balance definition using two different South African datasets. Evidently, corrupted loans are remarkably prevalent and have excess histories that are surprisingly long, which ruin the timing of risk events and compromise any subsequent time-to-event model, e.g., survival analysis. Having discarded these excess histories, we demonstrably improve the accuracy of both the predicted timing and severity of risk events, without materially impacting the portfolio. The resulting estimates of credit losses are lower and less biased, which augurs well for raising accurate credit impairments under IFRS 9. Our work therefore addresses a pernicious data error, which highlights the pivotal role of data preparation in producing credible forecasts of credit risk.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating binary probabilistic classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recalibration of binary probabilistic classifiers to a target prior probability is an important task in areas like credit risk management. We analyse methods for recalibration from a distribution shift perspective. Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a probabilistic classifier are found to be useful for the design of meaningful recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed and tested together with some other methods in an example setting. The outcomes of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functionals like for instance risk weights functions for credit risk.</description>
