      <title>Resonant suppression of the above-barrier fusion cross-section in $^{19}$O + $^{12}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion excitation functions for $^{19}$O and $^{19}$F + $^{12}$C were simultaneously measured along with $^{20}$O + $^{12}$C using the active-target detector MuSIC@Indiana. Examination of the cross-section just above the barrier reveals a significant suppression of fusion for the $^{19}$O + $^{12}$C system at E$_{c.m.}$~12 MeV. This suppression may be due to the formation of a transient $^{18}$O-n-$^{12}$C molecule-like complex favored at a particular angular momentum. Mean-field level models are used as a reference to understand the measured fusion excitation functions.</description>

      <title>A Safer, Smaller, Cleaner Subcritical Thorium Fission - Deuteron Fusion Hybrid Reactor: DD Collider Instead of Muonic Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fossil fuels, which meet most of humanity's energy needs, cause climate change due to their high carbon emissions. There are two types of energy sources that can replace fossil fuels: renewable and nuclear. Nuclear energy sources are more advantageous in terms of efficiency and sustainability. The use of Thorium as nuclear fuel in fusion reactors will contribute to the reduction of radioactive waste, due to the much lower production of transuranics. Fusion reactors, which are considered promising, are still in the R&amp;D phase. In this respect, hybrid fusion-fission reactors seem more promising and the recently proposed combination of muon-catalyzed DD fusion with a cascade thorium reactor is worthy of appreciation. In this study, we show that using the DD collider instead of muonic fusion has significant advantages.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the multiplicity dependence of Upsilon production ratios in pp collisions at centre of mass energy 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) production cross-sections are measured relative to that of the Upsilon(1S) meson, as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The measurement uses data collected by the LHCb experiment in 2018 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2fb^{-1}. Both the Upsilon(2S)-to-Upsilon(1S) and Upsilon(3S)-to-Upsilon(1S) cross-section ratios are found to decrease significantly as a function of event multiplicity, with the Upsilon(3S)-to-Upsilon(1S) ratio showing a steeper decline towards high multiplicity. This hierarchy is qualitatively consistent with the comover model predictions, indicating that final-state interactions play an important role in bottomonia production in high-multiplicity events.</description>

      <title>Decay spectroscopy of heavy and superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After more than half a century after the first predictions of the so-called "island of stability of superheavy nuclei", exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from Z=99 (einsteinium) to Z=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>
