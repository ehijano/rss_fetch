      <title>Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be addressed with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not produce resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.</description>

      <title>Accurate experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data of natural gas mixtures for the assessment of reference equations of state when dealing with hydrogen-enriched natural gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GERG-2008 equation of state is the approved ISO standard (ISO 20765-2) for the calculation of thermophysical properties of natural gas mixtures. The composition of natural gas can vary considerably due to the diversity of origin. Further diversification was generated by adding hydrogen, biogas, or other non-conventional energy gases. In this work, high-precision experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data for two gravimetrically prepared synthetic natural gas mixtures are reported. One mixture resembled a conventional natural gas of 11 components (11 M) with a nominal mixture composition (amount-of-substance fraction) of 0.8845 for methane as the matrix compound. The other mixture was a 13-component hydrogen-enriched natural gas with a low calorific value featuring a nominal composition of 0.7885 for methane. Density measurements were performed in an isothermal operational mode at temperatures between 260 and 350 K and at pressures up to 20 MPa by using a single-sinker densimeter with magnetic suspension coupling. The data were compared with the corresponding densities calculated from both GERG-2008 and AGA8-DC92 equations of state to test their performance on real mixtures. The average absolute deviation from GERG-2008 (AGA8-DC92) is 0.027% (0.078%) for 11 M and 0.095% (0.062%) for the 13-component $H_{2}$-enriched mixture, respectively. The corresponding maximum relative deviation from GERG-2008 (AGA8-DC92) amounts to 0.095% (0.127%) for 11 M and 0.291% (0.193%) for the $H_{2}$-enriched mixture.</description>

      <title>Integrating Experiment with Theory to Determine the Structure of Electrode-Electrolyte Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrode-electrolyte interfaces are crucial for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. At these interfaces, the liquid electrolytes form electrical double layers (EDLs). However, despite more than a century of active research, the fundamental structure of EDLs remains elusive to date. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations have both provided insights, yet each method by itself only offers incomplete or inexact information of the multifaceted EDL structure. Here we provide a survey of the mainstream approaches for EDL quantification, with a particular focus on the emerging 3D atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM) imaging which provides real-space atomic-scale EDL structures. To overcome the existing limits of EDL characterization methods, we propose a new approach to integrate 3D-AFM with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, to enable realistic, precise, and high-throughput determination and prediction of EDL structures. As examples of real-world application, we will discuss the feasibility of using this joint experiment-theory method to unravel the EDL structure at various carbon-based electrodes for supercapacitors, batteries, and electrocatalysis. Looking forward, we believe 3D-AFM, future versions of scanning probe microscopy, and their integration with theory offer promising platforms to profile liquid structures in many electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics through Informed Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible using standard simulation methods. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. Here, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting, both for molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We then employ recently obtained theoretical results to identify the condition that leads to the greatest acceleration and to infer the unbiased mean transition time from accelerated simulations. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Updated determination of the molar gas constant $R$ by acoustic measurements in argon at UVa-CEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new determination of the molar gas constant was performed from measurements of the speed of sound in argon at the triple point of water and extrapolation to zero pressure. A new resonant cavity was used. This is a triaxial ellipsoid whose walls are gold-coated steel and which is divided into two identical halves that are bolted and sealed with an O-ring. Microwave and electroacoustic traducers are located in the northern and southern parts of the cavity, respectively, so that measurements of microwave and acoustic frequencies are carried out in the same experiment. Measurements were taken at pressures from 600 kPa to 60 kPa and at 273.16 K. The internal equivalent radius of the cavity was accurately determined by microwave measurements and the first four radial symmetric acoustic modes were simultaneously measured and used to calculate the speed of sound. The improvements made using the new cavity have reduced by half the main contributions to the uncertainty due to the radius determination using microwave measurements which amounts to 4.7 parts in $10^{6}$ and the acoustic measurements, 4.4 parts in $10^{6}$, where the main contribution (3.7 parts in $10^{6}$) is the relative excess half-widths associated with the limit of our acoustic model, compared with our previous measurements. As a result of all the improvements with the new cavity and the measurements performed, we determined the molar gas constant $R$ = (8.314 449 $\pm$ 0.000 056) J/(K mol) which corresponds to a relative standard uncertainty of 6.7 parts in $10^{6}$. The value reported in this paper lies -1.3 parts in $10^{6}$ below the recommended value of CODATA 2014, although still within the range consistent with it.</description>

      <title>Orientational effects in alkanone, alkanal or dialkyl carbonate + alkane mixtures and in alkanone + alkanone or + dialkyl carbonate systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions and structure of alkanone, or alkanal or dialkyl carbonate + alkane mixtures, or of 2-alkanone+ 2-alkanone, or of ketone + dialkyl carbonate systems have been investigated by means of a set of thermodynamic properties and by the application of the Flory model. The properties considered are excess molar quantities: enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, or isobaric heat capacities, $C_{p \text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and liquid-liquid equilibria. Experimental data show that alkane mixtures are characterized by rather strong dipolar interactions. In the case of systems containing ketones with the same number of C atoms and a given alkane, dipolar interactions become weaker in the sequence: aromatic &gt; cyclic &gt; linear. In addition, the mentioned interactions become also weaker in the order: dialkyl carbonate &gt; linear alkanone &gt; linear alkanal. This is an important result, as carbonates show lower effective dipole moments than the other compounds, and it suggests that the group size may be relevant when evaluating thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures. Results on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ from the Flory model show that orientational effects (i.e., non-random mixing) are rather similar for systems with linear, cyclic or aromatic ketones or alkanals and alkanes. In contrast, orientational effects become weaker in dialkyl carbonate + alkane mixtures. The behaviour of 2-alkanone + 2-alkanone systems and of mixtures of longer 2-alkanones or cyclohexanone with dialkyl carbonate is close to random mixing. Larger orientational effects are encountered in solutions of carbonates and shorter 2-alkanones.</description>

      <title>Advanced perturbation scheme for efficient polarizability computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient momentum based perturbation scheme to evaluate polarizability tensors of small molecules and at the fraction of the computational cost compared to conventional energy based perturbation schemes. Furthermore, the simplicity of the scheme allows for the seamless integration into modern quantum chemistry codes. We apply the method to systems where the wavefunctions are described on a real-space grid and are therefore not subject to finite size basis set errors. In the grid-based scheme errors can be attributed to the resolution and the size of the grid-space. The applicability and generality of the method is exhibited by calculating polarizability tensors including the dipole-dipole and up to the quadrupole-quadrupole for a series of small molecules, representing the most common symmetry groups. By a direct comparison with standard techniques based on energy perturbation we show that the method reduces the number of explicit computations by a factor of 30. Numerical errors introduced due to the arrangement of the explicit point charges are eliminated with an extrapolation scheme to the effective zero-perturbation limit.</description>

      <title>Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments, especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge density, which reduces the scaling $\mathcal{O}(N_\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method with MM system to $\mathcal{O}(N_\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred dipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of acrolein.</description>

      <title>Resonant molecular transitions in second harmonic generation spectroscopy of Fe-octaethylporphyrin adsorbed on Cu(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic molecular adsorbates on metallic surfaces offer the potential to both generate materials for future (spin-)electronics applications as well as a better fundamental understanding of molecule-substrate interaction, provided that the electronic properties of such interfaces can be analyzed and/or manipulated in a targeted manner. To investigate electronic interactions at such interfaces, we measure optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from iron-octaethylporphyrin (FeOEP) adsorbed on Cu(001), and perform electronic structure calculations using coupled cluster methods including optical excitations. We find that the SHG response of FeOEP/Cu(001) is modified at 2.15-2.35 eV fundamental photon energy compared to the bare Cu(001) surface. Our polarization-dependent analysis shows that the $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ non-linear susceptibility tensor element dominates this modification. The first-principles calculations confirm this effect and conclude a resonantly enhanced SHG by molecular transitions at $\hbar\omega \geq 2$ eV. We show that the enhancement of $\chi^{(2)}_{zzz}$ results from a strong charge-transfer character of the molecule-substrate interaction. Our findings demonstrate the suitability of surface SHG for the characterization of such interfaces and the potential to employ it for time-resolved SHG experiments on optically induced electronic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Smart Resetting: An Energy-Efficient Strategy for Stochastic Search Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, a method for accelerating target search in random processes, often incurs temporal and energetic costs. For a diffusing particle, a lower bound exists for the energetic cost of reaching the target, which is attained at low resetting rates and equals the direct linear transportation cost against fluid drag. Here, we study ``smart resetting," a strategy that aims to beat this lower bound. By strategically resetting the particle only when this benefits its progress toward the target, smart resetting leverages information to minimize energy consumption. We analytically calculate the energetic cost per mean first passage time and show that smart resetting consistently reduces the energetic cost compared to regular resetting. Surprisingly, smart resting achieves the minimum energy cost previously established for regular resetting, irrespective of the resetting rate. Yet, it fails to reduce this cost further. We extend our findings in two ways: first, by examining nonlinear energetic cost functions, and second, by considering smart resetting of drift-diffusion processes.</description>

While machine learning has been making a great impact, it is still not reaching its full potential or maturity. In this perspective, we first outline current applications across a diversity of problems in chemistry. Then, we discuss how machine learning researchers view and approach problems in the field.

      <description>arXiv:2406.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe version 2 of the SPICE dataset, a collection of quantum chemistry calculations for training machine learning potentials. It expands on the original dataset by adding much more sampling of chemical space and more data on non-covalent interactions. We train a set of potential energy functions called Nutmeg on it. They are based on the TensorNet architecture. They use a novel mechanism to improve performance on charged and polar molecules, injecting precomputed partial charges into the model to provide a reference for the large scale charge distribution. Evaluation of the new models shows they do an excellent job of reproducing energy differences between conformations, even on highly charged molecules or ones that are significantly larger than the molecules in the training set. They also produce stable molecular dynamics trajectories, and are fast enough to be useful for routine simulation of small molecules.</description>

      <title>Exciting DeePMD: Learning excited state energies, forces, and non-adiabatic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the DeePMD neural network architecture to predict electronic structure properties necessary to perform non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. While learning the excited state energies and forces follows a straightforward extension of the DeePMD approach for ground-state energies and forces, how to learn the map between the non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACV) and the local chemical environment descriptors of DeePMD is less trivial. Most implementations of machine-learning-based non-adiabatic dynamics inherently approximate the NACVs, with an underlying assumption that the energy-difference-scaled NACVs are conservative fields. We overcome this approximation, implementing the method recently introduced by Richardson [J. Chem. Phys. 158 011102 (2023)], which learns the symmetric dyad of the energy-difference-scaled NACV. The efficiency and accuracy of our neural network architecture is demonstrated through the example of the methaniminium cation CH$_2$NH$_2^+$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Using Linearized Pair-Density Functional Theory</title>

Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is an effective method for modeling nonradiative decay in electronically excited molecules. Its accuracy depends strongly on the quality of the potential energy surfaces, and its affordability for long direct-dynamic simulations with adequate ensemble averaging depends strongly on the cost of the required electronic structure calculations. Linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed post-self-consistent field multireference method that can model potential energy surfaces with an accuracy similar to expensive multireference perturbation theories but at a computational cost similar to the underlying multiconfiguration self-consistent field method. Here we integrate the SHARC dynamics and PySCF electronic structure code to utilize L-PDFT for electronically nonadiabatic calculations and use the combined programs to study the photoisomerization reaction of cis-azomethane. We show that L-PDFT is able to successfully simulate the photoisomerization and yields results similar to the more expensive extended multi-state complete active space second-order perturbation theory. This shows that L-PDFT can model internal conversion, and it demonstrates its promise for broader photodynamics applications.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Propellant Discovery For Electrospray Thrusters Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a machine learning framework to predict the suitability of ionic liquids with unknown physical properties as propellants for electrospray thrusters based on their molecular structure. We construct a training dataset by labeling ionic liquids as suitable (+1) or unsuitable (-1) for electrospray thrusters based on their density, viscosity, and surface tension. The ionic liquids are represented by their molecular descriptors calculated using the Mordred package. We evaluate four machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with SVM demonstrating superior predictive performance. The SVM predicts 193 candidate propellants from a dataset of ionic liquids with unknown physical properties. Further, we employ Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to assess and rank the impact of individual molecular descriptors on model decisions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic VQE calculations of molecular electric dipole moments on trapped ion quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is among the most actively studied topics in atomic and molecular calculations on quantum computers, yet few studies address properties other than energies or account for relativistic effects. This work presents high-precision 18-qubit relativistic VQE simulations for calculating the permanent electric dipole moments (PDMs) of BeH to RaH molecules on traditional computers, and 6- and 12-qubit PDM computations for SrH on IonQ quantum devices. To achieve high precision on current noisy intermediate scale era quantum hardware, we apply various resource reduction methods, including Reinforcement Learning and causal flow preserving ZX-Calculus routines, along with error mitigation and post-selection techniques. Our approach reduces the two-qubit gate count in our 12-qubit circuit by 99.71%, with only a 2.35% trade-off in precision for PDM when evaluated classically within a suitably chosen active space. On the current generation IonQ Forte-I hardware, the error in PDM is -1.17% relative to classical calculations and only 1.21% compared to the unoptimized circuit.</description>

      <title>Towards Fully Autonomous Research Powered by LLMs: Case Study on Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for the automation of scientific research, spanning both experimental processes and computational simulations. This study explores the feasibility of constructing an autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM, through sophisticated API integration, to automate the entire research process, from experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation. Using a simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a case study, we assessed the performance of ASAs powered by different LLMs including GPT-4-Turbo. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless execution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of LLMs to manage complete scientific investigations autonomously. The outlined automation can be iteratively performed up to twenty cycles without human intervention, illustrating the potential of LLMs for large-scale autonomous research endeavors. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASAs in managing extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms and the balance between local attention and global oversight.</description>
