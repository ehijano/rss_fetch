      <title>Classification of Solutions with Polynomial Energy Growth for the SU (n + 1) Toda System on the Punctured Complex Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the classification of solutions satisfying the polynomial energy growth condition near both the origin and infinity to the ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system on the punctured complex plane $\mathbb{C}^*$. The ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system is a class of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations of second order with significant implications in integrable systems, quantum field theory, and differential geometry. Building on the work of A. Eremenko (J. Math. Phys. Anal. Geom., Volume 3 p.39-46), Jingyu Mu's thesis, and others, we obtain the classification of such solutions by leveraging techniques from the Nevanlinna theory. In particular, we prove that the unitary curve corresponding to a solution with polynomial energy growth to the ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system on $\mathbb{C}^*$ gives a set of fundamental solutions to a linear homogeneous ODE of $(n+1)^{th}$ order, and each coefficient of the ODE can be written as a sum of a polynomial in $z$ and another one in $\frac{1}{z}$.</description>

      <title>Shifted nonlocal reductions of 5-component Maccari system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that shifted nonlocal reductions of integrable $(2+1)$-dimensional $5$-component Maccari system are particular cases of shifted scale transformations. We present all shifted nonlocal reductions of this system and obtain new two-place and four-place integrable systems and equations. In addition to that we use the Hirota direct method and obtain one-soliton solution of the $5$-component Maccari system. By using the reduction formulas with the solution of the Maccari system we also derive soliton solutions of the shifted nonlocal reduced Maccari systems and equations. We give some particular examples of solutions with their graphs.</description>

      <title>On Cauchy problem to the modified Camassa-Holm equation: Painlev\'{e} asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Painlev\'{e} asymptotics for the Cauchy problem of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with zero boundary conditions \begin{align*}\nonumber &amp;m_t+\left((u^2-u_x^2)m\right)_x=0, \ (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+,\\ &amp;u(x,0)=u_0(x), \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} u_0(x)=0, \end{align*} where $u_0(x)\in H^{4,2}(\mathbb{R})$. Recently, Yang and Fan (Adv. Math. 402, 108340 (2022)) reported the long-time asymptotic result for the mCH equation in the solitonic regions. The main purpose of our work is to study the long-time asymptotic behavior in two transition regions. The key to proving this result is to establish and analyze the Riemann-Hilbert problem on a new plane $(y;t)$ related to the Cauchy problem of the mCH equation. With the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and double scaling limit technique, in two transition regions defined by \begin{align}\nonumber \mathcal{P}_{I}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant |\frac{x}{t}-2|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\},~~~~\mathcal{P}_{II}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant |\frac{x}{t}+1/4|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\}, \end{align} where $C&gt;0$ is a constant, we find that the leading order approximation to the solution of the mCH equation can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II equation.</description>

      <title>Nondegenerate Akhmediev breathers and abnormal frequency jumping in multicomponent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear stage of higher-order modulation instability (MI) phenomena in the frame of multicomponent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLSEs) are studied analytically and numerically. Our analysis shows that the $N$-component NLSEs can reduce to $N-m+1$ components, when $m(\leq N)$ wavenumbers of the plane wave are equal. As an example, we study systematically the case of three-component NLSEs which cannot reduce to the one- or two-component NLSEs. We demonstrate in both focusing and defocusing regimes, the excitation and existence diagram of a class of nondegenerate Akhmediev breathers formed by nonlinear superposition between several fundamental breathers with the same unstable frequency but corresponding to different eigenvalues. The role of such excitation in higher-order MI is revealed by considering the nonlinear evolution starting with a pair of unstable frequency sidebands. It is shown that the spectrum evolution expands over several higher harmonics and contains several spectral expansion-contraction cycles. In particular, abnormal unstable frequency jumping over the stable gaps between the instability bands are observed in both defocusing and focusing regimes. We outline the initial excitation diagram of abnormal frequency jumping in the frequency-wavenumber plane. We confirm the numerical results by exact solutions of multi-Akhmediev breathers of the multi-component NLSEs.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of Turbulent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations, with a passive scalar (concentration, temperature, or other scalar field) driven by the turbulent velocity field. Using our recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of the Euler ensemble, we represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation and match them with physical and real experiments.</description>

      <title>On a class of exact solutions of the Ishimori equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of particular solutions of the Ishimori equation is found. This equation is known as the spatially two-dimensional version of the Heisenberg equation, which has important applications in the theory of ferromagnets. It is shown that the two-dimensional Toda-type lattice found earlier by Ferapontov, Shabat and Yamilov is a dressing chain for this equation. Using the integrable reductions of the dressing chain, the authors found an essentially new class of solutions to the Ishimori equation.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya-Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\mathbb{N}$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e. quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller-Lieb-Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elaborate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: Hodograph equations for the Euler equation in curved spaces with constant pressure are discussed. It is shown that the use of known results concerning geodesics and associated integrals allows to construct several types of hodograph equations. These hodograph equations provide us with various classes of solutions of the Euler equation, including stationary solutions. Particular cases of cone and sphere in the 3-dimensional Eulidean space are analysed in detail. Euler equation on the sphere in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space is considered too.</description>

      <title>Coupling and particle number intertwiners in the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formul\ae\ for the intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</description>
