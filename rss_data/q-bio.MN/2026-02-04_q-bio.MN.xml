      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in inducible three-gene toggle switch networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes, including those mediated by gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Within these circuits, two- and three-gene network motifs are particularly critical to the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, often vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this study, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous in regulatory processes across many biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then analyze how the dynamics evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, underlying inducer activity, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.</description>

      <title>Merged ChemProt-DrugProt for Relation Extraction from Biomedical Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraction of chemical-gene relations plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interactions between chemical compounds and genes, with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biomedical research. This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets. Incorporating the global context using GCN can help increase the overall precision and recall in some of the CPR groups over using just BioBERT.</description>
