      <title>Conformal symmetry in force-free electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that conformal symmetry exists in force-free electrodynamics (FFE) in Minkowski spacetime, a foundational framework for describing magnetospheres around astronomical objects. In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under M\"obius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Dymnikova Black Hole Immersed in Perfect Fluid Dark Matter and a Cloud of Strings: Hawking Temperature, Dynamics and QPOs Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dymnikova black hole represents a regular spacetime solution interpolating between a de Sitter core and an asymptotically Schwarzschild geometry. In this work, we investigate a generalized Dymnikova black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and immersed in a cloud of strings (CS). We analyze how these additional matter sources modify the thermodynamic, optical, and dynamical properties of the spacetime.
  We derive the Hawking temperature and specific heat capacity and examine the thermal stability and phase structure of the black hole. The results reveal non-monotonic temperature behavior and parameter-dependent phase transitions. We further study photon dynamics, including the photon sphere and black hole shadow, and show that both PFDM and string cloud parameters significantly affect the shadow radius and strong-field structure.
  Additionally, we investigate the motion of massive test particles, circular orbits, and stability conditions. The corresponding effective potentials, specific energy, and angular momentum are analyzed. Finally, we explore quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) by computing the fundamental epicyclic frequencies and discuss how the model parameters encode observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Kasner Singularity of Black Holes in Einstein-scalar Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spacelike Kasner singularity of spherically-symmetric, static and asymptotically flat black holes in Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar with a suitable self-interacting scalar potential. We focus on how the asymptotic information such as the mass and scalar charge affect the properties of the Kasner singularity, including the Kasner exponents. We show how a nontrivial integration constant can be extracted from the near-singularity geometry and find a general pattern that this integration constant asymptotes to a linear combination of the mass and scalar charge at large mass limit. We also find that there may be a black hole upper bound on the maximum surviving time of a massive particle inside such a black hole before it falls into the Kasner singularity, and the Schwarzschild black hole saturate this bound.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy in $(2+1)$ Gravity: A Thermo Field Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy of a real massive scalar field near a non-rotating BTZ black hole using Thermo Field Dynamics. Modeling the black hole as a collapsing dust shell in AdS3, we derive the shell trajectory R(t) as seen by a Fiducial Observer (FIDO). From the Hartle-Hawking and Killing-Boulware vacua, we obtain the Wightman function difference and compute energy density, revealing a sharply localized energy density just outside the horizon, consistent with the brick wall picture. A full thermodynamic analysis yields an entanglement entropy proportional to the horizon area, numerically matching the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. All intermediate steps, including junction conditions, Kruskal extension, WKB modes, and UV regularization, are explicitly detailed.</description>

      <title>Periodic Analogs of Multiple Black Holes Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the numerical studies developed in [arXiv:2210.12898] to construct periodic stationary axisymmetric solutions containing multiple horizons in each fundamental domain. As a direct application, we consider periodic stationary axisymmetric solutions with two identical equidistant counter-rotating horizons. These solutions can be parametrized by the period $L$, the mass $M$, and the absolute value of the angular momentum $|J| &gt;0$. We provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of such configurations, without any restriction in terms of the distance between horizons. This is in sharp contrast with the non-zero total angular momentum case, as it was recently established in \cite{Peraza:2024uto} that static single-horizon periodic solutions cannot be put into rotation if $L &lt; 4M$. It is shown that these solutions do not have any struts on the axis, and it is also explicitly shown that, by taking non-equidistant horizons, struts develop between the black holes. Other global properties of the solutions are also presented.</description>

      <title>WKB-like approach to the Unruh temperature for arbitrary acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the Unruh temperature as arising from tunneling through a barrier for an observer in flat Minkowski spacetime with arbitrary acceleration $a(t)$. For the defining case of constant acceleration $a(t) = a_0$, the Unruh temperature (W. Unruh, Phys. Rev. D 14, 870 (1976)) is given by $k_b\,T_U =\tfrac{\hbar\,a_0}{2\,\pi\,c}$. Extending the work of de Gill et al. (A. de Gill, D. Singleton, V. Akhmedova and T. Pilling, Am. J. Phys. 78, 685 (2010)) we generalize the gravitational WKB approach to derive the Unruh temperature for arbitrary acceleration. We show that the often employed Schwarzschild-like form of the flat metric is not appropriate for the WKB calculation with an arbitrary $a(t)$, and instead derive a generalized Unruh temperature for the generalized Rindler metric where $a_0\to a(t)$. We derive a generalization of the Rindler coordinates appropriate for arbitrary $a(t)$, and stress the importance of the role of the integrated acceleration $\chi(t) = \int^t dt'\,a(t')$, which can also act as a temporal coordinate. We explore several non-trivial examples of $a(t)$ and their generalized Unruh temperatures. We additionally develop an approximation to the Unruh temperature for small deviations away from constant acceleration by the standard approach of considering the negative frequency content of a purely positive frequency plane wave of an inertial observer, as measured by the co-moving arbitrarily accelerated observer. Lastly, we develop and explicit coordinate transformation between the arbitrarily accelerated observer and conformal coordinates, where the plane wave structure of the solutions of the wave equation is readily transparent, and analogous to the form for the inertial observer.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrected thermodynamics and horizon quantization of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we develop a unified semiclassical framework for the thermodynamics and quantization of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole (BH) based on the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass. Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Vacuum Transitions in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Lorentzian vacuum transition probabilities between two minima of a scalar field potential within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. The analysis extends the previously considered WKB expansion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to modified gravity theories, up to second order. We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically investigate the deflection of light for strong- and weak-field regimes in the background of an electrically charged BH described in Kalb-Ramond gravity, which introduces the Lorentz symmetry violation parameter $l$, as well as the control of the degree of nonlinearity incorporated by electrodynamics through the parameter $\gamma$. We analytically constructed the expansion coefficients in both limits and used them as a basis to investigate gravitational lensing effects through observables, taking into account the variation of the parameters involved in the model, both for the canonical field and the phantom case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes (BHs) embedded within a cloud of strings and immersed in perfect fluid dark matter. Also, beginning with the underlying spacetime geometry, we determine how quantum corrections, string cloud contributions, and dark matter effects alter the geometrical structure and physical characteristics of the BH. Also, the optical behavior is investigated via a systematic analysis of the photon sphere and the associated BH shadow, emphasizing possible observational features capable of differentiating this configuration from classical models. We also analyze the motion of test particles, focusing on how surrounding matter components affect trajectories, stability conditions, and effective potentials. Scalar field perturbations are considered to investigate the BH response to external excitations and to extract information regarding its dynamical properties. In this case, the thermodynamic behavior of the system is studied, including the role of string clouds and dark matter in modifying BH thermodynamic quantities. Also, the obtained results present a unified description of the combined effects of quantum corrections, nonstandard matter sources, and BH physics, with potential relevance for both observational constraints and theoretical modeling of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Testing the Weak Gravity Conjecture via Gravitational Lensing, Black Hole Shadows, and Barrow Thermodynamics in F(R)-Euler-Heisenberg (A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) in $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg black holes in Anti-de Sitter and de Sitter backgrounds. The solution is characterized by the electric charge $q$, the $F(R)$ deviation $f_{R_0}$, the Euler--Heisenberg coupling $\lambda$, and the constant scalar curvature $R_0$. We establish a universal entropy--extremality relation that provides thermodynamic evidence for the WGC independently of $f_{R_0}$ and $R_0$. Photon sphere analysis from both geodesic and topological perspectives confirms the simultaneous compatibility of the WGC and WCCC, with the Euler--Heisenberg coupling restoring photon spheres in the naked singularity regime. Gravitational lensing in the strong- and weak-deflection limits reveals that the photon sphere radius is independent of the cosmological background while the critical impact parameter nearly doubles in de Sitter. Black hole shadow images under isotropic accretion are constructed. Within the Barrow entropy framework, we uncover van der Waals-type phase transitions and analyze Joule-Thomson expansion, identifying the small black hole phase as the WGC-compatible thermodynamic regime accessible via isenthalpic cooling.</description>

      <title>Charged scalar and Dirac perturbations on a global monopole Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole: quasinormal modes and strong cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perturbations of charged scalar and Dirac fields around Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black holes with a global monopole. To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Gravity on a Graph I: Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript is the first in a series of instalments that investigate spherically symmetric solutions within the effective dynamics program of Loop Quantum Gravity. The choice of lattice is adapted such that it remains invariant under a set of symmetry transformations maximally mapping spherical symmetry to the discrete setting. The conditions for symmetry restriction of the dynamics are investigated and a subspace is identified to make computations feasible. Afterwards symplectic structure and scalar constraint are explicitly computed on this subspace. This lays the groundwork to target several particular solutions, such $k=1$ cosmology and black holes, which will serve as the subjects of forthcoming follow-up papers.</description>

      <title>Black holes and bits: A simple path to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein discovered that black holes have entropy, which became one of the greatest scientific revolutions of the second half of the 20th century. The objective of this paper is to present a simple derivation -- partly heuristic and partly geometric -- of the equation for the entropy of a black hole, which we now know as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We will also briefly explore the physical implications of this equation and its relationship to the work of Stephen Hawking.</description>

      <title>Gravitational decoherence and recoherence of a composite particle: the interplay between gravitons and a classical Newtonian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that gravitational environments cannot be shielded (since gravity is universal) makes them of great theoretical interest to decoherence mechanisms and to the quantum-to-classical transition. While past results seemed to indicate that graviton-induced decoherence of spatial superpositions happens only for macroscopic systems, recently it was shown that this mechanism can be enhanced through the system's own dynamical internal structure. In this work, we extend this analysis by including the interaction with a classical Newtonian potential. We show that, although the graviton bath alone dominates the mechanism for short times compared to a timescale established by the size of the quantum spatial superposition, the interplay between the gravitons and the internal degrees of freedom of the system renders decoherence inevitable in the long-time limit, even for microscopic masses. We also show that this mechanism is slightly slowed down by the interplay with the classical Newtonian potential, which, for systems without dynamical internal degrees of freedom, can even lead to recoherence, at least in principle.</description>

      <title>Shadows of Giants: Constraints on Stupendously Large Black Holes from Negative Sources against the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stupendously large astrophysical black holes (SLABs) are hypothetical black holes with masses of more than a trillion Suns. Because observable consequences of their existence have only recently been seriously considered, there have been relatively few constraints on their abundance. This work motivates a simple yet powerful constraint on SLABs: their huge shadows are visible against the cosmic microwave background. SLABs could thus appear as negative sources in microwave data. In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\gtrsim 10^{17}\ M_{\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $\Omega_{BH} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$--$10^{18}\ M_{\odot}$. I also discuss the effects of accretion and their implications for the limits: SLAB growth, positive accretion luminosity, and obscuring material.</description>

      <title>Effective Repulsive Action of Gravitational Quantum Superpositions Under Postselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic feature of gravity is that it is an attractive force. If a source mass is prepared in a localized (classical- like) state, it will cause another probe mass to move towards it. Here we consider the situation in which a source mass is prepared in a quantum superposition of distinct spatial states while a probe mass interacts with it. Conditional on the detection of the source mass in a specific state, the probe mass will be found to move away from the source mass (repulsion). This signifies the quantum superposition of gravitational forces acting on the probe mass and thereby the fact that spacetime can exist in quantum superpositions. The technique used is the repulsive effect arising from an anomalous negative weak value. A potential experimental implementation with spin bearing nanocrystals is outlined.</description>

      <title>Geodesic equation in noncommutative space: a field theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the geodesic equation for point particles propagating in Moyal-type noncommutative spacetimes using a field-theoretic approach based on the quasi-classical limit of the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation. Starting from a twisted-geometric construction of the covariant Laplace-Beltrami operator, we obtain the noncommutative Hamilton-Jacobi equation and show that all noncommutative effects are absorbed into an effective, position-dependent mass function $M(x)$ appearing in an otherwise standard relativistic dispersion relation. The corresponding particle dynamics then acquires an additional term in the geodesic equation that takes the form of a fixed external force $F_{\text{NC}}^\mu = -\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu M^2(x)$, sourced entirely by the quantum nature of spacetime. We compute this effective mass perturbatively up to fourth order in the noncommutativity parameter for a general metric, proving that all odd-order corrections vanish identically. For the specific case of an $(r-\theta)$ twist applied to spherically symmetric backgrounds, we obtain explicit expressions demonstrating that the leading correction to geodesic motion appears at $\Theta^2$ order and is proportional to the probe particle's mass, while massless particles remain unaffected.</description>

      <title>Black hole Limits Redefined: Extreme Efficiency in Black Hole Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from black holes can extract energy not only from accretion but also directly from the black hole's spin, as described by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. A longstanding question is whether magnetic flux can accumulate near the event horizon to such an extent that it halts accretion entirely, enabling energy extraction purely from spin. Previous studies have shown that accretion persists through instabilities and that jet power only modestly exceeds the accretion energy budget, yet some observational results suggest much higher efficiencies. Here we present state-of-the-art general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that sustain a quasi-steady magnetically arrested disk state for approximately 10,000 dynamical times, during which accretion is globally suppressed across the full azimuthal extent. In this regime, jet power exceeds the accretion energy input by more than two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a previously unachieved level of efficiency. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the limits of black hole energy extraction and suggest a new framework for interpreting powerful jet systems. Our findings raise important questions about the long-term stability of such states and the fundamental limits of the Blandford-Znajek process.</description>

      <title>Redshift evolution of the Hubble constant: Constraints and new insights from an interacting dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a modified interacting dark energy (IDE) model to study the redshift evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), in light of the Hubble tension. In this framework, the energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence of $H_0$. We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $\alpha = 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Lorentz-covariant spectral universality for stationary stochastic fields in Minkowski spacetime. We show that no covariant local mapping can relate temporal and spatial power spectra in more than one spatial dimension. For Lorentz homogeneous spectra, the temporal index is symmetry protected, observer invariant, and offset from the spatial index by a universal geometric factor set by effective momentum space dimensionality. We show how spectral universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion dominated spectra, establishing the necessity of a Lorentz-covariant formulation of relativistic spectral inference.</description>

      <title>The Axion-Photon Mixing and the Extragalactic Magnetic Background: Plateau Regimes, Resonances, and Non-Gaussian Boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical treatment of Axion-Like-Particle (ALP)--photon mixing with extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation for constant, Gaussian-stochastic, and non-Gaussian magnetic field configurations--with direct implications for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations such as LHAASO, HAWC, and CTA experiments. For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields--critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Analogue many-body gravitating quantum systems with a network of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational probes of the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity in the Newtonian regime -- via mass-energy equivalence in clocks or spatial superpositions in interferometers -- share a common description in terms of an effective qubit-qubit Ising coupling. Here we generalize both paradigms to interacting $(N+1)$-level effective qudits made of atomic ensembles with particle number, $N$. The many-body enhancement boosts the signal-to-noise and increases the effective interaction rate, facilitating the observation of gravitationally induced entanglement and decoherence, certified by metrological witnesses based on local and collective measurements. Furthermore, we show that quantum effects induced by gravitational interaction can be simulated by trapped bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range (e.g. dipolar) coupling, providing a programmable analogue platform to explore gravitating quantum dynamics at accessible time and energy scales. Finally, extending the protocol to a sensor network broadens the entanglement-detection window.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of tensor perturbation in Kaluza-Klein black hole for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the tensor perturbation for the so-called Maeda-Dadhich black hole which locally has a topology $\mathcal{M}^n \simeq M^4 \times \mathcal{K}^{n-4}$. Our discussion is based on the tensor perturbation equation derived in~\cite{Cao:2021sty}, where the Kodama-Ishibashi gauge invariant formalism for Einstein gravity theory has been generalized to the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory. With the help of characteristic tensors for the constant curvature space $\mathcal{K}^{n-4}$, we investigate the effect of extra dimensions and obtain the scalar equation in four dimensional spacetime, which is quite different from the Klein-Gordon equation. Using the asymptotic iteration method and the numerical integration method with the Kumaresan-Tufts frequency extraction method, we numerically calculate the QNM frequencies. In our setups, characteristic frequencies depend on six distinct factors. They are the spacetime dimension $n$, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$, the black hole mass parameter $\mu$, the black hole charge parameter $q$, and two ``quantum numbers" $l$, $\gamma$. Without loss of generality, the impact of each parameter on the characteristic frequencies is investigated while fixing other five parameters. Interestingly, the dimension of compactification part has no significant impact on the lifetime of QNMs.</description>

      <title>Analytic weak-signal approximation of the Bayes factor for continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the targeted $\mathcal{B}$-statistic for continuous gravitational waves by modeling the $h_0$-prior as a half-Gaussian distribution with scale parameter $H$. This approach retains analytic tractability for two of the four amplitude marginalization integrals and recovers the standard $\mathcal{B}$-statistic in the strong-signal limit ($H\rightarrow\infty$). By Taylor-expanding the weak-signal regime ($H\rightarrow0$), the new prior enables fully analytic amplitude marginalization, resulting in a simple, explicit statistic that is as computationally efficient as the maximum-likelihood $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, but significantly more robust. Numerical tests show that for day-long coherent searches, the weak-signal Bayes factor achieves sensitivities comparable to the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, though marginally lower than the standard $\mathcal{B}$-statistic (and the Bero-Whelan approximation). In semi-coherent searches over short (compared to a day) segments, this approximation matches or outperforms the weighted dominant-response $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ABw}}$-statistic and returns to the sensitivity of the (weighted) $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{w}}$-statistic for longer segments. Overall the new Bayes-factor approximation demonstrates state-of-the-art or improved sensitivity across a wide range of segment lengths we tested (from 900s to 10days).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrahigh-frequency (above 10 kHz) gravitational waves (GW) window provides a unique opportunity to detect primordial GWs, free from astrophysical foregrounds that dominate lower frequencies. A stochastic GW background in this range is generically predicted from cosmological phase transitions and topological defects associated with grand unification and other ultra-high energy theories. We establish a universal quantum limit framework for various detection schemes, setting a fundamental bound on GW detectability. Our analysis reveals that backgrounds in the kHz-MHz range are in principle observable, whereas higher-frequency signals lie below the quantum limit. These results offer theoretical guidance for future detector designs and open new avenues for probing early universe physics.</description>

Abstract: We present the full Hamiltonian analysis of electrodynamics, including fermions, photons, and their interaction, on a general curved spacetime in Ashtekar-Barbero variables. Only the time gauge is imposed and the theory is background independent. The details of the constraints of the theory for fermionic and electromagnetic fields coupled to gravity are presented. Moreover, the equations of motion are derived and it is shown that they reduce to the Dirac equation, Maxwell equation and their interaction term in curved or flat spacetime in the appropriate limits. Finally, the behavior of the theory under parity transformation is analyzed. This result presents a suitable foundation for loop or polymer quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. We show that the angular momentum accretion rate decreases the absolute value of the black hole spin parameter. It is also found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. We provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the temperature of the McVittie black holes in cavities. The cavities are isothermal boxes that can make the McVittie black holes thermodynamically stable. The McVittie black holes are dynamical black holes, so the traditional action method can hardly be used to calculate the cavity temperature. We find that the cavity temperature $T_c$ can be derived from the McVittie black hole temperature $T_+$ and the Tolman relation. By setting $H^2$ to be $\Lambda/3$, we also get the cavity temperature of de Sitter black holes, which are interestingly the same with the results from the action method, but our method is much more easier.</description>

      <title>Resonance in black hole ringdown: Benchmarking quasinormal mode excitation and extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce quasinormal mode excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques, providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for applications to observational data analysis.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Superradiance of Interacting Multi-Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate black hole superradiance evolution of the interacting multiple fields. We consider a model of two scalar fields interacting with a cubic coupling, and study the superradiant evolution of the cloud. We demonstrate that superradiance is typically suppressed when the superradiant field couples to another field, even with a very weak coupling strength. This implies that the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we review the well known ambiguity in defining angular momentum (and mass dipole) fluxes in general relativity and we reinterpret recent works that resolve the ambiguity by defining invariant charges. We resolve the ambiguity by finding the conditions that fix a frame for supertranslation and for space-time translation. We also present an elementary method for measuring the angular momentum aspect and work out explicitly the supertranslation frame-fixing conditions for the metric created by point particles to first nontrivial order in the Newton constant.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon ring structure of reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole. This wormhole, built in the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a junction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on each side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at different locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to the observer's screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the space-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered there. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric wormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with either one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich multi-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong reduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new rings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the single-disk case, and the shadow's size reduction far more acute, making a neat distinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight the potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the existence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their multi-ring structure.</description>

      <title>Off-Equatorial Orbits around Magnetically Charged Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of stable, off-equatorial circular orbits around magnetically charged black holes (MBHs). For a static, spherically symmetric MBH, we derive an exact analytic expression for the orbital latitude theta as a function of radius r and we analyze the effect of synchrotron radiation. We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime. Our results suggest that environments surrounding magnetically charged black holes can exhibit distinctive phenomenological signatures, potentially offering a way to constrain the magnetic charge of astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in semi-open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in semi-open systems by using the Heun functions. For the semi-open system, a partially reflective wall is added around the event horizon. Three aspects of this model are investigated, namely the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra, the greybody factor (GF), and the exceptional point (EP). For the QNM aspect, we identify three distinct behaviors as the frequency-independent reflectivity $\mathcal{K}$ increasing. The first-type modes approach the real axis and form long-lived quasi-bound states. The second-type modes move toward but do not reach the real axis and retain a finite decay rate. The third-type modes eventually lie on the imaginary axis becoming purely decaying modes. For the GF aspect, GFs exhibit strong oscillations controlled by the distance between the potential and the reflective wall with a real constant reflectivity. In contrast, a Boltzmann-type reflectivity produces only small corrections. Finally, by promoting $\mathcal{K}$ to a complex parameter, the modified boundary conditions give rise to a second-order EP. Parameterizing the vicinity of such EP, we observe the mode exchange phenomenon, and the deviation of spectra scale with the square root of the deviation of the parameter, as predicted by a Puiseux series expansion.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in Dust-Radiation Bouncing Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe and may have an enhanced abundance in bouncing cosmologies, where a long contracting phase can amplify perturbations. We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(\zeta_c \sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Fan-Wang type regular black holes in Quasi-Topological Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Inertial Frame Dragging as a Probe to Differentiate Kerr-Newman Naked Singularities from Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate inertial frame dragging and relativistic precession in the Kerr--Newman spacetime and show how gyroscopic observables can operationally discriminate between Kerr--Newman black holes and Kerr--Newman naked singularities. We study a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer and derive closed-form expressions for the Lense--Thirring, geodetic, and general spin-precession frequencies. A sharp qualitative distinction emerges: for Kerr--Newman black holes, the spin-precession frequency generically diverges as the horizon is approached (remaining finite only for the ZAMO family), whereas for Kerr--Newman naked singularities, the precession remains finite throughout the spacetime, with divergences confined to the ring singularity on the equatorial plane. Working with physically admissible stationary observers (including ZAMOs), we first construct the timelike geodesic motion and the fundamental orbital frequencies for equatorial circular orbits. Using these, we analyse the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, the ISCO shift induced by the charge parameter $Q$, and the associated periastron and nodal precession frequencies relevant to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We demonstrate that nonzero $Q$ produces systematic, and in rapidly rotating regimes nontrivial, modifications to the frequency hierarchy: $\nu_{\rm nod}$ can develop a finite maximum at $r=r_p=\mathcal{O}(M)$, its peak amplitude decreases with increasing $Q$, and sign reversals may occur for sufficiently large charge and high spin, signalling a reversal of nodal-precession orientation. These results establish spin-precession behaviour as a robust strong-field probe of horizons versus exposed singularities, with potential implications for testing cosmic censorship using future high-precision precession/QPO measurements.</description>

Abstract: We study a particular exact solution for rotating spacetimes in four-dimensional Horava gravity, which has been proposed as a renormalizable gravity model without the ghost problem. We show that the zero-mass Kerr spacetime or the zero-mass Kerr-(A)dS spacetime in Einstein gravity is an exact solution in four-dimensional Horava for an arbitrary IR Lorentz-violation parameter lambda, but with an appropriate cosmological constant. In particular, for the zero-mass topological Kerr-AdS black hole solution with the hyperbolic horizon topology or the zero-mass Kerr-dS cosmological solution with the spherical horizon topology, there exist the ergosphere and the non-vanishing (positive) Hawking temperature, which imply the existence of negative mass black holes as well as positive mass spacetimes, by losing its mass from the zero-mass ones via the Hawking radiation or Penrose process in the ergosphere.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Potential Inflation in the ACT Era: From CMB to Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that logarithmically enhanced infra-red loop corrections arising in theories with four derivatives correspond to a physical running of couplings, rendering quadratic gravity asymptotically free. We find that these effects depend on the gauge and on the field parameterisation. We compute physical on-shell amplitudes and find genuine infra-red log-enhanced loop corrections, that are process-dependent and cannot be absorbed into running couplings. As a byproduct, we derive the effective action of quadratic gravity at tree level, showing that its ghost does not contribute to effective operators and thereby does not violate positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained through our nonlinear causality approach.</description>

      <title>Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for r-process elements in the Universe. However, various lines of evidence, including observations of r-process abundances inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this paper, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic Eu/Fe versus Fe/H abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to r-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. Our analysis employs a unified, likelihood-based inference framework that consistently propagates uncertainties in merger rates, delay-time distributions, mass- and spin-dependent ejecta yields, and stellar abundance measurements. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast- merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic r-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non- merger production channels.</description>

      <title>Four-charge static non-extremal black holes in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$, $STU-W^2U$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Deforming the Double-Scaled SYK &amp; Reaching the Stretched Horizon From Finite Cutoff Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model under chord Hamiltonian deformations based on finite cutoff holography for general dilaton gravity theories with Dirichlet boundaries. The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}(+\Lambda_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\Lambda_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting Krylov complexity for the Hartle-Hawking state represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the growth of Krylov complexity; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras of the DSSYK model for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. By performing a sequence of $T^2$ and $T^2+\Lambda_1$ deformations in the upper tail of the energy spectrum in the deformed DSSYK, we concretely realize the cosmological stretched horizon proposal in de Sitter holography by Susskind. We discuss other extensions with sine dilaton gravity, end-of-the-world branes, and the Almheiri-Goel-Hu model.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov analysis of pulsar TOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of the degree of randomness of signals was used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars were analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enabled us to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e., pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time dependence of the randomness in the white noise was also studied, indicating the existence of nonstationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP is thus acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.</description>
