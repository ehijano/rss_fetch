      <title>PRISM: A MATLAB-Based Application for Structured Probe Data Management and Visualization in Tokamak Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful operation of tokamak experiments requires accurate documentation, tracking, and visualization of diagnostic instruments, particularly electrical probes. Traditionally, this metadata is maintained manually through handwritten logbooks or semi-digital spreadsheets, leading to inefficiencies and human errors. In response to these challenges, we present PRISM (Probe Registration and Information System for Monitoring)-a MATLAB-based application developed using App Designer. PRISM provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates structured probe registration, metadata storage, and both 2D and 3D spatial visualization in tokamak geometries. Tested with data from the ADITYA-U tokamak, PRISM helps users enter information accurately, retrieve metadata easily, and visualize probe setups. The tool is built in a flexible way, is not limited to a specific setup, and could potentially support future developments such as digital twins and real-time control systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Time-Integrated Diagnosis of Laser-Heated Deuterium Ions in Dense Plasma via Fusion Neutron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrashort time-integrated diagnosis of ions plays a vital role in high energy density physics research. However, it is extremely challenging to measure in experiment. Here, we demonstrate a reliable approach for investigating the dynamics of deuterium ions in dense plasma. By irradiating a heavy water stream with the hundred Hertz repetitive intense femtosecond laser pulses, the neutrons from D(D,n)3He reaction can be detected via a single Time-of-Flight detector to accumulate the spectrum with a fine energy-resolution. This spectrum has been utilized to calculate the temperature and angular distribution of deuterium ions transported in plasma. And the calculated results are well verified by particle-in-cell simulations of deuterium ions dynamics. Our method paves a new way for diagnosing ions picoseconds time-integrated dynamics in plasma and holds great potential for understanding the ions transport process in high-energy density matters and studying laser plasma ion acceleration.</description>

      <title>Local extraction of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection X-lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the most important magnetic energy conversion processes observed in laboratory and space plasmas. It describes the breaking and joining of magnetic field lines, leading to the release of magnetic energy and the acceleration of charged particles. Finding regions where fast reconnection occurs is key to understanding this process. However, identifying such reconnection events within a turbulent environment in three dimensions remains a challenge. In this work, we develop a new framework for identifying magnetic reconnection using 3D turbulent plasma simulations. First, we apply bifurcation lines from fluid visualization to magnetic fields and show that they can be identified with X-lines of magnetic reconnection. For reconnection configurations with magnetic guide fields, we introduce a novel concept of quasi X-lines (QXL). Using the spatial information of X-lines in numerical simulations, we present a local technique to estimate the reconnection rate, obtaining a distribution that features a local maximum near the normalized value 0.1. Additionally, we provide an alternative tool to highlight current sheets in turbulent plasma by measuring magnetic shear layers as the second invariant of the shear strain tensor. These methods, avoiding traditional reliance on global methods, electric fields and current density, offer a new perspective to the quantitative study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with complex magnetic field topologies. Validated across various plasma simulation models, including kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), our approach enables efficient exploration of magnetic field dynamics in turbulent plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-diagnostic characterization of inductively coupled discharges with tailored waveform substrate bias for precise control of plasma etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of ion energy distribution functions (IEDF) is crucial for selectivity as well as control over sputter rate and substrate damage in nanoscale plasma processes. In this work, a low frequency (100 kHz) tailored pulse-wave-shaped bias voltage waveform is applied to the substrate electrode of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and its effects on the IEDF, electron density, electron dynamics and the etch rates of silicon dioxide as well as amorphous silicon are investigated in a commercial 200 mm reactive ion etching (RIE) reactor. While the tailored waveform substrate bias hardly affects the electron density above the substrate and the spatio-temporally resolved electron power absorption dynamics, it is found to affect the ion flux to the substrate at high ICP source powers. Monoenergetic IEDFs with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) below 10 eV are realized with mean ion energies ranging from 20 eV to 100 eV in both argon and SF6. Such monoenergetic IEDFs are used to determine the Ar ion sputter threshold energies of amorphous silicon and silicon dioxide to be 23 eV and 37 eV, respectively, and to realize selective etching of these two materials by Ar ion sputtering based on tailoring the IEDF to ensure that all incident ions are within this narrow ion energy selectivity window.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare various models for describing the phase transition of the fluid hydrogen into a conducting state, including both chemical models of plasma and first-principle simulations within the framework of the density functional theory (DFT). The comparison of the results indicates the plasma nature of the phase transition in warm dense hydrogen. We propose a concept of a new class of first-order phase transitions: ionization or dissociation-driven phase transitions, with which the plasma phase transition in fluid hydrogen can be associated.</description>

      <title>Effects of reversed magnetic shear on the plasma rotation stabilization of resistive wall modes in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of reversed magnetic shear on the plasma rotation stabilization of resistive wall modes in tokamaks are investigated using the AEGIS code. MHD equilibria in toroidal configuration from circular cross-sections to realistic CFETR-like scenarios with various magnetic shear profiles are considered. Two critical aspects of the $n=1$ RWM are examined: the influence of toroidal rotation on the unstable regime and the toroidal rotation frequency thresholds required for complete stabilization. It is found that strongly reversed magnetic shear consistently broadens the unstable $\beta_{\rm N}$ window in both circular and CFETR equilibria when toroidal rotation is included. Furthermore, reversed magnetic shear significantly reduces the rotational stabilization, resulting in narrower stability windows and notably higher toroidal rotation frequency thresholds required for complete RWM suppression compared to the cases with positive shear only. These results clearly demonstrate that the reversed magnetic shear in the advanced tokamak configuration imposes more stringent requirement for the effective toroidal rotation stabilization of the $n=1$ RWM.</description>

      <title>Forward and Backward Electron Acceleration by Radially Polarized Ultra-Intense Laser Focus Seeded By Field Ionization of High Charge States of Neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the fabrication of large aperture phase optics, ultra-intense relativistic laser plasma interaction (RLPI) experiments with complex polarization states are becoming feasible. In this work, we perform a computational investigation of direct acceleration of electrons produced during ionization of underdense neon gas using a tightly focused and radially polarized Petawatt-class short pulse lasers by numerically solving the relativistically invariant Lorentz equations, incorporating semi-classical tunneling ionization and Monte Carlo type sampling of the focal volume. The accelerated electrons energy gain increases at longer laser wavelengths and GeV energies are reached for electrons ionized from the neon inner shells, which are field ionized near the peak of the pulse. Backward acceleration of electrons is observed for a range of initial positions and phases of ionization of neon charge states. This apparent counterintuitive phenomenon is directly linked to the radial polarization state of the incident laser beam that results in a strong longitudinal electric field Ez when tightly focused, where electrons ionized near the focal center at the phase when Ez is pointed toward the forward propagation direction experiences an initial push in the backward direction. A parametric study of the phenomenon by varying laser parameters is presented, and a 3D particle in cell (PIC) simulation is considered to confirm the existence of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Applicability of Emulated Virtual Circuits for Tokamak Plasma Shape Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Amp\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Hot-Ion Modes in Globus-M2 and Saturation of Energy Confinement Time Scaling in Spherical Tokamaks with Toroidal Magnetic Field of 1 T and Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a small spherical tokamak with minor radius of 0.22 m and toroidal magnetic field of 1 T, it is possible to heat ions of a sufficiently dense plasma to an extremely high temperature up to 50 million Kelvin. To do this, it is necessary to transfer a sufficiently large torque to stabilize ion-scale turbulence and achieve ion heat transport at neoclassical level reaching extremely low values of plasma collisionality. It is also necessary to ensure good thermal insulation of electrons, which is always determined by turbulent transport. In a spherical tokamak, the toroidal magnetic field has a strong beneficial effect on suppressing turbulent electron heat fluxes. In the Globus-M2 tokamak, when heating plasma with high-energy atomic beams, a significant improvement in the plasma thermal energy confinement is observed with an increase in the toroidal magnetic field from 0.5 to 1 T. The comparison of our results with experiments on ST40 tokamak operating with toroidal magnetic field of 2 T indicates that further strong improvement of thermal insulation of spherical tokamak plasma in the region of higher magnetic fields is not expected.</description>

      <title>One--Component Plasma Equation of State Revisited via Angular--Averaged Ewald Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytic fits of classical one--component plasma (OCP) internal energy over a wide range of coupling parameter $0.01\le\Gamma\le 170$ using Monte--Carlo data in the thermodynamic limit. We extend the dataset obtained in [Demyanov and Levashov, Phys. Rev. E 106, 015204 (2022)] using the angular--averaged Ewald potential with additional points at strong coupling ($\Gamma=120,\ 150,\ 170$). We then fit two frequently used functional forms for the OCP equation of state: (i) a five-parameter equation by Caillol [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 6538--6547 (1999)] and (ii) the equation by Potekhin and Chabrier [Phys. Rev. E 62, 8554 (2000)] that enforces the Debye--H\"uckel limit. The presented fits reproduce our MC data within statistical uncertainties, recovering the correct weak-coupling behavior. Coefficients, recommended validity ranges, and comparisons to prior analytical and simulation results are provided.</description>

      <title>SOLPS-ITER Numerical Simulations of ITER-scale Snowflake Divertors: Low-Field-Side SF-/SF+ and High-Field-Side SF-/SF+ Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With edge plasma code SOLS-ITER, we study four Snowflake (SF) configurations for an ITER-size tokamak, with toroidal magnetic field BT=5T, major radius R=5m and plasma current Ip=10MA. Our aim is to provide insights on SF divertor design for future devices. In this work, the impacts of magnetic geometry and divertor target geometry in the four types of SF configurations on plasma behavior and power exhaust performance are investigated in detail. Low-recycling regime, high-recycling and detachment in the four types of SF divertors are obtained through an upstream density scan. The secondary X-point positions of SF divertors are systematically varied to examine their impact. For Low-Field-Side (LFS) SF- and High-Field-Side (HFS) SF- divertors the observed power splitting, induced by the secondary X-point, is consistent with experimental observations. The effect of target geometry is studied by comparing the flat target plates with the ITER-like divertor shape. The overall simulation results reveal a notable consequence of the LFS SF- divertor: closed structure of the inner target with high inclined plate can compress recycling neutrals originating from the HFS divertor region into the LFS SOL and PFR regions. This results in considerable volumetric dissipation through strong ionization and recombination, causing the connected outer target region to detach. This feature can be considered in the design of the LFS SF- divertor for future devices. For the LFS and HFS SF+ divertors, the region between the two X-points exhibits strong ionization and recombination sources close to the primary X-point. This feature might be beneficial for the formation of an X-point radiator, but would require further impurity seeding simulation study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divertor targets in magnetic confinement fusion devices must be designed to handle extreme heat loads. Fast approximation of heat loads with FLARE based on field line reconstruction from an unstructured flux tube mesh is utilized in particle swarm optimization (PSO) of the divertor target geometry. Optimization of the outer divertor target in ITER is evaluated with a constraint for the head loads onto baffles. The optimal configuration is found to depend on assumptions for the background plasma in the heat load proxy simulation.</description>

      <title>Corrections to radiative rates between atomic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of radiative opacity or emissivity of hot dense matter is a challenging task. It requires accounting for an immense number of energy levels and lines across various excitation and ionization states. Whether in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or non-LTE plasmas, statistical methods provide significant assistance. Many computational codes are based on the Detailed Configuration Accounting approximation, which involves averaged rates between configurations. In that approach, only the mean energies of the configurations are considered, and the effects of the energy distributions of the levels within the initial and final configurations are typically neglected. A long time ago, Klapisch proposed a method to correct the rates. The corresponding formalism includes the energy shift and variance of the Unresolved Transition Array, as well as the average energies of the configurations. We extend this formalism and investigate its impact on opacity calculations in two specific cases: first, the iron experiment conducted at Sandia National Laboratories under conditions similar to those at the base of the Sun's convective zone, dominated by L-shell 2p-$n$d transitions, and second, laser experiments--still for iron--at much lower temperature. The latter measurements shed light on our understanding of the envelopes of $\beta$-Cephei-type stars, where the relevant transitions are intra-M-shell $\Delta n=0$ (3-3) transitions, specifically 3s-3p and 3p-3d, in the XUV range. The issue of ensuring the validity of Kirchhoff's law when plasmas approach LTE is also addressed, and a prescription is proposed, applying both to the standard configuration-to-configuration case and to the aforementioned corrections, which account for the energy distribution of the levels within a configuration.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Ion Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes that the ion temperature is several times the local electron temperature in the hot onset phase and at the above-the-loop region of solar flares. The paper considers: the evidence of spectral line Doppler widths ("non-thermal" broadening); evidence for "universal" ion and electron temperature increase scaling relations for magnetic reconnection in the solar wind, Earth's magnetopause, Earth's magnetotail and numerical simulations; and thermal equilibration times for onset and above-the-loop densities, which are much longer than previous estimates based on soft X-ray flare loops. We conclude that the ion temperature is likely to reach 60 MK or greater and that it may represent a substantial part of spectral line widths, significantly contributing to solving the long-standing issue of the excess nonthermal broadening in flare lines.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a tandem lens for producing shaped laser-ionized plasmas for plasma wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a tandem lens optical setup, comprising two diffractive optics, that focuses a high-power ultrafast laser with a shaped on-axis intensity profile, producing a meter-long Bessel focus. The intended use of the optical setup is to produce a laser-ionized plasma source for plasma wakefield acceleration. By controlling the on-axis intensity, the density profile of the plasma ramps at the entrance and exit of the plasma can be tailored to optimize matching of the electron beam into the plasma. In addition to demonstrating the optical system, we describe the algorithm used to calculate the lens phases and present detailed calculations of the lenses' expected performance.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation by radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an investigation of second harmonic generation (SHG) resulting from interaction of radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous, unmagnetized plasma. Lorentz force and continuity equations have been used to derive the radial and axial current density components. Further, using these densities in the wave equation leads to analytical expressions for the SHG field amplitudes. These amplitudes exhibit periodic oscillations along the propagation axis, characterized by detuning length dependent on plasma density and laser parameters. Radial and axial contributions to SHG are found to be highly enhanced near the beam axis due to the Gaussian beam profile of the laser. The analytical findings are validated using Fourier Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulations. Notably, unlike linearly or circularly polarized beams which require either inhomogeneous or magnetized plasma, radially polarized beams facilitate efficient harmonic generation in homogeneous unmagnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Core and Edge Mechanisms of the Density Limit in DIII-D Negative Triangularity Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density limit is investigated in the DIII-D negative triangularity (NT) plasmas which lack a standard H-mode edge. We find the limit may not be a singular disruptive boundary but a multifaceted density saturation phenomenon governed by distinct core and edge transport mechanisms. Sustained, non-disruptive operation is achieved at densities up to 1.8 times the Greenwald limit ($n_\mathrm{G}$) until the termination of auxiliary heating. Systematic power scans reveal distinct power scalings for the core ($n_e \propto P_\mathrm{SOL}^{0.27\pm0.03}$) and edge ($n_e \propto P_\mathrm{SOL}^{0.42\pm0.04}$) density limits. The edge density saturation is triggered abruptly by the onset of a non-disruptive, high-field side radiative instability that clamps the edge density below $n_\mathrm{G}$. In contrast, the core density continues to rise until it saturates, a state characterized by substantially enhanced core turbulence. Core transport evolves from a diffusive to an intermittent, avalanche-like state, as indicated by heavy-tailed probability density functions (kurtosis $\approx 6$), elevated Hurst exponents, and a $1/f$-type power spectrum. These findings suggest that the density limit in the low-confinement regime is determined by a combination of edge radiative instabilities and core turbulent transport. This distinction provides separate targets for control strategies aimed at extending the operational space of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>The Dielectric Response of Plasmas with Arbitrary Gyrotropic Velocity Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot and tenuous plasmas are frequently far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, necessitating sophisticated methods for determining the associated plasma dielectric tensor and normal mode response. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (\texttt{alps}) is a numerical tool for calculating such responses of plasmas with arbitrary gyrotropic background velocity distribution functions (VDFs). In order to model weakly and moderately damped plasma waves accurately, we have updated to the code to use an improved analytic continuation enabled by a polynomial basis representation. We demonstrate the continuity of solutions to the linear Vlasov--Maxwell dispersion relation between bi-Maxwellian and arbitrary VDF representations and evaluate the influence of VDF structure on mode polarization and wave power emission and absorption.</description>

      <title>A low-cost plasma source aimed for medical applications using Ar as the working gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to advances in equipment and intense research on plasma biomedical applications over the past few years, plasma devices are now suitable for clinical use. It has been demonstrated that plasma sources can be designed in a way that ensures their safe operation and application whilst preserving the relevant clinical results. However, the manufacturing and operating costs of such plasma devices remain high, which can be decisive for their adoption in medical procedures. In this work, a simple modification of a low-cost plasma jet configuration is proposed in order to evaluate the device's viability for medical applications using argon as working gas. Typically, plasma jets operating with argon (Ar) generate high electrical currents, which makes them unsuitable for medical applications. With the proposed device modification, the treatment is no longer carried out using the plasma jet directly, but rather with the post-discharge effluent enriched with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As a result, the electrical current reaching the target remains below the safety threshold established for plasma applications in humans. Tests on water activation by plasma jets with and without the proposed modification indicate that both devices can yield comparable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.
  Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.
  In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Isotope Enrichment and Element Separation by Self Generated Magnetic Centrifuge Fields in Ultrafast Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.</description>

      <title>Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and resonant ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity. We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate- and Extremely High-Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- to 5+ and 6- to 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm that emphasizes input parameters with the highest variance during training and identifies the most significant ones influencing the outputs based on a computed metric called "potentiality". We focus on the dependence of solar wind plasma density on moderate-geomagnetic conditions. It has been unclear from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL extracted solar wind velocity as the predominant parameter at extremely low (0 to 1+) and high-Kp ranges under southward IMF. In this study, the IMF three components, solar wind speed, and plasma density from the OMNI database (1998-2019), covering solar cycle 23 to early 25, were used as inputs. Again, PL selected solar wind velocity as the most significant parameter for moderate and extremely high Kp. The potentiality of solar wind density for these ranges was, however, 3.5 times higher than in the previous study, suggesting its impact on geomagnetic activity cannot be ignored. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as PL inputs under all Kp levels. Above moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind if density is large, suggesting that not only velocity but also density contributes significantly. These PL and statistical investigations show that solar wind density begins to regulate Kp above moderate geomagnetic activity under southward IMF. They also help understand the relationship between solar wind and geomagnetic activity and forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Dynamics of Strongly Magnetized Ion-Electron Relativistic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.</description>
