      <title>Multi-Agent Disk Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $n$ unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk's perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent positioned outside the disk's interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For $n=1$, this problem is referred to as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell in 1957 derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for that problem. The one-agent version of the problem was originally proposed as a more tractable variant of Bellman's famous lost-in-the-forest problem.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, and as a warm-up, we extend Isbell's findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories addressing the partial inspection of a section of the disk, hence deriving an alternative proof of optimality for inspecting the disk with $n \geq 2$ agents. Second, we analyze the average-case inspection time, assuming a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms). Using spatial discretization and Nonlinear Programming (NLP), we propose feasible solutions to the continuous problem and evaluate their effectiveness compared to NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.</description>

      <title>Minimizing breaks by minimizing odd cycle transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a suitable schedule for sports competitions is a crucial issue in sports scheduling. The round-robin tournament is a competition adopted in many professional sports. For most round-robin tournaments, it is considered undesirable that a team plays consecutive away or home matches; such an occurrence is called a break. Accordingly, it is preferable to reduce the number of breaks in a tournament. A common approach is first to construct a schedule and then determine a home-away assignment based on the given schedule to minimize the number of breaks (first-schedule-then-break). In this study, we concentrate on the problem that arises in the second stage of the first-schedule-then-break approach, namely, the break minimization problem(BMP). We prove that this problem can be reduced to an odd cycle transversal problem, the well-studied graph problem. These results lead to a new approximation algorithm for the BMP.</description>

      <title>Algorithmics and Complexity of Cost-Driven Task Offloading with Submodular Optimization in Edge-Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as autonomous driving pose the challenge of efficient cost-driven offloading in edge-cloud environments. This involves assigning tasks to edge and cloud servers for separate execution, with the goal of minimizing the total service cost including communication and computation costs. In this paper, observing that the intra-cloud communication costs are relatively low and can often be neglected in many real-world applications, we consequently introduce the so-called communication assumption which posits that the intra-cloud communication costs are not higher than the inter-partition communication cost between cloud and edge servers, nor the cost among edge servers. As a preliminary analysis, we first prove that the offloading problem without the communication assumption is NP-hard, using a reduction from MAX-CUT. Then, we show that the offloading problem can be modeled as a submodular minimization problem, making it polynomially solvable. Moreover, this polynomial solvability remains even when additional constraints are imposed, such as when certain tasks must be executed on edge servers due to latency constraints. By combining both algorithmics and computational complexity results, we demonstrate that the difficulty of the offloading problem largely depends on whether the communication assumption is satisfied. Lastly, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its significant advantages over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach for Bent Functions with Dillon-like Exponents and Characterizing Three Classes of Bent Functions via Kloosterman Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dillon-like Boolean functions are known, in the literature, to be those trace polynomial functions from $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2n}}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{2}$, with all the exponents being multiples of $2^n-1$ often called Dillon-like exponents. This paper is devoted to bent functions in which we study the bentness of some classes of Dillon-like Boolean functions connected with rational trace functions. Specifically, we introduce a special infinite family of trace rational functions. We shall use these functions as building blocks and generalise notably a criterion due to Li et al. published in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59(3), pp. 1818-1831, 2013] on the bentness of Dillon-like functions in the binary case, we explicitly characterize three classes of bent functions. These characterizations are expressed in terms of the well-known binary Kloosterman sums. Furthermore, analysis and experiments indicate that new functions not EA-equivalent to all known classes of monomial functions are included in our classes.</description>

      <title>Finding hypergraph immersion is fixed-parameter tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersion minor is an important variant of graph minor, defined through an injective mapping from vertices in a smaller graph $H$ to vertices in a larger graph $G$ where adjacent elements of the former are connected in the latter by edge-disjoint paths. Here, we consider the immersion problem in the emerging field of hypergraphs. We first define hypergraph immersion by extending the injective mapping to hypergraphs. We then prove that finding a hypergraph immersion is fixed-parameter tractable, namely, there exists an $O(N^6)$ polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a fixed hypergraph $H$ can be immersed in a hypergraph $G$ with $N$ vertices. Additionally, we present the dual hypergraph immersion problem and provide further characteristics of the algorithmic complexity.</description>

      <title>Totally $\Delta$-modular IPs with two non-zeros in most rows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer programs (IPs) on constraint matrices with bounded subdeterminants are conjectured to be solvable in polynomial time. We give a strongly polynomial time algorithm to solve IPs where the constraint matrix has bounded subdeterminants and at most two non-zeros per row after removing a constant number of rows and columns. This result extends the work by Fiorini, Joret, Weltge \&amp; Yuditsky (J. ACM 2024) by allowing for additional, unifying constraints and variables.</description>

      <title>The Polymatroid Representation of a Greedoid, and Associated Galois Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The greedoid is a significant abstraction of the matroid allowing for a more flexible analysis of structures in which the greedy algorithm "works." However, their diverse structure imposes difficulties towards their application in combinatorial optimization [Sze21]. In response, we revisit the polymatroid greedoid [KL85a] to characterize it by properties approximating those of matroids, by using the submodularity of its polymatroid representation in particular. Towards doing so, our main contribution is a full description of this class. Specifically, we show that a greedoid is a polymatroid greedoid if and only if it is an optimistic interval greedoid whose kernels are closed under intersection. This constitutes the first necessary and sufficient characterization of the polymatroid greedoid in terms of its combinatorial attributes, thereby resolving a central open question of Korte and Lov\'asz [KL85a]. Here, we introduce the optimism property to approximate properties of a matroid's continuations which are implied by the closure axioms of its span, which no longer hold for greedoids. And, because the kernels of an interval greedoid are in many ways an extension of a matroid's closed sets, our direction of necessity is a direct generalization of Birkhoff and Edmond's characterization of the meet in the lattice of a matroid's closed sets [Bir35, Edm03]. Towards achieving this result, our main technical insights arise from relating the lattice of flats of a polymatroid greedoid to that of the closed sets of its representation through order preserving mappings. Specifically, we will show the novel insight that the notion of polymatroid representation considered in [KL85a] is equivalent to the existence of a certain Galois connection. As a consequence, the representation of a greedoid via a polymatroid is an order theoretic concept in disguise.</description>

      <title>Advances in Algorithmic Meta Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tractability results for the model checking problem of logics yield powerful algorithmic meta theorems of the form: Every computational problem expressible in a logic $L$ can be solved efficiently on every class $\mathscr{C}$ of structures satisfying certain conditions. The most prominent logics studied in the field are (counting) monadic second-order logic (C)MSO, and first-order logic FO and its extensions. The complexity of CMSO model checking in general and of FO model checking on monotone graph classes is very well understood. In recent years there has been a rapid and exciting development of new algorithmic meta theorems. On the one hand there has been major progress for FO model checking on hereditary graph classes. This progress was driven by the development of a combinatorial structure theory for the logically defined monadically stable and monadically dependent graph classes, as well as by the advent of the new width measure twinwidth. On the other hand, new algorithmic meta theorems for new logics with expressive power between FO and CMSO offer a new unifying view on methods like the irrelevant vertex technique and recursive understanding. In this paper we overview the recent advances in algorithmic meta theorems and provide rough sketches for the methods to prove them.</description>

      <title>Ordering groups and the Identity Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Identity Problem for certain groups, which asks if the subsemigroup generated by a given finite set of elements contains the identity element, is related to problems regarding ordered groups. Notably, the Identity Problem for a torsion-free nilpotent group corresponds to the problem asking if a given finite set of elements extends to the positive cone of a left-order on the group, and thereby also to the Word Problem for a related lattice-ordered group.
  A new (independent) proof is given showing that the Identity and Subgroup Problems are decidable for every finitely presented nilpotent group, establishing also the decidability of the Word Problem for a family of lattice-ordered groups. A related problem, the Fixed-Target Submonoid Membership Problem, is shown to be undecidable in nilpotent groups.
  Decidability of the Normal Identity Problem (with `subsemigroup' replaced by `normal subsemigroup') for free nilpotent groups is established using the (known) decidability of the Word Problem for certain lattice-ordered groups. Connections between orderability and the Identity Problem for a class of torsion-free metabelian groups are also explored.</description>

      <title>Cautious Optimizers: Improving Training with One Line of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searches for faster and more stable optimizers with only constraint positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a \textbf{single-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename Cautious Optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing speed-up on Llama and MAE pretraining up to $1.47\times$.

      <title>Bow Metrics and Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric was defined in (Dragan &amp; Ducoffe, 2023) as a far reaching generalization of an $\alpha_i$-metric (which is equivalent to a ($0,i$)-bow metric). A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to satisfy ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric if for every four vertices $u,v,w,x$ of $G$ the following holds: if two shortest paths $P(u,w)$ and $P(v,x)$ share a common shortest subpath $P(v,w)$ of length more than $\lambda$ (that is, they overlap by more than $\lambda$), then the distance between $u$ and $x$ is at least $d_G(u,v)+d_G(v,w)+d_G(w,x)-\mu$. ($\lambda,\mu$)-Bow metric can also be considered for all geodesic metric spaces. It was shown by Dragan &amp; Ducoffe that every $\delta$-hyperbolic graph (in fact, every $\delta$-hyperbolic geodesic metric space) satisfies ($\delta, 2\delta$)-bow metric. Thus, ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric is a common generalization of hyperbolicity and of $\alpha_i$-metric. In this paper, we investigate an intriguing question whether ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric implies hyperbolicity in graphs. Note that, this is not the case for general geodesic metric spaces as Euclidean spaces satisfy ($0,0$)-bow metric whereas they have unbounded hyperbolicity. We conjecture that, in graphs, ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric indeed implies hyperbolicity and show that our conjecture is true for several large families of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize mixed-level orthogonal arrays it terms of algebraic designs in a special multigraph. We prove a mixed-level analog of the Bierbrauer-Friedman (BF) bound for pure-level orthogonal arrays. For the case when the numbers of levels are powers of the same prime number, we characterize, in terms of multispreads, additive mixed-level orthogonal arrays attaining the BF bound. For pure-level orthogonal arrays, we consider versions of the BF bound obtained by replacing the Hamming graph by its polynomial generalization and show that in some cases this gives a new bound.
  Keywords: orthogonal array, algebraic $t$-design, mixed orthogonal array, completely-regular code, equitable partition, intriguing set, Hamming graph, Bierbrauer-Friedman bound, additive codes.</description>

Abstract: We study the discrete quantum walk that assigns negative identity coins to marked vertices and Grover coins to the unmarked ones. We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix. We then explore properties of this matrix when the marked vertices or unmarked vertices are neighborhood-equitable in the vertex-deleted subgraph.</description>

Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, however in case $r=2$ it was estimated only as $O(n^2)$. Here we apply a new approach, based on explicit basis expansion and weighted rectangles summation, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Graph Parameters, Universal Obstructions, and WQO</title>

Abstract: We establish a parametric framework for obtaining obstruction characterizations of graph parameters with respect to a quasi-ordering $\leqslant$ on graphs. At the center of this framework lies the concept of a $\leqslant$-parametric graph: a non $\leqslant$-decreasing sequence $\mathscr{G} = \langle \mathscr{G}_{t} \rangle_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ of graphs indexed by non-negative integers. Parametric graphs allow us to define combinatorial objects that capture the approximate behaviour of graph parameters. A finite set $\mathfrak{G}$ of $\leqslant$-parametric graphs is a $\leqslant$-universal obstruction for a parameter $\mathsf{p}$ if there exists a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and every graph $G$, 1) if $\mathsf{p}(G) \leq k$, then for every $\mathscr{G} \in \mathfrak{G},$ $\mathscr{G}_{f(k)} \not\leqslant G$, and 2) if for every $\mathscr{G} \in \mathfrak{G},$ $\mathscr{G}_{k} \not\leqslant G$, then $\mathsf{p}(G) \leq f(k).$ To solidify our point of view, we identify sufficient order-theoretic conditions that guarantee the existence of universal obstructions and in this case we examine algorithmic implications on the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. Our parametric framework has further implications related to finite obstruction characterizations of properties of graph classes. A $\leqslant$-class property is defined as any set of $\leqslant$-closed graph classes that is closed under set inclusion. By combining our parametric framework with established results from order theory, we derive a precise order-theoretic characterization that ensures $\leqslant$-class properties can be described in terms of the exclusion of a finite set of $\leqslant$-parametric graphs.</description>

      <title>Regular packing of rooted hyperforests with root constraints in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The seminal papers of Edmonds \cite{Egy}, Nash-Williams \cite{NW} and Tutte \cite{Tu} have laid the foundations of the theories of packing arborescences and packing trees. The directed version has been extensively investigated, resulting in a great number of generalizations. In contrast, the undirected version has been marginally considered. The aim of this paper is to further develop the theories of packing trees and forests. Our main result on graphs characterizes the existence of a packing of $k$ forests, $F_1, \ldots, F_k$, in a graph $G$ such that each vertex of $G$ belongs to exactly $h$ of the forests, and in addition, each $F_i$ has between $\ell(i)$ and $\ell'(i)$ connected components and the total number of connected components in the packing is between $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Finally, we extend this result to hypergraphs and dypergraphs, the latter giving a generalization of a theorem of B\'erczi and Frank \cite{BF3}.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Recipe for Combinatorial Optimization with Multi-Filter GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success for a variety of tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. However, the use of GNNs (and machine learning more generally) to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems is much less explored. Here, we introduce GCON, a novel GNN architecture that leverages a complex filter bank and localized attention mechanisms to solve CO problems on graphs. We show how our method differentiates itself from prior GNN-based CO solvers and how it can be effectively applied to the maximum cut, minimum dominating set, and maximum clique problems in a unsupervised learning setting. GCON is competitive across all tasks and consistently outperforms other specialized GNN-based approaches, and is on par with the powerful Gurobi solver on the max-cut problem. We provide an open-source implementation of our work at https://github.com/WenkelF/copt.</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm will be open-sourced at time of publication.</description>

      <title>Extending 1089 attractor to any number of digits and any number of steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known 1089 trick reflects an amazing trait of digital reversal process and reminisces of a limiting attractor in dynamical systems even though it takes only two steps. It is natural to consider the situations when the number of digits is beyond three as in the original 1089 trick, as well as situations when the number of steps is beyond two. The first part has been mostly done by Webster which we will reproduce. After two steps, the resulting integers are called Papadakis-Webster integers (PWI), which is always divisible by 99, and the resulting quotients consist of only 0's and 1's, which we name Papadakis-Webster binary strings (PWBS). Not all binary strings could be PWBS, and we define the hairpin pairing rule to determine if a binary string is a PWBS. For the second part, we propose a two-option iteration system named iterative digital reversal (IDR) suitably interweaving additions and subtractions. The simplest limiting behavior of IDR is 2-cycles. The elements in an IDR 2-cycle are all composed of repetitions of the 10(9)$_L$89 (L&gt;=0) motif, and are all PWIs. The lower 2-cycle elements after division of 99 belong to the subset of PWBS that are palindromic and consist of 0- and 1-blocks with a minimal length of two. IDR also has higher p-cycles (p=10,12,71) whose elements seem to contain at least one PWI. Another interesting finding about IDR is that it contains non-periodic and diverging trajectories, as the integer values grow to infinity. In these diverging trajectories, while the number of flanking digits around the middle point increases by the iteration, the middle part has an 8-cycle rhythm or signature which has been found in all diverging trajectories. Overall, the generalization of the original 1089 trick in both space and time leads to new patterns in integers and new phenomenology in dynamics.</description>
