      <title>A Framework for Understanding the Impact of Integrating Conceptual and Quantitative Reasoning in a Quantum Optics Tutorial on Students' Conceptual Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of incorporating quantitative reasoning for deeper sense-making in a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) on students' conceptual performance using a framework emphasizing integration of conceptual and quantitative aspects of quantum optics. In this investigation, we compared two versions of the QuILT that were developed and validated to help students learn various aspects of quantum optics using a Mach Zehnder Interferometer with single photons and polarizers. One version of the QuILT is entirely conceptual while the other version integrates quantitative and conceptual reasoning (hybrid version). Performance on conceptual questions of upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who engaged with the hybrid QuILT was compared with that of those who utilized the conceptual QuILT emphasizing the same concepts. Both versions of the QuILT focus on the same concepts, use a scaffolded approach to learning, and take advantage of research on students' difficulties in learning. The hybrid and conceptual QuILTs were used in courses for upper-level undergraduates or first-year physics graduate students in several consecutive years at the same university. The same conceptual pre-test and post-test were administered after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts and after student engaged with the QuILT, respectively. We find that the post-test performance of physics graduate students who utilized the hybrid QuILT on conceptual questions, was better than those who utilized the conceptual QuILT. For undergraduates, the results showed differences for different classes. One possible interpretation of these findings consistent with our framework is that integrating conceptual and quantitative aspects of physics in research-based tools and pedagogies should be commensurate with students' prior knowledge of physics and mathematics involved.</description>

      <title>Exploring Students' Understanding of Linear and Quadratic Relationships in a Projectile Motion Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that students often struggle to develop an understanding of linear and quadratic relationships. Covariational reasoning has been identified as a way to support this development. This study aims to investigate how covariational reasoning supports students in developing understandings of linear and quadratic relationships within a projectile motion context. A teaching experiment was conducted with two middle school students who engaged in a digital task exploring the relationship between height and time. The analysis characterizes how the students' covariational reasoning evolved as they interpreted the changing quantities in the task. The findings suggest that prompts encouraging students to compare linear and quadratic relationships can foster more sophisticated forms of covariational reasoning. The discussion highlights how specific features of the task design, including the affordances of technology, the emphasis on conceiving graphs as representations of covarying quantities, and the use of non-canonical graphing tasks, can support covariational reasoning.</description>

      <title>Building Bridges in Quantum Information Science Education: Expert Insights to Guide Framework Development for Interdisciplinary Teaching and Evolution of Common Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum information science and technology (QIST) presents unique educational challenges as it brings together students and researchers from many disciplines. This work presents findings from in-depth interviews with leading quantum researchers who are also educators, whose perspectives provide guidance for developing a framework for interdisciplinary QIST teaching and builds on our earlier paper that focused on QIST courses and curricula. We discuss their reflections on three critical aspects of QIST education: (1) the development of a common interdisciplinary language, (2) determining appropriate levels of abstraction and physical detail for students from various disciplines, and (3) why students should pursue courses, degrees, and careers in this field. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of linguistic evolutions such as "qubits" and "measurement bases", rather than a focus on measurement of physical observables and their corresponding Hermitian operators, has begun to create a unifying framework that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Nevertheless, educators face ongoing challenges in balancing the level of abstractness with physical details as well as mathematical rigor with conceptual accessibility. The experts emphasize that successful QIST education for an interdisciplinary student body not only requires a shift from traditional quantum mechanics pedagogy for physics majors, but careful consideration of students' diverse prior conceptual and mathematical foundations. They highlighted that students have the unique historical opportunity to participate in creating transformative quantum technologies while developing transferable skills for an evolving technological landscape. These findings provide valuable guidance for developing a framework for interdisciplinary QIST teaching especially useful for foundational courses.</description>

      <title>Sensemaking in sound from a free response final exam for 6th grade Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the sensemaking demonstrated in 6th grade students' written responses to a single question free response final exam for physics asking them to recount everything they learned over the course of the academic year. International exams such as the PISA and TIMSS show that students continue to have persistent difficulties with their comprehension, and appreciation, of science. Sensemaking and development of a deeper understanding of concepts is of fundamental importance when teaching science, but little progress has been made over the ensuing decades. The research questions are: What sensemaking of physics is communicated through a single question free response exam? In particular, what topics are preferred by students and how are the semiotic resources of written and visual representations utilized to express sensemaking? With specific attention given to the topic of sound we observe two levels of comprehension we define as Basic and Advanced, related to Bloom's Taxonomy, and we see evidence that previously low-performing students are capable of Advanced level sensemaking, thereby lending support to recent research calling for an increase in the level of complexity employed in primary and lower secondary science curricula. In addition to the sensemaking analysis, we discuss how these results are facilitated by the single question free response format which has been completely unexplored in the research literature and has the potential to be a valuable asset for research on or using assessment, as well as for teacher self-assessment.</description>

      <title>3D-printed microscope with illumination for undergraduate wave optics laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an educational tool, a microscope with a video camera, that can be fabricated either from a standard microscope or assembled from inexpensive, commercially available components (objectives, beam splitters, LEDs, linear stages) and 3D-printed elements. Usage of interference filters in combination with white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination enables the quantitative study of optical phenomena such as refraction, interference (e.g., Newton's rings), Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. Thus, we propose an instrument that can be used to illustrate the theoretical foundations of an undergraduate optics course and beyond.</description>
