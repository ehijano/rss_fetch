      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Control for a Networked Battery Energy Storage System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in modern power grids necessitates effective coordination strategies to ensure state-of-charge (SoC) balancing and accurate power delivery. While distributed control frameworks offer scalability and resilience, they also raise significant privacy concerns due to the need for inter-agent information exchange. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving distributed control algorithm for SoC balancing in a networked BESS. The proposed framework includes distributed power allocation law that is designed based on two privacy-preserving distributed estimators, one for the average unit state and the other for the average desired power. The average unit state estimator is designed via the state decomposition method without disclosing sensitive internal states. The proposed power allocation law based on these estimators ensures asymptotic SoC balancing and global power delivery while safeguarding agent privacy from external eavesdroppers. The effectiveness and privacy-preserving properties of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Set-membership identification of continuous-time MIMO systems via Tustin discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the identification of continuous-time systems from sampled data corrupted by unknown but bounded errors. A significant challenge in continuous-time identification is the estimation of the input and output data derivatives. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on set-membership techniques and Tustin discretization, which overcomes the derivative measurement problem and the presence of bounded errors affecting all the measured signals. First, we derive the proposed method and prove that it becomes an affordable polynomial optimization problem. Then, we present some numerical results based on simulation and experimental data to explore the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Neural Optimizers: Permutation-Equivariant Neural Approximation in Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) motivate the development of optimization approaches capable of adapting to streaming, heterogeneous, and asynchronous data from sensor networks. Many established optimization solvers, such as branch-and-bound, gradient descent, and Newton-Raphson methods, rely on iterative algorithms whose step-by-step convergence makes them too slow for real-time, multi-sensor environments. In our recent work, we introduced LOOP-PE (Learning to Optimize the Optimization Process, Permutation Equivariance version), a feed-forward neural approximation model with an integrated feasibility recovery function. LOOP-PE processes inputs from a variable number of sensors in arbitrary order, making it robust to sensor dropout, communication delays, and system scaling. Its permutation-equivariant architecture ensures that reordering the input data reorders the corresponding dispatch decisions consistently, without retraining or pre-alignment. Feasibility is enforced via a generalized gauge map, guaranteeing that outputs satisfy physical and operational constraints. We illustrate the approach in a DDDAS-inspired case study of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) managing multiple distributed generation agents (DERs) to maximize renewable utilization while respecting system limits. Results show that LOOP-PE produces near-optimal, feasible, and highly adaptable decisions under dynamic, unordered, and distributed sensing conditions, significantly outperforming iterative algorithm based solvers in both speed and flexibility. Here, we extend our earlier work by providing additional analysis and explanation of LOOP-PE design and operation, with particular emphasis on its feasibility guarantee and permutation equivariance feature.</description>

      <title>Climate-Resilient Ports and Waterborne Transport Systems: Current Status and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing challenges posed by climate change necessitate a comprehensive examination of the resilience of waterborne transport systems. This paper explores the nexus of climate resilience, and waterborne transport, addressing the challenges faced by ports and their connecting waterborne transport systems. It provides an in-depth analysis of the current status of climate-resilient infrastructure and operations while emphasizing the transformative potential of emerging technologies. Through a systematic review, the paper identifies critical gaps and opportunities. Research predominantly emphasizes port infrastructure over supply chain resilience, neglecting the interconnected vulnerabilities of maritime networks. There is limited focus on specific climate-induced disruptions, such as drought and compounded events, which complicate resilience planning. Methodologically, risk assessments and case studies dominate the field, while advanced technologies such as digital twins, artificial intelligence, and satellite monitoring remain underutilized. Geographic disparities in research output and a tendency toward short- to medium-term planning further constrain global and long-term resilience efforts. To address these gaps, the study advocates for systems-based approaches that integrate infrastructure, operations, and supply chains. It highlights collaborative frameworks and advanced tools, including digital twins, machine learning, and participatory modeling, as crucial for enabling predictive and adaptive risk management. This study stands as one of the first comprehensive reviews exclusively focused on climate resilience in ports and waterborne transport systems. It provides actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders, proposing a future research agenda to advance waterborne transport systems capable of withstanding multifaceted climate impacts.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Regions of Attraction Using Rollout-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The region of attraction is a key metric of the robustness of systems. This paper addresses the numerical solution of the generalized Zubov's equation, which produces a special Lyapunov function characterizing the robust region of attraction for perturbed systems. To handle the highly nonlinear characteristic of the generalized Zubov's equation, we propose a physics-informed neural network framework that employs a policy iteration training scheme with rollout to approximate the viscosity solution. In addition to computing the optimal disturbance during the policy improvement process, we incorporate neural network-generated value estimates as anchor points to facilitate the training procedure to prevent singularities in both low- and high-dimensional systems. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Droop-Based Single-Loop Grid-Forming Wind Turbines: High-Frequency Open-Loop Unstable Behavior and Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of inverter-interfaced generators introduces new instability phenomena into modern power systems. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of two widely used droop-based grid-forming controls, namely droop control and droop-I control, in wind turbines. Although both approaches provide steady-state reactive power-voltage droop characteristics, their impacts on high-frequency (HF) stability differ significantly. Firstly, on open-loop (OL) comparison reveals that droop-I control alters HF pole locations. The application of Routh's Stability Criterion further analytically demonstrates that such pole shifts inevitably lead to OL instability. This HF OL instability is identified as a structural phenomenon in purely inductive grids and cannot be mitigated through control parameter tuning. As a result, droop-I control significantly degrades HF stability, making conventional gain and phase margins insufficient for evaluating robustness against parameter variations. Then, the performance of established active damping (AD) is assessed for both control schemes. The finding indicates that AD designs effective for droop control may fail to suppress HF resonance under droop-I control due to the presence of unstable OL poles. Case studies performed on the IEEE 14-Bus Test System validate the analysis and emphasize the critical role of HF OL instability in determining the overall power system stability.</description>

      <title>Hybrid ML-RL Approach for Smart Grid Stability Prediction and Optimized Control Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical grids are now much more complex due to the rapid integration of distributed generation and alternative energy sources, which makes forecasting grid stability with optimized control a crucial task for operators. Traditional statistical, physics-based, and ML models can learn the pattern of the grid features, but have limitations in optimal strategy control with instability prediction. This work proposes a hybrid ML-RL framework that leverages ML for rapid stability prediction and RL for dynamic control and optimization. The first stage of this study created a baseline that explored the potential of various ML models for stability prediction. Out of them, the stacking classifiers of several fundamental models show a significant performance in classifying the instability, leading to the second stage, where reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, A2C, and DQN) optimize power control actions. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid ML-RL model effectively stabilizes the grid, achieves rapid convergence, and significantly reduces training time. The integration of ML-based stability classification with RL-based dynamic control enhances decision-making efficiency while lowering computational complexity, making it well-suited for real-time smart grid applications.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Equation Modeling of Composite Loads: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network based Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing penetration of distributed energy resources installed behind the meter, there is a growing need for adequate modelling of composite loads to enable accurate power system simulation analysis. Existing measurement based load modeling methods either fit fixed-structure physical models, which limits adaptability to evolving load mixes, or employ flexible machine learning methods which are however black boxes and offer limited interpretability. This paper presents a new learning based load modelling method based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks towards modelling flexibility and interpretability. By actively learning activation functions on edges, KANs automatically derive free form symbolic equations that capture nonlinear relationships among measured variables without prior assumptions about load structure. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other methods in both accuracy and generalization ability, while uniquely representing composite loads into transparent, interpretable mathematical equations.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Architecture and Efficient Pattern Synthesis for Polarimetric Phased Array Based on Polarization Coding Reconfigurable Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric phased arrays (PPAs) enhance radar target detection and anti-jamming capabilities. However, the dual transmit/receive (T/R) channel requirement leads to high costs and system complexity. To address this, this paper introduces a polarization-coding reconfigurable phased array (PCRPA) and associated pattern synthesis techniques to reduce PPA costs while minimizing performance degradation. Each PCRPA element connects to a single T/R channel and incorporates two-level RF switches for real-time control of polarization states and waveforms. By adjusting element codes and excitation weights, the PCRPA can generate arbitrarily polarized and dual-polarized beams. Efficient beam pattern synthesis methods are also proposed, featuring novel optimization constraints derived from theoretical and analytical analysis of PCRPAs. Simulations demonstrate that the approach achieves low cross-polarization and sidelobe levels comparable to conventional architectures within the scan range, particularly for large arrays. However, the channel reduction inevitably incurs power and directivity loss. Experiments conducted on an $8\times 8$ X-band array antenna validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The PCRPA and synthesis methods are well-suited for large-scale PPA systems, offering significant cost-effectiveness while maintaining good sidelobe suppression and polarization control performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Safety-Critical MPC for Multi-Agent Formation Control and Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nonlinear multi-agent systems with high relative degrees, achieving formation control and obstacle avoidance in a distributed manner remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed safety-critical model predictive control (DSMPC) algorithm that incorporates discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHCBFs) to enforce safety constraints, alongside discrete-time control Lyapunov functions (DCLFs) to establish terminal constraints. To facilitate distributed implementation, we develop estimated neighbor states for formulating DHCBFs and DCLFs, while also devising a bound constraint to limit estimation errors and ensure convergence. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees regarding the feasibility and stability of the proposed DSMPC algorithm based on a mild assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by the simulation results, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computation time compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Based Perturb and Observe for Fast Optimization of Unknown, Time-Varying Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free adaptive optimization methods are capable of optimizing unknown, time-varying processes even when other optimization methods are not. However, their practical application is often limited by perturbations that are used to gather information on the unknown cost and its gradient. The aim of this paper is to develop a perturb-and-observe (P&amp;O) method that reduces the need for such perturbations while still achieving fast and accurate tracking of time-varying optima. To this end, a (time-varying) model of the cost is constructed in an online fashion, taking into account the uncertainty on the measured performance cost as well as the decreasing reliability of older measurements. Perturbations are only used when this is expected to lead to improved performance over a certain time horizon. Convergence conditions are provided under which the strategy converges to a neighborhood of the optimum. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that uncertainty-based P\&amp;O can reduce the number of perturbations significantly while still tracking a time-varying optimum accurately.</description>

      <title>Limited Preemption of the 3-Phase Task Model using Preemption Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phased execution models are a well-known solution to tackle the unpredictability of today's complex COTS multi-core platforms. The semantics of these models dedicate phases for a task's execution and shared memory accesses. Memory phases are solely dedicated to load all necessary instructions and data to private local memory, and to write back the results of the computation. During execution phases, only the private local memory is accessed. While non-preemptive execution phases utilize the local memory well, schedulability is reduced due to blocking. On the other hand, fully preemptive execution phases allow for better schedulability, but require local memory to be large enough to hold all tasks involved in preemption simultaneously. Limited preemption is a promising approach that provides moderation between non-preemptive and fully preemptive scheduling.
  In this paper, we propose using preemption thresholds to limit the number of preemptions to minimize local memory usage while maintaining schedulability. We propose a worst-case response time and a worst-case memory requirement analysis for sporadic 3-phase tasks under partitioned fixed-priority scheduling with preemption thresholds. We further show how the state-of-the-art algorithm to assign preemption thresholds can be applied to the considered task model. Evaluations demonstrate that preemption thresholds can significantly reduce the memory usage (by $2.5\times$) compared to fully preemptive scheduling, while maintaining high schedulability ratios ($13\times$) compared to non-preemptive scheduling.</description>

      <title>Combined Stochastic and Robust Optimization for Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand with Nested Benders Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models (LLMs) for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to simplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis on their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case studies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA, providing valuable insights for researchers interested in leveraging advanced AI technologies for EDA.</description>

      <title>SNIC bifurcation and its Application to MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations, causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation, rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution. Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be valid in extracting the comb.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Fictitious Play for Learning in Anonymous Polymatrix Games (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fictitious play (FP) is a well-studied algorithm that enables agents to learn Nash equilibrium in games with certain reward structures. However, when agents have no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge: the joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which slows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates this issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not on who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate fictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency of the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents' individual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP converges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In essence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without losing the convergence guarantees. Using simulations, we provide empirical evidence on how this reduction accelerates convergence.</description>

      <title>Aleks: AI powered Multi Agent System for Autonomous Scientific Discovery via Data-Driven Approaches in Plant Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern plant science increasingly relies on large, heterogeneous datasets, but challenges in experimental design, data preprocessing, and reproducibility hinder research throughput. Here we introduce Aleks, an AI-powered multi-agent system that integrates domain knowledge, data analysis, and machine learning within a structured framework to autonomously conduct data-driven scientific discovery. Once provided with a research question and dataset, Aleks iteratively formulated problems, explored alternative modeling strategies, and refined solutions across multiple cycles without human intervention. In a case study on grapevine red blotch disease, Aleks progressively identified biologically meaningful features and converged on interpretable models with robust performance. Ablation studies underscored the importance of domain knowledge and memory for coherent outcomes. This exploratory work highlights the promise of agentic AI as an autonomous collaborator for accelerating scientific discovery in plant sciences.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of ODE Car-Following Models: Applications to Mixed-Autonomy Platoon Control via Coupled Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal control of a mixed-autonomy platoon driving on a single lane to smooth traffic flow. The platoon consists of autonomous vehicles, whose acceleration is controlled, and human-driven vehicles, whose behavior is described using a microscopic car-following model. We formulate the optimal control problem where the dynamics of the platoon are describing through a system of non-linear ODEs, with explicit constraints on both the state and the control variables. Theoretically, we analyze the well-posedness of the system dynamics under a reasonable set of admissible controls and establish the existence of minimizers for the optimal control problem. To solve the problem numerically, we propose a gradient descent-based algorithm that leverages the adjoint method, along with a penalty approach to handle state constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical scheme through several experiments, exploring various scenarios with different penetration rates and distributions of controlled vehicles within the platoon.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Bermuda Triangle of Contention: IOMMU Interference in Mixed Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Mixed Criticality Systems (MCSs) evolve, they increasingly integrate heterogeneous computing platforms, combining general-purpose processors with specialized accelerators such as AI engines, GPUs, and high-speed networking interfaces. This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and DMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory. Consequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such environments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating memory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation and access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related side-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in performance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same architectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs, caching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing unpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU structures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how their shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that IOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where translation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we hypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar behavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as prefetching and hierarchical TLB structures. Notably, our experiments show that IOMMU interference can delay DMA transactions by up to 1.79x for lower-size transfers on the Arm SMMUv2 implementation.</description>

      <title>Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Coherent Multiplex: Scalable Real-Time Wavelet Coherence Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coherent Multiplex is formalized and validated as a scalable, real-time system for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing coherence among multiple time series. Its architecture comprises a fast spectral similarity layer based on cosine similarity metrics of Fourier-transformed signals, and a sparse time-frequency layer for wavelet coherence. The system constructs and evolves a multilayer graph representing inter-signal relationships, enabling low-latency inference and monitoring. A simulation prototype demonstrates functionality across 8 synthetic channels with a high similarity threshold for further computation, with additional opportunities for scaling the architecture up to support thousands of input signals with constrained hardware. Applications discussed include neuroscience, finance, and biomedical signal analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schedulers are critical for optimal resource utilization in high-performance computing. Traditional methods to evaluate schedulers are limited to post-deployment analysis, or simulators, which do not model associated infrastructure. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind integration of scheduling and digital twins in HPC. This enables what-if studies to understand the impact of parameter configurations and scheduling decisions on the physical assets, even before deployment, or regarching changes not easily realizable in production. We (1) provide the first digital twin framework extended with scheduling capabilities, (2) integrate various top-tier HPC systems given their publicly available datasets, (3) implement extensions to integrate external scheduling simulators. Finally, we show how to (4) implement and evaluate incentive structures, as-well-as (5) evaluate machine learning based scheduling, in such novel digital-twin based meta-framework to prototype scheduling. Our work enables what-if scenarios of HPC systems to evaluate sustainability, and the impact on the simulated system.</description>

      <title>Secure Set-based State Estimation for Safety-Critical Applications under Adversarial Attacks on Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Set-based state estimation provides guaranteed state inclusion certificates that are crucial for the safety verification of dynamical systems. However, when system sensors are subject to cyberattacks, maintaining both safety and security guarantees becomes a fundamental challenge that existing point-based secure state estimation methods cannot adequately address due to their inherent inability to provide state inclusion certificates. This paper introduces a novel approach that simultaneously ensures safety guarantees through guaranteed state inclusion and security guarantees against sensor attacks, without imposing conservative restrictions on system operation. We propose a Secure Set-based State Estimation (S3E) algorithm that maintains the true system state within the estimated set under sensor attacks, provided the initialization set contains the initial state and the system remains observable from the uncompromised sensor subset. The algorithm gives the estimated set as a collection of constrained zonotopes (agreement sets), which can be employed as robust certificates for verifying whether the system adheres to safety constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimated set remains unaffected by attack signals of sufficiently large magnitude and also establish sufficient conditions for attack detection, identification, and filtering. This compels the attacker to only inject signals of small magnitudes to evade detection, thus preserving the accuracy of the estimated set. To address the computational complexity of the algorithm, we offer several strategies for complexity-performance trade-offs. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through several examples, including its application to a three-story building model.</description>

      <title>Bidding in Ancillary Service Markets: An Analytical Approach Using Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enable the participation of stochastic distributed energy resources in ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, mandates that flexibility providers satisfy a minimum 90% reliability requirement for reserve bids. This paper examines the bidding strategy of an electric vehicle aggregator under this regulation and develops a chance-constrained optimization model. In contrast to conventional sample-based approaches that demand large datasets to capture uncertainty, we propose an analytical reformulation that leverages extreme value theory to characterize the tail behavior of flexibility distributions. A case study with real-world charging data from 1400 residential electric vehicles in Denmark demonstrates that the analytical solution improves out-of-sample reliability, reducing bid violation rates by up to 8% relative to a sample-based benchmark. The method is also computationally more efficient, solving optimization problems up to 4.8 times faster while requiring substantially fewer samples to ensure compliance. Moreover, the proposed approach enables the construction of feasible bids with reliability levels as high as 99.95%, which would otherwise require prohibitively large scenario sets under the sample-based method. Beyond its computational and reliability advantages, the framework also provides actionable insights into how reliability thresholds influence aggregator bidding behavior and market participation. This study establishes a regulation-compliant, tractable, and risk-aware bidding methodology for stochastic flexibility aggregators, enhancing both market efficiency and power system security.</description>

      <title>Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium- and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized control architecture for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The system consists of a global controller (GC), and N local controllers (LCs). The GC operates at a slower timescale, imposing budget constraints on the actions of LCs, which function at a faster timescale. Applications can be found in energy grid planning, wildfire management, and other decentralized resource allocation problems. We propose and analyze two optimization frameworks for this setting: COpt and FOpt. In COpt, both GC and LCs together optimize infinite-horizon discounted rewards, while in FOpt the LCs optimize finite-horizon episodic rewards, and the GC optimizes infinite-horizon rewards. Although both frameworks share identical reward functions, their differing horizons can lead to different optimal policies. In particular, FOpt grants greater autonomy to LCs by allowing their policies to be determined only by local objectives, unlike COpt. To our knowledge, these frameworks have not been studied in the literature. We establish the formulations, prove the existence of optimal policies, and prove the convergence of their value iteration algorithms. We further show that COpt always achieves a higher value function than FOpt and derive explicit bounds on their difference. Finally, we establish a set of sufficient structural conditions under which the two frameworks become equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization algorithms. In this paper, we adopt the quasi-Newton method (QNM) from convex optimization to introduce a novel control algorithm coined as quasi-policy iteration (QPI). In particular, QPI is based on a novel approximation of the ``Hessian'' matrix in the policy iteration algorithm, which exploits two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs and allows for the incorporation of prior information on the transition probability kernel. While the proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as value iteration, it exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to that of QNM with a low sensitivity to the discount factor.</description>

      <title>Online-Score-Aided Federated Learning: Taming the Resource Constraints in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) is a widely popular distributed machine learning (ML) strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous configurations of the wireless devices pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called online-score-aided federated learning (OSAFL), specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since clients' local training steps differ under resource constraints, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm without incurring any communication overheads to the clients or requiring any statistical data information from them. We theoretically show how the new factors, i.e., online score and local data distribution shifts, affect the convergence bound and derive the necessary conditions for a sublinear convergence rate. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks with multiple popular ML models validate the effectiveness of the proposed OSAFL algorithm compared to modified state-of-the-art FL baselines.</description>

      <title>NAPER: Fault Protection for Real-Time Resource-Constrained Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06591</link>

Abstract: Fault tolerance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed on resource-constrained systems presents unique challenges for high-accuracy applications with strict timing requirements. Memory bit-flips can severely degrade DNN accuracy, while traditional protection approaches like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) often sacrifice accuracy to maintain reliability, creating a three-way dilemma between reliability, accuracy, and timeliness. We introduce NAPER, a novel protection approach that addresses this challenge through ensemble learning. Unlike conventional redundancy methods, NAPER employs heterogeneous model redundancy, where diverse models collectively achieve higher accuracy than any individual model. This is complemented by an efficient fault detection mechanism and a real-time scheduler that prioritizes meeting deadlines by intelligently scheduling recovery operations without interrupting inference. Our evaluations demonstrate NAPER's superiority: 40% faster inference in both normal and fault conditions, maintained accuracy 4.2% higher than TMR-based strategies, and guaranteed uninterrupted operation even during fault recovery. NAPER effectively balances the competing demands of accuracy, reliability, and timeliness in real-time DNN applications</description>

      <title>Computation- and Communication-Efficient Online FL for Resource-Constrained Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02972</link>

Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately. Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts.</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Optimization: A Comparative Study of Offline Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.</description>

      <title>Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Full Potential of RRAMs through Scalable and Distributed In-Memory Computing with Integrated Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponential growth in global computing demand is exacerbated due to the higher-energy requirements of conventional architectures, primarily due to energy-intensive data movement. In-memory computing with Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) addresses this by co-integrating memory and processing, but faces significant hurdles related to device-level non-idealities and poor scalability for large computing tasks. Here, we introduce MELISO+ (In-Memory Linear Solver), a full-stack, distributed framework for energy-efficient in-memory computing. MELISO+ proposes a novel two-tier error correction mechanism to mitigate device non-idealities and develops a distributed RRAM computing framework to enable matrix computations exceeding dimensions of $65,000\times65,000$. This approach reduces first- and second-order arithmetic errors due to device non-idealities by over $90\%$, enhances energy efficiency by three to five orders of magnitude, and decreases latency 100-fold. Hence, MELISO+ allows lower-precision RRAM devices to outperform high-precision device alternatives in accuracy, energy and latency metrics. By unifying algorithm-hardware co-design with scalable architecture, MELISO+ significantly advances sustainable, high-dimensional computing suitable for applications like large language models and generative AI.</description>
