      <title>Performances and Correlations of Centrality Measures in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous centrality measures have been proposed to evaluate the importance of nodes in networks, yet comparative analyses of these measures remain limited. Based on 80 real-world networks, we conducted an empirical analysis of 16 representative centrality measures. In general, there exists a moderate to high level of correlation between node rankings derived from different measures. We identified two distinct communities: one comprising 4 measures and the other 7 measures. Measures within the same community exhibit exceptionally strong pairwise correlations. In contrast, the remaining five measures display markedly different behaviors, showing weak correlations not only among themselves but also with the other measures. This suggests that each of these five measures likely captures unique properties of node importance. Further analysis reveals that the distribution patterns of the most influential nodes identified by different centrality measures vary significantly: some measures tend to cluster influential nodes closely together, while others disperse them across distant locations within the network. Using the epidemic spreading model, we found that LocalRank, Subgraph Centrality, and Katz Centrality perform best in identifying the most influential single node, whereas Leverage Centrality, Collective Influence, and Cycle Ratio excel in identifying the most influential node sets. Overall, measures that identify influential nodes with larger topological distances between them tend to perform better in detecting influential node sets. Interestingly, despite being applied to the same dynamical process, when using two seemingly similar tasks, identifying influential nodes versus identifying influential node sets, to rank the performances of the 16 centrality measures, the resulting rankings are negatively correlated.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Survival Prediction using Longitudinal Images based on Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis utilizing multiple longitudinal medical images plays a pivotal role in the early detection and prognosis of diseases by providing insight beyond single-image evaluations. However, current methodologies often inadequately utilize censored data, overlook correlations among longitudinal images measured over multiple time points, and lack interpretability. We introduce SurLonFormer, a novel Transformer-based neural network that integrates longitudinal medical imaging with structured data for survival prediction. Our architecture comprises three key components: a Vision Encoder for extracting spatial features, a Sequence Encoder for aggregating temporal information, and a Survival Encoder based on the Cox proportional hazards model. This framework effectively incorporates censored data, addresses scalability issues, and enhances interpretability through occlusion sensitivity analysis and dynamic survival prediction. Extensive simulations and a real-world application in Alzheimer's disease analysis demonstrate that SurLonFormer achieves superior predictive performance and successfully identifies disease-related imaging biomarkers.</description>

      <title>A Diagnostic to Find and Help Combat Stochastic Positivity Issues -- with a Focus on Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The positivity assumption is central in the identification of a causal effect, and especially the stochastic variant is an issue many applied researchers face, yet is rarely discussed, especially in conjunction with continuous treatments or Modified Treatment Policies. One common recommendation for dealing with a violation is to change the estimand. However, an applied researcher is faced with two problems: First, how can she tell whether there is a stochastic positivity violation given her estimand of interest, preferably without having to estimate a model first? Second, if she finds a problem with stochastic positivity, how should she change her estimand in order to arrive at an estimand which does not face the same issues? We suggest a novel diagnostic which allows the researcher to answer both questions by providing insights into how well an estimation for a certain estimand can be made for each observation using the data at hand. We provide a simulation study on the general behaviour of different Modified Treatment Policies (MTPs) at different levels of stochastic positivity violations and show how the diagnostic helps understand where bias is to be expected. We illustrate the application of our proposed diagnostic in a pharmacoepidemiological study based on data from CHAPAS-3, a trial comparing different treatment regimens for children living with HIV.</description>
