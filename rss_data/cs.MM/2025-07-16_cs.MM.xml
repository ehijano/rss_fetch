      <title>MultiVox: Benchmarking Voice Assistants for Multimodal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered omni models to act as voice assistants capable of understanding spoken dialogues. These models can process multimodal inputs beyond text, such as speech and visual data, enabling more context-aware interactions. However, current benchmarks fall short in comprehensively evaluating how well these models generate context-aware responses, particularly when it comes to implicitly understanding fine-grained speech characteristics, such as pitch, emotion, timbre, and volume or the environmental acoustic context such as background sounds. Additionally, they inadequately assess the ability of models to align paralinguistic cues with complementary visual signals to inform their responses. To address these gaps, we introduce MultiVox, the first omni voice assistant benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of voice assistants to integrate spoken and visual cues including paralinguistic speech features for truly multimodal understanding. Specifically, MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated and recorded speech dialogues that encompass diverse paralinguistic features and a range of visual cues such as images and videos. Our evaluation on 9 state-of-the-art models reveals that, although humans excel at these tasks, current models consistently struggle to produce contextually grounded responses.</description>

      <title>Teach Me Sign: Stepwise Prompting LLM for Sign Language Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of smart devices leads to an exponential increase in multimedia content. However, advancements in deep learning have also enabled the creation of highly sophisticated Deepfake content, including speech Deepfakes, which pose a serious threat by generating realistic voices and spreading misinformation. To combat this, numerous challenges have been organized to advance speech Deepfake detection techniques. In this survey, we systematically analyze more than 200 papers published up to March 2024. We provide a comprehensive review of each component in the detection pipeline, including model architectures, optimization techniques, generalizability, evaluation metrics, performance comparisons, available datasets, and open source availability. For each aspect, we assess recent progress and discuss ongoing challenges. In addition, we explore emerging topics such as partial Deepfake detection, cross-dataset evaluation, and defences against adversarial attacks, while suggesting promising research directions. This survey not only identifies the current state of the art to establish strong baselines for future experiments but also offers clear guidance for researchers aiming to enhance speech Deepfake detection systems.</description>
