      <title>Minimal velocity of the travelling wave solutions in two coupled FKPP equations with the global conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the system of two coupled one-dimensional Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equations which possess the global conservation law. Such system of equations has been recently derived for the quasiparticle densities in the two-band fermionic model with the particle-number conserving dissipative protocol. As standard FKPP equation the studied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous solution with travelling wave switching between them. We demonstrate that the conservation law enforces the synchronization of travelling waves for both densities and determine their minimal possible velocity. Surprisingly, we find the existence of jumps of the minimal velocity as function of control parameters. We obtain that the minimal velocity of the coupled FKPP equations may significantly exceed the minimal velocity for a single FKPP equation in a wide range of control parameters.</description>

      <title>Localized In-Plane Cavity Optomechanics in MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the realization of localized in-plane optomechanical microcavities embedded within an electrostatic MEMS architecture. The system consists of a curved, clamped-clamped microbeam, fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. A green laser emitted from a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV), is directed perpendicularly onto the device under a vacuum pressure of 7 mTorr, with the beam aligned to fill the gap between the movable microbeam and its adjacent side fixed mirror. This configuration forms localized cavity optomechanical resonators that enable the generation of optomechanical soliton frequency combs through phonon lasing without electrical excitation. The optomechanical resonators' dynamics are examined through experiments and numerical simulations. First, the experimental findings unveil that in electrostatic MEMS structures, the two reflective electrodes positioned to form a capacitive gap can inadvertently form localized cavities. These cavities significantly affect optical readouts, as the photodetected signal encodes contributions from both Doppler-shifted electromagnetic waves and light scattered from the intracavity optical field. This dual contributions can distort mechanical response interpretation unless appropriately filtered. Second, experiments show that optical pumping at various positions along the microbeam induces periodic pulse trains with distinct free spectral ranges (FSRs), each corresponding to different mechanical modes. Our results present the generation of solitary optical wavepackets using in-plane localized Fabry-P\'erot microcavities formed within a MEMS device. The results suggest a path toward chip-scale, soliton frequency combs generators featuring frequency spacing on the order of kilohertz, without relying on integrated fiber optics.</description>

      <title>Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.</description>
