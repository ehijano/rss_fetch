      <title>Chemical decoding of kinematic substructures in the Galactic halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the hierarchical assembly framework, the accretion history of the Milky Way is crucial to understand its evolution. However, in massive mergers, integrals of motion are not strictly conserved, redistributing accreted stars across dynamical spaces, such as energy-angular momentum ($E-L_z$). Additionally, the in situ disc becomes kinematically heated, acquiring halo-like orbits. Consequently, even for minor mergers, which should preserve dynamical coherence, we expect their kinematic-defined samples to be contaminated by both the massive merger(s) and the disc stars. This study aims at quantifying this contamination in known accreted halo substructures. As they are defined by kinematics, we aim at cleaning their samples analysing only chemical properties. We applied the kinematic selection criteria for the halo substructures to the Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE DR17 data. Then we adopted a Gaussian Mixture Model approach to chemically compare different substructures on a star-by-star basis, taking into account several abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn, Al, and C). We argue that the chemical properties of Sequoia point towards a shared origin with GSE. Heracles, Thamnos and the Helmi Stream all likely comprise GSE and heated disc stars in a significant amount. Besides these two populations, we identified stars with chemical and orbital properties compatible with Sagittarius in the Helmi Stream and with $\omega$ Cen in Thamnos. Finally, GSE itself is contaminated by Sagittarius. Halo stars chemically compatible with GSE are spread throughout the $E-L_z$ space and considerably contaminate every halo substructure studied in this work. None of these substructures appears to be a unique population of stars with its own origin. In addition to GSE, they all appear to be mixtures of stars chemically compatible either with the metal-poor disc, Sagittarius, $\omega$ Cen, or with a combination of them.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmological Evolution of Jetted Seyfert Galaxies for z&lt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model mechanical and thermal feedback from AGN onto the evolution of Seyfert-type galaxies, studying the morphology of central galaxies growing within dark matter (DM) halos with masses logM/Mo ~11.8 at z=0. In Paper I, we focused on the end products at z=0, here we analyze evolution for z&lt;10. Black holes (SMBHs) of ~10^6 Mo were seeded at z~9.1 and z~3.7, producing jets along their spin axes. Obtained SMBH accretion rates vary in the range ~0.3-10^(-4) of the Eddington rate. We compared the basic properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate, masses, gas and stellar fractions, bulge-to-disk mass ratios, SMBH masses, etc., over the range of redshifts. Our results indicate that jets and associated over-pressured bubbles have substantial effects on Seyfert galaxy evolution, including properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM and CGM), and even beyond. This feedback can suppress and even quench star formation, reduce stellar mass and gas fraction, modify the bulge-to-disk ratios, drive outflows from galaxies and host DM halos, and metal-enrich the CGM. The jets are largely but not exclusively contained within galaxies. However, over-pressured bubbles cross and modify the composition of the CGM and IGM, their thermodynamic and dynamic state, and generate vorticity. The CGM emerges as a complex region, where action of galactic outflows and jet-formed bubbles combines with the influx from cosmological filaments and diffuse accretion. Ultimately, the above processes affect the gas balance within the galaxy, its morphology, and gas supply to the SMBH, limiting its growth.</description>

      <title>Effect of temperature on the structure of porous dust aggregates formed by coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source of high redshift dust has long been debated. One possible source are the ejecta of pair-instability and core collapse supernovae, but it is uncertain how much newly formed dust can survive the supernova reverse shock and be injected into the interstellar medium. We anticipate the structure of the pre-shocked dust to affect how much of it survives. Yet, the structure of dust formed in supernova is not well understood. We present three-dimensional soft-sphere, dust coagulation simulations aimed at studying the impact of temperature and particle size distribution on the structure of growing dust aggregates. Due to the qualitative nature of the concept of structure, there are many ways to define and quantify it, especially for an irregular aggregate. Thus, we test four metrics commonly used in the literature in order to compare the aggregate properties as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics themselves. Our findings show that higher temperatures result in denser, more compact structures for all metrics tested. Additionally, we find that structures that coagulate from a distribution of particle sizes are denser and more compact than structures formed from identical particles under similar conditions. The latter finding, however, is true for three of the metrics except for the average number of contact points, which has proven to be the least reliable of the four considered metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Galaxy group catalogue for the D10-COSMOS field with 90% spectroscopic redshift completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys conducted over the last couple of decades have proven crucial in deepening our understanding of structure growth in the Universe and galaxy evolution. While there have been several such surveys, until now those that achieve the high completeness and precision necessary to probe the low-mass end of galaxy groups have been limited to relatively low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.3$), with surveys exploring the more distant Universe being constrained by small sample sizes and/or low redshift completeness. The recent Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) aims to explore galaxy environment over the last $\sim6$ Gyr with a completeness level comparable to the most complete local Universe surveys ($&gt;85\%$). In this work, we present the galaxy group catalogue for the D10-COSMOS field from DEVILS, which achieves a redshift completeness of $90\%$ for galaxies with $Y&lt;21.2$ mag. We showcase the science potential by exploring the impact of environment on the fraction and power of active galactic nuclei (AGN), finding that satellites in galaxy groups show no evidence of altered AGN properties, while satellites in clusters exhibit increased AGN fractions but decreased AGN luminosities.</description>

      <title>Aeos is Mixing it Up: The (In)homogeneity of Metal Mixing Following Population III Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar surface abundances are records of the state of the gas from which stars formed, and thus trace how individual elements have mixed into the surrounding medium following their ejection from stars. In this work, we test the common assumption of instantaneous and homogeneous metal mixing during the formation of the first Population II stars by characterizing the chemical homogeneity of the gas in simulated star-forming environments enriched by Population III stellar feedback. Testing the homogeneity of metal mixing in this time period is necessary for understanding the spread of abundances in the most metal-poor stars, and the (in)homogeneity of individual sites of star formation. Using Aeos, a suite of star-by-star cosmological simulations, we quantify how gas abundances change over space and time relative to Population II stellar abundances using Mahalanobis distances, a measure of covariance-normalized dissimilarity. We find that the homogeneous mixing assumption holds only within $\sim100$ pc of a star-forming region and $\sim 7$ Myr following the star formation event. Beyond this regime, deviations between stellar and gas abundances increase until they become indistinguishable from assuming a homogeneous mix of metals averaged over the initial mass function. This highlights the limited applicability of assuming instantaneous and homogeneous mixing in realistic halo environments at high redshift. We identify critical mixing scales that are necessary to explore chemical evolution in the early Universe. These scales can be applied to determine the precision needed for accurate chemical tagging of observed data and to explore parameter space with analytical models.</description>

      <title>The velocity field of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the three-dimensional velocity field of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco- Cen). Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and radial velocities, we infer the velocity field using information field theory on a 70 x 70 x 50 grid at 3 pc resolution. Our model suggests the existence of a primary stellar velocity field with a secondary field that accounts for an additional young kinematic component in Upper Scorpius and Lupus. We find clear tracers of a feedback-driven expansion of the association, while Galactic rotation appears to play a subordinate role. The results confirm the existence of cluster chains and reveal coherent large-scale expansion with characteristic speeds of 1-2 km s$^{-1}$ and local maxima of about 10 km s$^{-1}$. Power spectra indicate an excess of small-scale structure and slopes shallower than Kolmogorov, consistent with energy injection from stellar feedback. Maps of the divergence reveal net positive values, implying an approximate dispersal timescale of 10-15 Myr. A comparison with molecular gas in Lupus and Ophiuchus shows broadly consistent patterns but systematic velocity offsets of several km s$^{-1}$, suggesting partial decoupling for optically visible young stars and gas. The framework presented provides a physically motivated description of the Sco-Cen velocity field and a basis for quantifying the dynamical state and feedback history of OB associations in the local Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A statistical look on kinematic planes of satellite galaxies I: frequency and properties in TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the TNG50 simulation to explore the possible existence of satellite galaxy sets, with fixed-in-time identities, forming kinematically-persistent planes (KPPs) along cosmic time around 190 MW/M31-like galaxies. This is the first study to assess their frequency within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We identify KPPs around 46 of these host galaxies, with at least 25\% of their satellites in such configurations. Thereby, KPPs appear more frequent than previously reported, appearing in $\sim24\%$ of MW/M31-like systems, and in $\sim40\%$ of those populated with $N_{\rm sat}\geq9$. We find a dependency of the former frequency on the minimum satellite stellar mass cut, suggesting that it would increase with higher mass resolution. KPP satellite members form a distinct set compared to satellites outside KPPs, located at further distances from the center of their host and maintaining higher specific angular momentum since high redshift. KPP satellites form thin and oblate planes in positional space during long periods of cosmic time. We statistically confirm that KPPs form a kind of backbone of observationally-detected positional planes, and that, in velocity space, KPPs behave as kinematic morphological disks. We show that KPP formation, defined as the time when satellite orbital poles align around a specific, fixed direction (occurring at Universe age $\sim4$ Gyr), predates the end of halo's fast-phase of mass assembly, indicating that halo processes do not drive this clustering. Finally, our results are broadly consistent with the MW's kinematic plane at $z=0$ concerning its morphological properties and degree of satellite orbital poles clustering, mitigating the tension between the existence of these structures and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Nessie: A Rust-Powered, Fast, Flexible, and Generalized Friends-of-Friends Galaxy-Group Finder in R and Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Nessie, a galaxy group finder implemented in Rust and distributed as both a Python and R package. Nessie employs the friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm and requires only on-sky position and redshift as input, making it immediately applicable to surveys that lack a well-defined luminosity function. We implement several algorithmic optimizations including binary search and k-d tree pre-selection that significantly improve performance by reducing unnecessary galaxy pair checks. To validate the accuracy of Nessie, we tune its parameters using a suite of GALFORM mock lightcones and achieve a strong Figure of Merit. We further demonstrate its reliability by applying it to both the GAMA and SDSS surveys, where it produces group catalogues consistent with those in the literature. Additional functionality is included for comparison with simulations and mock catalogues. Benchmarking on a standard MacBook Pro (M3 chip with 11 cores) shows that version 1 of Nessie can process about 1 million galaxies in around 10 seconds, highlighting its speed and suitability for next-generation redshift surveys.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons destruction in star-forming regions across 42 nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) &gt; 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning Methods to Detect for Ultra-diffuse Galaxies in KiDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) are a subset of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs), showing mean effective surface brightness fainter than $24\ \rm mag\ \rm arcsec^{-2}$ and a diffuse morphology, with effective radii larger than 1.5 kpc. Due to their elusiveness, traditional methods are challenging to be used over large sky areas. Here we present a catalog of ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates identified in the full 1350 deg$^2$ area of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using deep learning. In particular, we use a previously developed network for the detection of low surface brightness systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[LSBGnet,][]{su2024lsbgnet} and optimised for UDG detection. We train this new UDG detection network for KiDS (UDGnet-K), with an iterative approach, starting from a small-scale training sample. After training and validation, the UGDnet-K has been able to identify $\sim3300$ UDG candidates, among which, after visual inspection, we have selected 545 high-quality ones. The catalog contains independent re-discovery of previously confirmed UDGs in local groups and clusters (e.g NGC 5846 and Fornax), and new discovered candidates in about 15 local systems, for a total of 67 {\it bona fide} associations. Besides the value of the catalog {\it per se} for future studies of UDG properties, this work shows the effectiveness of an iterative approach to training deep learning tools in presence of poor training samples, due to the paucity of confirmed UDG examples, which we expect to replicate for upcoming all-sky surveys like Rubin Observatory, Euclid and the China Space Station Telescope.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved broad line region in a quasar at z=4: Dynamical black hole mass and prominent outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first near-infrared interferometric data of a QSO at z=4. The K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all 4 UTs, detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved kinematics for both the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines in the broad line region. We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. We find that more than 80\% of the HI line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to qualitatively match both the outflowing CIV line profile and the systemic OI fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong outflows are expected around a polar conical region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submillimeter astronomy is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe by revealing cosmic phenomena hidden from optical and near-infrared observations, particularly those associated with interstellar dust, molecular gas, and star formation. The Xue-shan-mu-chang 15-meter submillimeter telescope (XSMT-15m), to be constructed at a premier high-altitude site (4813 m) in Qinghai, China, marks a major milestone for Chinese astronomy, establishing the China mainland's first independently developed, world-class submillimeter facility. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, XSMT-15m will address a diverse range of frontier scientific questions spanning extragalactic astronomy, Galactic structure, time-domain astrophysics, and astrochemistry. In synergy with current and forthcoming observatories, XSMT-15m will illuminate the formation and evolution of galaxies, unravel the physical and chemical processes shaping the interstellar medium, and explore transient phenomena in the submillimeter regime. These capabilities will advance our understanding across extragalactic astronomy, Galactic ecology, astrochemistry, and time-domain astrophysics, inaugurating a new era for submillimeter research in China and the northern hemisphere.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS): TBD. Unveiling physical processes in local active galaxies. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of JWST MIRI/MRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]</description>

      <title>A Pearl in the Shell: an ultra-compact dwarf within the tidal debris surrounding spiral galaxy NGC 7531</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar substructures within tidal debris preserve information about their progenitor galaxies' properties, offering insights into hierarchical mass assembly. We examine a compact stellar system (CSS) around the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 7531, including the shell-like tidal debris. Our goals are to determine the nature of the CSS, reconstruct the accretion history, and understand how the large, diffuse shell-like structure formed. We present photometric measurements of the shell-like debris and CSS using DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) data. We obtained Keck/LRIS spectroscopic data for the CSS to confirm its association with NGC 7531 and to derive its star formation history (SFH). Deep ($\sim$27.9 mag/arcsec$^{2}$) amateur telescope images enabled complete characterization of the tidal debris structure. We confirm the CSS is associated with NGC 7531. We rename it NGC 7531-UCD1, since its stellar mass ($3.7_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\times 10^6$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), half-light radius ($R_{h} = 0.13 \pm 0.05$ arcsec) and SFH place it as an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD). NGC 7531-UCD1 was likely a nuclear star cluster (NSC) that was tidally stripped into a UCD- this is further supported by the presence of tidal tails. We quantify the shell-like debris' mass as $M_\star\sim 3$--$11\times 10^8 M_\odot$, implying a merger mass ratio of ~300:1 to 10:1. Our amateur telescope images confirm new pieces of debris, previously unclear in the DESI LS images. N-body simulations reproduce the tidal features, requiring a near radial orbit of the progenitor with two pericentric passages. The first passage coincides with the measured star formation enhancement ~1 Gyr ago. Our findings agree with predictions about the NSC to UCD formation pathway via tidal stripping, and further confirm the presence of these objects outside of our Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra-I cluster IV. A study of the Globular Cluster population in four UDGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As old stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) are key fossil tracers of galaxy formation and interaction histories. This paper is part of the LEWIS project, an integral-field spectroscopic survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Hydra I cluster. We use MUSE spectroscopy and new VIRCAM $H$-band imaging data to study the GC populations and dark matter content in four dwarf galaxies. We retrieved line-of-sight velocities for all sources in the observed MUSE fields. Since the spectroscopic measurements are limited to relatively bright sources, we developed a multi-band photometric procedure to identify additional GC candidates too faint for spectroscopic confirmation. GC candidates were selected using a combination of photometric properties and morphometric criteria. Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to constrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies. Based on the spectroscopic classification, we confirm one GC in UDG3, two in UDG7, and four in UDG11, while UDG9 has no spectroscopically confirmed bright GCs. We identify four intra-cluster GCs in the vicinity of UDG3 and UDG11, and one ultra-compact dwarf with a radial velocity only $\Delta v = -85 \pm 10\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ relative to UDG7, suggesting it may be bound to it. Considering completeness corrections and accounting for possible contamination, from photometry we estimate that the number of GCs ranges between 0 and $\sim40$ for the investigated UDGs. Their specific frequencies suggest that three out of four UDGs are either GC-rich, similar to those in the Coma cluster, or belong to an intermediate population as seen in the Perseus cluster. Dark matter content estimates, inferred from GC counts and stellar mass, indicate that these galaxies are dark-matter dominated, with dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\mathrm{dyn}} / M_\star \sim 10-1000$.</description>

      <title>The Broadband View of the Bare Seyfert PG 1426+015: Relativistic Reflection, the Soft Excess and the Importance of Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a deep, coordinated $XMM$-$Newton$ + $NuSTAR$ observation of the type 1 Seyfert PG 1426+015, a source of particular interest as the most massive reverberation-mapped black hole to date ($\log [M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\odot}]$ = $9.01^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$). The high-resolution RGS data confirm the 'bare' nature of the source, showing no evidence for absorption beyond the Galactic column, while the broadband spectrum unambiguously reveals the presence of relativistic reflection from the innermost accretion disc (in the form of a relativistically broadened iron emission and associated Compton reflection hump) as well as confirming the presence of the strong soft excess reported previously. We explore whether relativistic reflection can successfully account for the soft excess along with the higher-energy reflection features, utilizing the two most-commonly used reflection codes (REFLIONX, XILLVER). Ultimately we find that both models are able to successfully reproduce the soft excess, though in the case of the XILLVER model this is contingent on reducing the strength of the O VIII line included in the model, as otherwise this feature prevents the model from reproducing the data. The reflection models that successfully reproduce the broadband data imply a relatively high density for the accretion disc of $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}] \sim 18$, consistent with the loose anti-correlation seen from other AGN in the $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}]$ vs $\log[m_{\rm{BH}} \dot{m}^2]$ plane, as well as a moderate-to-high black hole spin of $a^* \gtrsim 0.7$. This preliminary spin constraint is strongly dependent on the assumption that the soft excess is dominated by relativistic reflection.</description>

      <title>SOFIA Polarization Spectrum of Three Star-Forming Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dust emission polarization spectrum -- how the polarization percentage changes with wavelength -- serves as a probe of dust grain properties in star-forming regions. In this paper, we present 89 $\mu$m - 214 $\mu$m polarization spectrum measurements obtained from SOFIA/HAWC+ for three star-forming clouds -- OMC1, M17, and W3. We find that all three clouds have an overall decreasing polarization percentage with increasing wavelength (i.e., a ``falling polarization spectrum''). We use SOFIA and Herschel data to create column density and temperature maps for each cloud. We fit for the slope of the polarization spectrum at each sky position in each cloud, and using the Pearson $r$ coefficient we probe each cloud for possible correlations of slope with column density and slope with temperature. We also create plots of slope vs. column density and slope vs. temperature for each cloud. For the case of OMC1, our results are consistent with those presented by J. Michail et al., who carried out a similar analysis for that cloud. Our plots of polarization spectrum slope vs. column density reveal that for each cloud there exists a critical column density below which a falling polarization spectrum is not observed. For these more diffuse sightlines, the polarization spectrum is instead flat or slightly rising. This finding is consistent with a hypothesis presented 25 years ago in a paper led by R. Hildebrand based on Kuiper Airborne Observatory data. This hypothesis is that regions shielded from near-IR radiation are required to produce a sharply falling polarization spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dark matter annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud and its impact on the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dark matter (DM) annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the Milky Way (MW) halo, using a MW-LMC analogue from the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the gamma-ray signals from DM annihilation from the LMC rises above the MW foreground by a factor of greater than 100 for the s-wave velocity-independent annihilation model, as well as for the Sommerfeld, p-wave, and d-wave velocity-dependent models. We derive upper limits on the annihilation cross section of DM particles in the LMC using Fermi-LAT data for all velocity-dependent cross section models. Bounds for d-wave annihilation are more stringent by $\sim 4-6$ orders of magnitude relative to previous bounds from dwarf galaxies, and for p-wave emission our bounds are $\sim 2-3$ orders of magnitude more stringent. We also demonstrate that the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the MW halo is greatest for the p-wave and d-wave models towards the outer MW halo, while the impact is minimal for Sommerfeld and s-wave models. The LMC boosts the DM density and velocity distribution in the outer MW halo, both by bringing in high-speed DM particles and by accelerating the DM particles of the MW, affecting the DM annihilation signals from the MW for the p-wave and d-wave models.</description>

      <title>New theoretical predictions on Type II Cepheids: towards a self consistent Pop. II distance scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids are pulsating stars that can be used as standard candles for old stellar populations due to their characteristic Period-Luminosity and Period-Luminosity-Colour relations. They are traditionally divided in 3 sub-classes, namely BL Her, W Vir and RV Tauri. In this paper we focus on the first two sub-classes, to provide a new theoretical scenario and develop tools and relations to be adopted in distance scale and old stellar populations studies. We have built new nonlinear convective pulsation models of Type II Cepheids, computed along selected stellar evolution tracks and spanning a wide range of pulsation period and stellar parameters. Three chemical compositions have been taken into account. For each assumed Z and Y, models have been computed following stellar evolution predictions for off Zero Age Horizontal Branch evolution of stellar masses lower than typical RR Lyrae stars, crossing the classical instability strip as BL Her or W Vir pulsating stars. A new theoretical prediction for the instability strip boundaries of these classes of variable stars has been obtained together with their dependence on metal abundance. The predicted light and radial velocity curves have been computed along the evolution inside the strip, showing how the amplitude and the morphology are affected by the position relative to the edges and by the luminosity and mass values. The transformation of bolometric light curves into various photometric systems allowed us to provide new theoretical Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit relations for BL Her and W Vir. These relations are consistent with previously published RR Lyrae model results but with a smaller metallicity dependence. Moreover, the application of the inferred theoretical relations to Magellanic and Galactic Type II Cepheid data provides results in good agreement with some independent distance estimates in the literature.</description>

      <title>Nucleation regions in the Large-Scale Structure II: Morphology and dynamical state of supercluster cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburst and launch of outflow in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 using hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve star formation and feedback, avoiding reliance on simplified models. We investigate the effects of stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds, and disk mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations generate a starburst lasting $\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$, although the total stellar mass often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow develops in two stages: initially, continuous SNe form small bubbles that merge into a superbubble containing warm/hot gas and intermediate- to high-density cool filaments. After $\sim10$ Myr, the superbubble breaks out of the disk, and within $\sim15$ Myr a kpc-scale outflow forms. Cool filaments survive stellar feedback, become entrained in the wind, and stretch to hundreds of parsecs. Most cool gas in outflow originates from pre-existing cool ISM, with minor contributions from in-situ cooling. While the mass loading factor is comparable to M82, the cool gas outflow rate and velocity are lower, with velocities $\sim60\%$ below observed values; warm and hot gas are $\sim25\%$ slower. SN feedback is the primary driver, and gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow, while other factors are secondary. Stronger clustered SN feedback is likely required to better match observations.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, less than $10^{-2}$ solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.</description>

      <title>Gas meets Kozai: the influence of a gas-rich accretion disc on hierarchical triples undergoing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas is present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the stars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries present in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the SMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with the gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an inclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both eccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag forces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer orbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can transition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening. As such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK oscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by the complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due to the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction with gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and formation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The treatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper modifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.</description>

      <title>The dark matter content of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor</title>

Abstract: The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.</description>

      <title>Investigating the origin of the Milky Way streams. A revised look at their orbital pole distribution in light of precession effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into its history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that several MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of satellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given that many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In this work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole distribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For a sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d&lt;100$ kpc we find that the pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we subtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower distance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the streams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction similar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole distribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the orbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole distribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample, we infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to be affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical simulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common origin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated until the selected sample also includes material at $d \gtrsim 150$ kpc.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Sightlines: Comparison of Hydrocarbon Dust Absorption Bands toward Cygnus OB2-12 and the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.</description>

      <title>Misaligned magnetized accretion flows onto spinning black holes: Magneto-spin alignment, outflow power, and intermittent jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields regulate black hole (BH) accretion, governing both inflow and outflow dynamics. When a BH accumulates substantial vertical magnetic flux, it enters the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, where dynamically important fields power jets and trigger disk eruptions. We investigate MAD evolution when the BH spin and disk angular momentum are misaligned, a likely scenario in many BH systems. Using numerical simulations, we show that jets from rapidly spinning, prograde BHs realign the inner disk via the magneto-spin alignment mechanism for initial tilts up to $T \lesssim 60^\circ$. Larger tilts lead to intermittent jets that disrupt the disk out to $r\gtrsim100$ gravitational radii, creating hot cavities and magnetized filaments. These episodic jets form a mini$-$feedback loop and may explain quasiperiodic X-ray and radio flares observed in low-luminosity active galaxies. We also find that (i) BH spin and disk tilt influence the amount of magnetic flux accumulated at the horizon, and (ii) large-scale, thick, misaligned accretion flows do not exhibit sustained Lense$-$Thirring (LT) precession. This suggests that slowly accreting BHs ($\dot{M} \ll 10^{-3} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$) are unlikely to show lightcurve quasiperiodic oscillations from LT precession, consistent with observations. Instead, magnetic flux eruptions drive jet wobbling and lateral motion, offering an alternative explanation for phenomena such as the M87 jet's apparent precession and rapid swings in blazar jet orientation.</description>
