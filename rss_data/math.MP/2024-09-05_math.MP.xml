      <title>Limiting eigenvalue distribution of the general deformed Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $X_n=A_n+H_n$, where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix (either deterministic or random) and $H_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix independent from $A_n$ drawn from complex Ginibre ensemble. We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$. In arXiv:0807.4898 it was shown that the eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$ converges to some deterministic measure. This measure is known for the case $A_n=0$. Under some general convergence conditions on $A_n$ we prove a formula for the density of the limiting measure. We also obtain an estimation on the rate of convergence of the distribution. The approach used here is based on supersymmetric integration.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. III: Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersionless limit of the standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by Einstein phonons of frequency $\Omega&gt;0$, equipped with electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$. This allows for a detailed evaluation of the general results on $T_c$ for phonons with non-trivial dispersion relation, obtained in a previous paper, (II), by the authors. The variational principle for the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal state region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, obtained in (II), simplifies as follows: If $(\lambda,\Omega,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$, where $\varpi:=\Omega/2\pi T$, and where $\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences; $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ is the dispersionless limit $P(d\omega)\to\delta(\omega-\Omega)d\omega$ of the operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ of (II). It is shown that when $\varpi \leq \sqrt{2}$, then the map $\varpi\mapsto\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$ is invertible. For $\lambda&gt;0.77$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) = \Omega f(\lambda)$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $f(\lambda)$ that converges to $f(\lambda)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,\Omega)$, which agrees with the asymptotic behavior $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) \sim C \Omega\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $\Omega$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$, where $C_\infty := \frac{1}{2\pi}\mathfrak{k}(2)^\frac12 =0.1827262477...$ is the optimal constant, and $\mathfrak{k}(\gamma)&gt;0$ the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator for the $\gamma$ model, determined in the first paper, (I), on $T_c$ by the authors.</description>

      <title>Note on Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the intrinsic relations between Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phases. We demonstrate that the existence of Dirac strings with endpoints brings non-integrable phase factors in the parameters space. We choose one of the simplest two-mode Hamilton model to visualize Dirac string and its endpoint of a wave function, based on its eigenstates. The geometric phase variation around an arbitrary circle can be calculated explicitly according to Dirac's picture, where the well-known Berry connection and curvature can be derived directly by performing Dirac monopole theory in the parameters space. The correspondence between the endpoints of Dirac strings and the accident degenerated points of eigenvalues are clearly shown for the Hermitian systems. These results suggest that Berry phase can be seen as the non-integrable phase factor induced by Dirac strings with endpoints in the parameters space, and would motivate more studies on geometric phase by performing or extending Dirac monopole theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Data-driven 2D stationary quantum droplets and wave propagations in the amended GP equation with two potentials via deep neural networks learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic deep learning approach to solve two-dimensional (2D) stationary quantum droplets (QDs) and investigate their wave propagation in the 2D amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction and two kinds of potentials. Firstly, we use the initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for 2D stationary quantum droplets of stationary equations. Then the learned stationary QDs are used as the initial value conditions for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to explore their evolutions in the some space-time region. Especially, we consider two types of potentials, one is the 2D quadruple-well Gaussian potential and the other is the PT-symmetric HO-Gaussian potential, which lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of multi-component QDs. The used deep learning method can also be applied to study wave propagations of other nonlinear physical models.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking introduced a conceptually intriguing idea involving signature-type change, which led to the no-boundary proposal for the initial conditions of the universe. According to this proposal, the universe has no beginning because there is no singularity or boundary in spacetime; however, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this entails signature-type changing manifolds where a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region at the surface where time begins.
  We present a coherent framework for signature-type changing manifolds characterized by a degenerate yet smooth metric. We then adapt firmly established Lorentzian tools and results to the signature-type changing scenario, introducing new definitions that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally closed time-reversing loops through each point on the hypersurface. By imposing the constraint of global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we demonstrate that for every point $p\in M$, there exists a pseudo-timelike loop with point of self-intersection $p$. Or put another way, there always exists a closed pseudo-timelike path in $M$ around which the direction of time reverses, and a consistent designation of future-directed and past-directed vectors cannot be defined.</description>

      <title>Generation Model of a Spatially Limited Vortex in a Stratified Unstable Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model for the generation of axisymmetric concentrated vortices. The solution of a nonlinear equation for internal gravity waves in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The corresponding expressions describing the dependences on the radius for the radial and vertical velocity components in the inner and outer regions of the vortex include combinations of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. The proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study the structure and nonlinear dynamics of vortices in the radial and vertical regions. The vortex is limited in height. The maximum vertical velocity component is reached at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the axis, and above it, an outflow occurs. The resulting instability in the stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocity components according to the hyperbolic sine law, which turns into exponential growth. The characteristic growth time is determined by the inverse growth rate of the instability. The formation of vortices with finite velocity components, which increase with time, is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can change with height. The maximum rotation is reached at a certain height. The growth of the azimuth velocity occurs according to a super-exponential law.</description>

      <title>Necking of thin-walled cylinders via bifurcation of incompressible nonlinear elastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Necking localization under quasi-static uniaxial tension is experimentally observed in ductile thin-walled cylindrical tubes, made of soft polypropylene. Necking nucleates at multiple locations along the tube and spreads throughout, involving higher-order modes, evidencing trefoil and fourthfoiled (but rarely even fifth-foiled) shaped cross-sections. No evidence of such a complicated necking occurrence and growth was found in other ductile materials for thin-walled cylinders under quasi-static loading. With the aim of modelling this phenomenon, as well as all other possible bifurcations, a twodimensional formulation is introduced, in which only the mean surface of the tube is considered, paralleling the celebrated Fl\"ugge treatment of axially-compressed cylindrical shells. This treatment is extended to include tension and a broad class of nonlinear-hyperelastic constitutive law for the material, which is also assumed to be incompressible. The theoretical framework leads to a number of new results, not only for tensile axial force (where necking is modelled and, as a particular case, the classic Consid\`ere formula is shown to represent the limit of very thin tubes), but also for compressive force, providing closed-form formulae for wrinkling (showing that a direct application of the Fl\"ugge equation can be incorrect) and for Euler buckling. It is shown that the J2-deformation theory of plasticity (the simplest constitutive assumption to mimic through nonlinear elasticity the plastic branch of a material) captures multiple necking and occurrence of higher-order modes, so that experiments are explained. The presented results are important for several applications, ranging from aerospace and automotive engineering to the vascular mechanobiology, where a thin-walled tube (for instance an artery, or a catheter, or a stent) may become unstable not only in compression, but also in tension.</description>

      <title>Classification of exceptional Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a full classification scheme for exceptional Jacobi operators and polynomials. The classification contains six degeneracy classes according to whether $\alpha,\beta$ or $\alpha\pm\beta$ assume integer values. Exceptional Jacobi operators are in one-to-one correspondence with spectral diagrams, a combinatorial object that describes the number and asymptotic behaviour at the endpoints of $(-1,1)$ of all quasi-rational eigenfunctions of the operator. With a convenient indexing scheme for spectral diagrams, explicit Wronskian and integral construction formulas are given to build the exceptional operators and polynomials from the information encoded in the spectral diagram. In the fully degenerate class $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb N_0$ there exist exceptional Jacobi operators with an arbitrary number of continuous parameters. The classification result is achieved by a careful description of all possible rational Darboux transformations that can be performed on exceptional Jacobi operators.</description>

      <title>Cutting Mechanics of Soft Compressible Solids: Force-radius scaling versus bulk modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting mechanics in soft solids present a complex mechanical challenge due to the intricate behavior of soft ductile materials as they undergo crack nucleation and propagation. Recent research has explored the relationship between the cutting force needed to continuously cut a soft material and the radius of the wire (blade). A typical simplifying assumption is that of material incompressibility, albeit no material in nature is really incompressible. In this study, we relax this assumption and examine how material (in)compressibility influences the correlation between cutting forces and material properties like toughness and modulus. The ratio {\mu}/\k{appa}, where {\mu} and \k{appa} are the shear and bulk moduli, indicates the material's degree of compressibility, where incompressible materials have {\mu}/\k{appa}=0, and larger {\mu}/\k{appa} provide higher volumetric compressibility. Following previous observations, we obtain two cutting regimes: (i) high toughness or small wire radius, and (ii) low toughness or large wire radius. Regime (i) is dominated by frictional dissipation, while regime (ii) is dominated by adhesive debonding and/or the wear resistance of the material. These regimes are controlled by the ratio between the wire radius and the elasto-cohesive length of the material: the critical crack opening displacement at fast fracture under uniaxial tension. In the large radius, regime (ii), our theoretical findings reveal that incompressible materials require larger forces. Notably, however, the elasto-cohesive length of the material, defining the transition wire radius between regimes (i) and (ii), is larger for compressible materials, which are therefore more likely to be cut in regime (i), and thus requiring larger cutting forces.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates. Since solutions of the linearized MTM equation are related to the squared eigenfunctions of the linear Lax system, the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves can be studied by using their Lax spectrum. Standing periodic waves are classified based on eight eigenvalues which coincide with the endpoints of the spectral bands of the Lax spectrum. Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the standing periodic waves are spectrally stable if and only if the eight eigenvalues are located either on the imaginary axis or along the diagonals of the complex plane.</description>

      <title>On the long-wave approximation of solitary waves in cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address justification and solitary wave solutions of the cylindrical KdV equation which is formally derived as a long wave approximation of radially symmetric waves in a two-dimensional nonlinear dispersive system. For a regularized Boussinesq equation, we prove error estimates between true solutions of this equation and the associated cylindrical KdV approximation in the L2-based spaces. The justification result holds in the spatial dynamics formulation of the regularized Boussinesq equation. We also prove that the class of solitary wave solutions considered previously in the literature does not contain solutions in the L2-based spaces. This presents a serious obstacle in the applicability of the cylindrical KdV equation for modeling of radially symmetric solitary waves since the long wave approximation has to be performed separately in different space-time regions.</description>

      <title>Global Solution of a Functional Hamilton-Jacobi Equation associated with a Hard Sphere Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years it has been shown for hard sphere gas that, by retaining the correlation information, dynamical fluctuation and large deviation of empirical measure around Boltzmann equation could be proved, in addition to the classical kinetic limit result by Lanford. After taking low-density limit, the correlation information can be encoded into a functional Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The results above are restricted to short time. This paper establishes global-in-time construction of a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, by analyzing a system of coupled Boltzmann equations. The global solution converges to a non-trivial stationary solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the long-time limit under proper assumptions.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method is applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>A microlocal investigation of stochastic partial differential equations for spinors with an application to the Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a $d$-dimensional Riemannian, spin manifold $(M,g)$ we consider non-linear, stochastic partial differential equations for spinor fields, driven by a Dirac operator and coupled to an additive Gaussian, vector-valued white noise. We extend to the case in hand a procedure, introduced in [DDRZ20] for the scalar counterpart, which allows to compute at a perturbative level the expectation value of the solutions as well as the associated correlation functions accounting intrinsically for the underlying renormalization freedoms. This framework relies strongly on tools proper of microlocal analysis and it is inspired by the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. As a concrete example we apply it to a stochastic version of the Thirring model proving in particular that it lies in the subcritical regime if $d\leq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a certain type of identities on sums of $I$-Bessel functions on lattices, previously given by G. Chinta, J. Jorgenson, A. Karlsson and M. Neuhauser. Moreover we prove that, with continuum limit, the transformation formulas of theta functions such as the Dedekind eta function can be given by $I$-Bessel lattice sum identities with characters. We consider analogues of theta functions of lattices coming from linear codes and show that sums of $I$-Bessel functions defined by linear codes can be expressed by complete weight enumerators. We also prove that $I$-Bessel lattice sums appear as solutions of heat equations on general lattices. As a further application, we obtain an explicit solution of the heat equation on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ whose initial condition is given by a linear code.</description>

      <title>Fusion of irreducible modules in the periodic Temperley--Lieb algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new family ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ of modules over the enlarged periodic Temperley--Lieb algebra ${\sf{\cal E}PTL}_N(\beta)$. These modules are built from link states with two marked points, similarly to the modules ${\sf X}_{k,\ell,x,y,z}$ that we constructed in a previous paper. They however differ in the way that defects connect pairwise. We analyse the decomposition of ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ over the irreducible standard modules ${\sf W}_{k,x}$ for generic values of the parameters $z$ and $w$, and use it to deduce the fusion rules for the fusion $\sf W \times W$ of standard modules. These turn out to be more symmetric than those obtained previously using the modules ${\sf X}_{k,\ell,x,y,z}$.
  From the work of Graham and Lehrer, it is known that, for $\beta=-q-q^{-1}$ where $q$ is not a root of unity, there exists a set of non-generic values of the twist $y$ for which the standard module ${\sf W}_{\ell,y}$ is indecomposable yet reducible with two composition factors: a radical submodule ${\sf R}_{\ell,y}$ and a quotient module ${\sf Q}_{\ell,y}$. Here, we construct the fusion products $\sf W\times R$, $\sf W\times Q$ and $\sf Q\times Q$, and analyse their decomposition over indecomposable modules. For the fusions involving the quotient modules ${\sf Q}$, we find very simple results reminiscent of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ fusion rules.
  This construction with modules ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ is a good lattice regularization of the operator product expansion in the underlying logarithmic bulk conformal field theory. Indeed, it fits with the correspondence between standard modules and connectivity operators, and is useful for the calculation of their correlation functions. Remarkably, we show that the fusion rules $\sf W\times Q$ and $\sf Q\times Q$ are consistent with the known fusion rules of degenerate primary fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our study of noncommutative resolutions of Coulomb branches in the case of quiver gauge theories. These include the Slodowy slices in type A and symmetric powers in $\mathbb{C}^2$ as special cases. These resolutions are based on vortex line defects in quantum field theory, but have a precise mathematical description, which in the quiver case is a modification of the formalism of KLRW algebras. While best understood in a context which depends on the geometry of the affine Grassmannian and representation theory in characteristic $p$, we give a description of the Coulomb branches and their commutative and non-commutative resolutions which can be understood purely in terms of algebra.
  This allows us to construct a purely algebraic version of the knot homology theory defined using string theory by Aganagi\'c, categorifying the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants for minuscule representations of type ADE Lie algebras. We show that this homological invariant agrees with the categorification of these invariants previously defined by the author, and thus with Khovanov-Rozansky homology in type A.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the structure of the Swanson oscillator which is a well-known example of a non-Hermitian quantum system consisting of a general representation of a quadratic Hamiltonian, we propose a fermionic extension of such a scheme which incorporates two fermionic oscillators together with bilinear-coupling terms that do not conserve particle number. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and expose the appearance of exceptional points where two of the eigenstates coalesce with the corresponding eigenvectors exhibiting self-orthogonality with respect to the bi-orthogonal inner product. The model admits a quantum phase transition - we discuss the two phases and also demonstrate that the ground-state entanglement entropy exhibits a discontinuous jump indicating the transition between the two phases.</description>

Abstract: The combination of functional limit theorems with the pathwise analysis of deterministic and stochastic differential equations has proven to be a powerful approach to the analysis of fast-slow systems. In a multivariate setting, this requires rough path ideas, as already suggested in the seminal work [Melbourne-Stuart, Nonlinearity, 24, 2011]. This initiated a program pursued by numerous authors and which has required substantial results on invariance principles (also known as functional central limit theorems) in rough path topologies. We take a unified point of view and provide simple and exact formulas, of the Green-Kubo type, that characterize the relevant Brownian rough path limits and discuss how they naturally apply in different settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

      <title>Potential Hessian Ascent: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first iterative spectral algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for a random quadratic objective over the discrete hypercube, resolving a conjecture of Subag [Subag, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 74(5), 2021].
  The algorithm is a randomized Hessian ascent in the solid cube, with the objective modified by subtracting an instance-independent potential function [Chen et al., Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 76(7), 2023].
  Using tools from free probability theory, we construct an approximate projector into the top eigenspaces of the Hessian, which serves as the covariance matrix for the random increments. With high probability, the iterates' empirical distribution approximates the solution to the primal version of the Auffinger-Chen SDE [Auffinger et al., Communications in Mathematical Physics, 335, 2015]. The per-iterate change in the modified objective is bounded via a Taylor expansion, where the derivatives are controlled through Gaussian concentration bounds and smoothness properties of a semiconcave regularization of the Fenchel-Legendre dual to the Parisi PDE.
  These results lay the groundwork for (possibly) demonstrating low-degree sum-of-squares certificates over high-entropy step distributions for a relaxed version of the Parisi formula [Open Question 1.8, arXiv:2401.14383].</description>

      <title>Third-Quantized Master Equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>On certain classes of mild solutions of the scalar Li\'enard equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of some classes of mild solutions which are almost periodic (AP-), asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) and pseudo almost periodic (PAP-) of the scalar Lin\'eard equation by employing the notion of Green function and Massera-type principle. First, by changing variable we convert this equation to a system of first order differential equations. Then, we transform the problem into a framework of an abstract parabolic evolution equation which associates with an evolution family equipped an exponential dichtonomy and the corresponding Green function is exponentially almost periodic. After that, we prove a Massera-type principle that the corresponding linear equation has a uniqueness AP-, AAP- and PAP- mild solution if the right hand side and the coefficient functions are AP-, AAP- and PAP- functions, respectively. The well-posedness of semilinear equation is proved by using fixed point arguments and the exponential decay of mild solutions are obtained by using Gronwall's inequality. Although our work revisits some previous works on well-posedness of the Lin\'eard equation on these type solutions but provide a difference view by using Green function and go farther on the aspects of asymptotic behaviour of solutions and the construction of abstract theory. Our abstract results can be also applied to other parabolic evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition-based coupling of Operator Inference reduced order models via the Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an approach for coupling together subdomain-local reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) with each other and with subdomain-local full order models (FOMs), following a domain decomposition of the spatial geometry on which a given partial differential equation (PDE) is posed. Joining subdomain-local models is accomplished using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method, a minimally-intrusive multiscale coupling technique that works by transforming a monolithic problem into a sequence of subdomain-local problems, which communicate through transmission boundary conditions imposed on the subdomain interfaces. After formulating the overlapping Schwarz alternating method for OpInf ROMs, termed OpInf-Schwarz, we evaluate the method's accuracy and efficiency on several test cases involving the heat equation in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling together arbitrary combinations of OpInf ROMs and FOMs, and that speed-ups over a monolithic FOM are possible when performing OpInf ROM coupling.</description>
