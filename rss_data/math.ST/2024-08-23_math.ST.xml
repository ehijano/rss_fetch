      <title>Statistical inference on kurtosis of elliptical distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate elliptically-contoured distributions are widely used for modeling correlated and non-Gaussian data. In this work, we study the kurtosis of the elliptical model, which is an important parameter in many statistical analysis. Based on U-statistics, we develop an estimation method. Theoretically, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent under regular conditions, especially we relax a moment condition and the restriction that the data dimension and the sample size are of the same order. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic normality of the estimator and evaluate the asymptotic variance through several examples, which allows us to construct a confidence interval. The performance of our method is validated by extensive simulations and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Factor Adjusted Spectral Clustering for Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a factor modeling-based approach for clustering high-dimensional data generated from a mixture of strongly correlated variables. Statistical modeling with correlated structures pervades modern applications in economics, finance, genomics, wireless sensing, etc., with factor modeling being one of the popular techniques for explaining the common dependence. Standard techniques for clustering high-dimensional data, e.g., naive spectral clustering, often fail to yield insightful results as their performances heavily depend on the mixture components having a weakly correlated structure. To address the clustering problem in the presence of a latent factor model, we propose the Factor Adjusted Spectral Clustering (FASC) algorithm, which uses an additional data denoising step via eliminating the factor component to cope with the data dependency. We prove this method achieves an exponentially low mislabeling rate, with respect to the signal to noise ratio under a general set of assumptions. Our assumption bridges many classical factor models in the literature, such as the pervasive factor model, the weak factor model, and the sparse factor model. The FASC algorithm is also computationally efficient, requiring only near-linear sample complexity with respect to the data dimension. We also show the applicability of the FASC algorithm with real data experiments and numerical studies, and establish that FASC provides significant results in many cases where traditional spectral clustering fails.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Functional Random Forests: Novel Explainability Tools for Model Transparency in High-Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of big data has raised significant challenges in analysing high-dimensional datasets across various domains such as medicine, ecology, and economics. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has proven to be a robust framework for addressing these challenges, enabling the transformation of high-dimensional data into functional forms that capture intricate temporal and spatial patterns. However, despite advancements in functional classification methods and very high performance demonstrated by combining FDA and ensemble methods, a critical gap persists in the literature concerning the transparency and interpretability of black-box models, e.g. Functional Random Forests (FRF). In response to this need, this paper introduces a novel suite of explainability tools to illuminate the inner mechanisms of FRF. We propose using Functional Partial Dependence Plots (FPDPs), Functional Principal Component (FPC) Probability Heatmaps, various model-specific and model-agnostic FPCs' importance metrics, and the FPC Internal-External Importance and Explained Variance Bubble Plot. These tools collectively enhance the transparency of FRF models by providing a detailed analysis of how individual FPCs contribute to model predictions. By applying these methods to an ECG dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools in revealing critical patterns and improving the explainability of FRF.</description>

      <title>Distributed quasi-Newton robust estimation under differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For distributed computing with Byzantine machines under Privacy Protection (PP) constraints, this paper develops a robust PP distributed quasi-Newton estimation, which only requires the node machines to transmit five vectors to the central processor with high asymptotic relative efficiency. Compared with the gradient descent strategy which requires more rounds of transmission and the Newton iteration strategy which requires the entire Hessian matrix to be transmitted, the novel quasi-Newton iteration has advantages in reducing privacy budgeting and transmission cost. Moreover, our PP algorithm does not depend on the boundedness of gradients and second-order derivatives. When gradients and second-order derivatives follow sub-exponential distributions, we offer a mechanism that can ensure PP with a sufficiently high probability. Furthermore, this novel estimator can achieve the optimal convergence rate and the asymptotic normality. The numerical studies on synthetic and real data sets evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Latent Gaussian Graphical Models with Golazo Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of latent variables in practical problems is common, for example when some variables are difficult or expensive to measure, or simply unknown. When latent variables are unaccounted for, structure learning for Gaussian graphical models can be blurred by additional correlation between the observed variables that is incurred by the latent variables. A standard approach for this problem is a latent version of the graphical lasso that splits the inverse covariance matrix into a sparse and a low-rank part that are penalized separately. In this paper we propose a generalization of this via the flexible Golazo penalty. This allows us to introduce latent versions of for example the adaptive lasso, positive dependence constraints or predetermined sparsity patterns, and combinations of those. We develop an algorithm for the latent Gaussian graphical model with the Golazo penalty and demonstrate it on simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>A new adaptive local polynomial density estimation procedure on complicated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pointwise estimation of multivariate density functions on known domains of arbitrary dimensions using nonparametric local polynomial estimators. Our method is highly flexible, as it applies to both simple domains, such as open connected sets, and more complicated domains that are not star-shaped around the point of estimation. This enables us to handle domains with sharp concavities, holes, and local pinches, such as polynomial sectors. Additionally, we introduce a data-driven selection rule based on the general ideas of Goldenshluger and Lepski. Our results demonstrate that the local polynomial estimators are minimax under a $L^2$ risk across a wide range of H\"older-type functional classes. In the adaptive case, we provide oracle inequalities and explicitly determine the convergence rate of our statistical procedure. Simulations on polynomial sectors show that our oracle estimates outperform those of the most popular alternative method, found in the sparr package for the R software. Our statistical procedure is implemented in an online R package which is readily accessible.</description>
