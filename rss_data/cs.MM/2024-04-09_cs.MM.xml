      <title>TCAN: Text-oriented Cross Attention Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) endeavors to understand human sentiment by leveraging language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Despite the remarkable performance exhibited by previous MSA approaches, the presence of inherent multimodal heterogeneities poses a challenge, with the contribution of different modalities varying considerably. Past research predominantly focused on improving representation learning techniques and feature fusion strategies. However, many of these efforts overlooked the variation in semantic richness among different modalities, treating each modality uniformly. This approach may lead to underestimating the significance of strong modalities while overemphasizing the importance of weak ones. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a Text-oriented Cross-Attention Network (TCAN), emphasizing the predominant role of the text modality in MSA. Specifically, for each multimodal sample, by taking unaligned sequences of the three modalities as inputs, we initially allocate the extracted unimodal features into a visual-text and an acoustic-text pair. Subsequently, we implement self-attention on the text modality and apply text-queried cross-attention to the visual and acoustic modalities. To mitigate the influence of noise signals and redundant features, we incorporate a gated control mechanism into the framework. Additionally, we introduce unimodal joint learning to gain a deeper understanding of homogeneous emotional tendencies across diverse modalities through backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that TCAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MSA methods on two datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI).</description>

      <title>3DMambaIPF: A State Space Model for Iterative Point Cloud Filtering via Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is an inevitable aspect of point cloud acquisition, necessitating filtering as a fundamental task within the realm of 3D vision. Existing learning-based filtering methods have shown promising capabilities on small-scale synthetic or real-world datasets. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these methods is constrained when dealing with a substantial quantity of point clouds. This limitation primarily stems from their limited denoising capabilities for large-scale point clouds and their inclination to generate noisy outliers after denoising. The recent introduction of State Space Models (SSMs) for long sequence modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP) presents a promising solution for handling large-scale data. Encouraged by iterative point cloud filtering methods, we introduce 3DMambaIPF, firstly incorporating Mamba (Selective SSM) architecture to sequentially handle extensive point clouds from large scenes, capitalizing on its strengths in selective input processing and long sequence modeling capabilities. Additionally, we integrate a robust and fast differentiable rendering loss to constrain the noisy points around the surface. In contrast to previous methodologies, this differentiable rendering loss enhances the visual realism of denoised geometric structures and aligns point cloud boundaries more closely with those observed in real-world objects. Extensive evaluation on datasets comprising small-scale synthetic and real-world models (typically with up to 50K points) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we showcase the superior scalability and efficiency of our method on large-scale models with about 500K points, where the majority of the existing learning-based denoising methods are unable to handle.</description>

      <title>D2SL: Decouple Defogging and Semantic Learning for Foggy Domain-Adaptive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated domain adaptive semantic segmentation in foggy weather scenarios, which aims to enhance the utilization of unlabeled foggy data and improve the model's adaptability to foggy conditions. Current methods rely on clear images as references, jointly learning defogging and segmentation for foggy images. Despite making some progress, there are still two main drawbacks: (1) the coupling of segmentation and defogging feature representations, resulting in a decrease in semantic representation capability, and (2) the failure to leverage real fog priors in unlabeled foggy data, leading to insufficient model generalization ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel training framework, Decouple Defogging and Semantic learning, called D2SL, aiming to alleviate the adverse impact of defogging tasks on the final segmentation task. In this framework, we introduce a domain-consistent transfer strategy to establish a connection between defogging and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, we design a real fog transfer strategy to improve defogging effects by fully leveraging the fog priors from real foggy images. Our approach enhances the semantic representations required for segmentation during the defogging learning process and maximizes the representation capability of fog invariance by effectively utilizing real fog data. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Animals and Where to Find Them: Segment Any Marine Animal with Dual SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an important pillar of underwater intelligence, Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS) involves segmenting animals within marine environments. Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between discrete pixels. Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately, trained with natural images, SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition, the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues, we propose a novel feature learning framework, named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end, we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then, we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information, and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently, we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. Finally, instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals, we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (C$^3$P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between discrete pixels. With dual decoders, it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for complementary feature representations, resulting in considerable improvements over previous techniques. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on five widely-used MAS datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Drchip61/Dual_SAM.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Power of Single-Pass Look-Ahead in Modern Codecs for Optimized Transcoding Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern video encoders have evolved into sophisticated pieces of software in which various coding tools interact with each other. In the past, singlepass encoding was not considered for Video-On-Demand (VOD) use cases. In this work, we evaluate production-ready encoders for H.264 (x264), H.265 (HEVC), AV1 (SVT-AV1) along with direct comparisons to the latest AV1 encoder inside NVIDIA GPUs (40 series), and AWS Mediaconvert's AV1 implementation. Our experimental results demonstrate single pass encoding inside modern encoder implementations can give us very good quality at a reasonable compute cost. The results are presented as three different scenarios targeting High, Medium, and Low complexity accounting quality/bitrate/compute load. Finally, a set of recommendations is presented for end-users to help decide which encoder/preset combination might be more suited to their use case.</description>

      <title>Shorts on the Rise: Assessing the Effects of YouTube Shorts on Long-Form Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short form content has permeated into the video creator space over the past few years, led by industry leading products such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. YouTube in particular was previously synonymous with being the main hub for long form video content consumption. The monetization of long form videos was easier as it allowed multiple advertisement placements during the course of the video. This model also facilitated thematic brand partnerships. However, since the introduction of short form content, creators have found it more difficult to generate revenue as advertisement placements have decreased. This leads to a unique situation where people are spending more time watching shorter videos, and yet they generate less revenue for the creators. In this paper, we perform a study of 250 creators with significant audiences to see if the introduction of short form content has affected the view counts and engagement of long form content. Our findings reveal a noteworthy trend: since the advent of short-form content, there has been a significant decrease in both view counts and engagement in long-form videos on these channels.</description>

      <title>360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human perception of the world is shaped by a multitude of viewpoints and modalities. While many existing datasets focus on scene understanding from a certain perspective (e.g. egocentric or third-person views), our dataset offers a panoptic perspective (i.e. multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities). Specifically, we encapsulate third-person panoramic and front views, as well as egocentric monocular/binocular views with rich modalities including video, multi-channel audio, directional binaural delay, location data and textual scene descriptions within each scene captured, presenting comprehensive observation of the world. Figure 1 offers a glimpse of all 28 scene categories of our 360+x dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first database that covers multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities to mimic how daily information is accessed in the real world. Through our benchmark analysis, we presented 5 different scene understanding tasks on the proposed 360+x dataset to evaluate the impact and benefit of each data modality and perspective in panoptic scene understanding. We hope this unique dataset could broaden the scope of comprehensive scene understanding and encourage the community to approach these problems from more diverse perspectives.</description>
