      <title>Two-dimensional flat-band solitons in superhoneycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band periodic materials are characterized by a linear spectrum containing at least one band where the propagation constant remains nearly constant irrespective of the Bloch momentum across the Brillouin zone. These materials provide a unique platform for investigating phenomena related to light localization. Meantime, the interaction between flat-band physics and nonlinearity in continuous systems remains largely unexplored, particularly in continuous systems where the band flatness deviates slightly from zero, in contrast to simplified discrete systems with exactly flat bands. Here, we use a continuous superhoneycomb lattice featuring a flat band in its spectrum to theoretically and numerically introduce a range of stable flatband solitons. These solutions encompass fundamental, dipole, multi-peak, and even vortex solitons. Numerical analysis demonstrates that these solitons are stable in a broad range of powers. They do not bifurcate from the flat band and can be analyzed using Wannier function expansion leading to their designation as Wannier solitons. These solitons showcase novel possibilities for light localization and transmission within nonlinear flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Scattering between orthogonally wobbling kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resonant energy transfer mechanism, responsible for the presence of fractal patterns in the velocity diagrams of kink-antikink scattering, is analyzed for a family of two-component scalar field theory models, in which the kink solutions have two shape modes (one longitudinal and one orthogonal to the kink orbit), in addition to the zero mode, and in which energy redistribution can occur among these three discrete modes. We investigate the scattering between wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited, examining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the initial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with respect to the $\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay between multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering insights distinct from those observed in simpler models.</description>
