      <title>Machine learning of phases and structures for model systems in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of phase transitions is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, traditionally addressed through analytical methods and direct numerical simulations. In recent years, machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools to complement these standard approaches, offering valuable insights into phase and structure determination. Additionally, they have been shown to enhance the application of traditional methods. In this work, we review recent advancements in this area, with a focus on our contributions to phase and structure determination using supervised and unsupervised learning methods in several systems: (a) 2D site percolation, (b) the 3D Anderson model of localization, (c) the 2D $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model, and (d) the prediction of large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction patterns.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of Darcy's law of yield stress fluids on a deep tree-like network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the flow dynamics of yield stress fluids in porous media presents a substantial challenge. Both experiments and extensive numerical simulations frequently show a non-linear relationship between the flow rate and the pressure gradient, deviating from the traditional Darcy law. In this article, we consider a tree-like porous structure and utilize an exact mapping with the directed polymer (DP) with disordered bond energies on the Cayley tree. Specifically, we adapt an algorithm recently introduced by Brunet et al. [Europhys. Lett. 131, 40002 (2020)] to simulate exactly the tip region of branching random walks with the help of a spinal decomposition, to accurately compute the flow on extensive trees with several thousand generations. Our results confirm the asymptotic predictions proposed by Schimmenti et al. [Phys. Rev. E 108, L023102 (2023)], tested therein only for moderate trees of about 20 generations.</description>

      <title>Exact anomalous mobility edges in one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in understanding localization transitions and mobility edges (MEs) that separate extended and localized states in non-Hermitian (NH) quasicrystals. Here we focus on studying critical states and anomalous MEs, which identify the boundaries between critical and localized states within two distinct NH quasiperiodic models. Specifically, the first model is a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice with both nonreciprocal hopping term and on-site potential. In contrast, the second model features an unbounded quasiperiodic on-site potential and nonreciprocal hopping. Using Avila's global theory, we analytically derive the Lyapunov exponent and exact anomalous MEs. To confirm the emergence of the robust critical states in both models, we conduct a numerical multifractal analysis of the wave functions and spectrum analysis of level spacing. Furthermore, we investigate the transition between real and complex spectra and the topological origins of the anomalous MEs. Our results may shed light on exploring the critical states and anomalous MEs in NH quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Loop corrections for hard spheres in Hamming space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin with an exact expression for the entropy of a system of hard spheres within the Hamming space. This entropy relies on probability marginals, which are determined by an extended set of Belief Propagation (BP) equations. The BP probability marginals are functions of auxiliary variables which are introduced to model the effects of loopy interactions on a tree-structured interaction graph. We explore various reasonable and approximate probability distributions, ensuring they align with the exact solutions of the BP equations. Our approach is based on an ansatz of (in)homogeneous cavity marginals respecting the permutation symmetry of the problem. Through thorough analysis, we aim to minimize errors in the BP equations. Our findings support the conjecture that the maximum packing density asymptotically conforms to the lower bound proposed by Gilbert and Varshamov, further validated by the solution of the loopy BP equations.</description>

      <title>Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</description>

      <title>Generative artificial intelligence for computational chemistry: a roadmap to predicting emergent phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced exciting possibilities for computational chemistry. Generative AI methods have made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>How noise affects memory in linear recurrent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of noise on memory in a linear recurrent network are theoretically investigated. Memory is characterized by its ability to store previous inputs in its instantaneous state of network, which receives a correlated or uncorrelated noise. Two major properties are revealed: First, the memory reduced by noise is uniquely determined by the noise's power spectral density (PSD). Second, the memory will not decrease regardless of noise intensity if the PSD is in a certain class of distribution (including power law). The results are verified using the human brain signals, showing good agreement.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Enumeration of Flat-Foldings : Study on Random Single Vertex Origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with themes such as approximate counting/evaluation of the total number of flat-foldings for random origami diagrams, evaluation of the values averaged over various instances, obtaining forcing sets for general origami diagrams, and evaluation of average computational complexity. An approach to the above problems using a physical model and an efficient size reduction method for them is proposed. Using a statistical mechanics model and a numerical method of approximate enumeration based on it, we give the result of approximate enumeration of the total number of flat-foldings of single-vertex origami diagram with random width of angles gathering around the central vertex, and obtain its size dependence for an asymptotic prediction towards the limit of infinite size. In addition, an outlook with respect to the chained determination of local stacking orders of facets caused by the constraint that prohibits the penetration of them is also provided from the viewpoint of organizing the terms included in the physical model. A method to efficiently solve the problem of the determination or enumeration of flat-foldings is discussed based on the above perspectives. This is thought to be closely related to forcing sets.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Noise Rates and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</description>

      <title>Bias correction of posterior means using MCMC outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose algorithms for addressing the bias of the posterior mean when used as an estimator of parameters. These algorithms build upon the recently proposed Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife approximation (Giordano and Broderick (2023)) and can be implemented using the posterior covariance and third-order combined cumulants easily calculated from MCMC outputs. Two algorithms are introduced: The first algorithm utilises the output of a single-run MCMC with the original likelihood and prior to estimate the bias. A notable feature of the algorithm is that its ability to estimate definitional bias (Efron (2015)), which is crucial for Bayesian estimators. The second algorithm is designed for high-dimensional and sparse data settings, where ``quasi-prior'' for bias correction is introduced. The quasi-prior is iteratively refined using the output of the first algorithm as a measure of the residual bias at each step. These algorithms have been successfully implemented and tested for parameter estimation in the Weibull distribution and logistic regression in moderately high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and localization in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity has emerged as a central concept in diverse areas of physics, ranging from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. We perform a systematic study of complexity in random quantum circuits with and without measurements. We observe that complexity grows linearly before saturating to a constant value. For $N$ qubits without measurements, the saturation value scales as $2^{N-1}$, and the saturation time scales as $2^N$. This behaviour remains identical in the presence of random measurements with different probabilities, indicating that this notion of complexity is insensitive to the rate of measurement. We also study the behaviour of complexity in two variants of the random unitary floquet circuit, where we observe that complexity acts as a novel probe of Anderson localization and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir computing on random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems to various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.</description>

      <title>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and periodic two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin, $S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.</description>
