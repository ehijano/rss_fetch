      <title>On the time integration for phase field modeling of grain growth in additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase field simulations play a key role in the understanding of microstructure evolution in additive manufacturing. However, they have been found extremely computationally expensive. One of the reasons is the small time step requirement to resolve the complex microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification process. This paper investigates the possibility of using a class of stabilized time integration algorithms to accelerate such phase field simulations by increasing the time steps. The specific time integration formulation and theoretical analysis on energy stability were developed, based on a phase field model dedicated to simulating rapid solidification in additive manufacturing. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can ensure the numerical stability and a decreasing energy requirement for the phase field simulations with at least two orders-of-magnitude larger time steps over conventional explicit methods. 2D and 3D phase field simulations have been conducted with relevant physical and kinetic parameters for 316L stainless steels. This work provides a numerical framework for efficient phase field simulations and open numerous opportunities for large scale phase field modeling.</description>

      <title>Localized FNO for Spatiotemporal Hemodynamic Upsampling in Aneurysm MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Improving structure search with hyperspatial optimization and TETRIS seeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced structure prediction methods developed over the past decades include an unorthodox strategy of allowing atoms to displace into extra dimensions. A recently implemented global optimization of structures from hyperspace (GOSH) has shown promise in accelerating the identification of global minima on potential energy surfaces defined by simple interatomic models. In this study, we extend the GOSH formalism to more accurate Behler-Parrinello neural network (NN) potentials, make it compatible with efficient local minimization algorithms, and test its performance on nanoparticles and crystalline solids. For clusters modeled with NN potentials, four-dimensional optimization offers fairly modest improvement in navigating geometric relaxation pathways and incurs increased computational cost largely offsetting the benefit, but it provides a significant advantage in facilitating atom swaps in nanoalloys. In comparison, the introduction of a moderate, controlled bias for generating more physically sensible starting configurations, achieved via TETRIS-inspired packing of atomic blocks, has a more direct impact on the efficiency of global structure searches. The benchmarked systems are Lennard-Jones clusters, Au or Cu-Pd-Ag nanoparticles and binary Sn alloys described by NN potentials, and compounds with covalent B or BC frameworks modeled with density functional theory</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.</description>

      <title>phaser: A unified and extensible framework for fast electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present \code{phaser}, an open-source Python package that provides a unified interface to both conventional and gradient descent-based ptychographic algorithms. Features such as mixed-state probe, probe position correction, and multislice ptychography make experimental reconstructions practical and robust. Reconstructions are specified in a declarative format and can be run from a command line, Jupyter notebook, or web interface. Multiple computational backends are supported to provide maximum flexibility. With the JAX computational backend, a six-fold improvement in iteration speed is achieved over a widely used package implemented in MATLAB, fold\_slice/PtychoShelves. We report reconstruction success for a variety of experimental datasets, and detail the effects of regularization on convergence and reconstruction quality. The software promises to speed the application and development of ptychographic methods for materials science.</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Technology Stack for Solving Many-Electron Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) for interacting many-electron systems is fundamental to condensed matter physics, yet achieving accurate solutions confronts computational challenges in managing the combinatorial complexity of Feynman diagrams, implementing systematic renormalization, and evaluating high-dimensional integrals. We present a unifying framework that integrates QFT computational workflows with an AI-powered technology stack. A cornerstone of this framework is representing Feynman diagrams as computational graphs, which structures the inherent mathematical complexity and facilitates the application of optimized algorithms developed for machine learning and high-performance computing. Consequently, automatic differentiation, native to these graph representations, delivers efficient, fully automated, high-order field-theoretic renormalization procedures. This graph-centric approach also enables sophisticated numerical integration; our neural-network-enhanced Monte Carlo method, accelerated via massively parallel GPU implementation, efficiently evaluates challenging high-dimensional diagrammatic integrals. Applying this framework to the uniform electron gas, we determine the quasiparticle effective mass to a precision significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art simulations. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating AI-driven computational advances with QFT, opening systematic pathways for solving complex quantum many-body problems across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spherical Harmonic Gaussian type orbitals and Slater functions can be expressed using spherical coordinates or a linear combinations of the appropriate Cartesian functions. General expressions for the transformation coefficients between the two representations are provided. Values for the transformation coefficients are tabulated up to the quantum number $\ell = 10$.

      <title>GATE 10 Monte Carlo particle transport simulation -- Part II: architecture and innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past years, we have developed GATE version 10, a major re-implementation of the long-standing Geant4-based Monte Carlo application for particle and radiation transport simulation in medical physics. This release introduces many new features and significant improvements, most notably a Python-based user interface replacing the legacy static input files. The new functionality of GATE version 10 is described in the part 1 companion paper. The development brought significant challenges. In this paper, we present the solutions that we have developed to overcome these challenges. In particular, we present a modular design that robustly manages the core components of a simulation: particle sources, geometry, physics processes, and data acquisition. The architecture consists of parts written in C++ and Python, which needed to be coupled. We explain how this framework allows for the precise, time-aware generation of primary particles, a critical requirement for accurately modeling positron emission tomography (PET), radionuclide therapies, and prompt-gamma timing systems. We present how GATE 10 handles complex Geant4 physics settings while exposing a simple interface to the user. Furthermore, we describe the technical solutions that facilitate the seamless integration of advanced physics models and variance reduction techniques. The architecture supports sophisticated scoring of physical quantities (such as Linear Energy Transfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness) and is designed for multithreaded execution. The new user interface allows researchers to script complex simulation workflows and directly couple external tools, such as artificial intelligence models for source generation or detector response. By detailing these architectural innovations, we demonstrate how GATE 10 provides a more powerful and flexible tool for research and innovation in medical physics.</description>
