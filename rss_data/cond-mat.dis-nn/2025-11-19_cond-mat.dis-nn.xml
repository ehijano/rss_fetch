      <title>Topological transition induced by selective random defects on a honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the spectral and topological properties of electron systems evolve on a lattice that interpolates between the honeycomb and its 1/6-depleted structures through the introduction of selective random defects. We find that in certain parameter regimes, the topological properties of the two lattice systems are smoothly connected, whereas in other regimes, selective random defects induce a topological transition. Analysis based on an effective model reveals that the effect of selective random defects can be understood as a modulation of hopping amplitudes. Our results highlight the potential for designing and controlling the spectral and even topological properties of electronic systems across a wide range of material platforms.</description>

      <title>Strongly Electric Field Dependent Conductivity in Quantum Dot Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transport in QD solids is typically understood as thermally activated tunneling or hopping between states that are localized on individual QDs. Here, we show that the slow relaxation that is associated with the disorder-broadened density of (localized) states leads to a strong electric field F dependence of the charge carrier mobility. We interpret the results in terms of an increased effective electronic temperature T_eff that exceeds that of the lattice. We use a heat balance model to derive an analytical expression for T_eff (F) that is similar to, and puts a physical basis under the phenomenological expression proposed by Marianer and Shklovskii [Phys. Rev. B 46, 13100 (1992)]. We apply this model to analyze the field- and temperature-dependent conductivity in ZnO QDs with varying ligand length and depletion shell thickness and find (effective) localization lengths ranging from 2 to 5 nm. Both experimental and analytical results compare favorably to numerical simulations by kinetic Monte Carlo. Due to the large value of the effective localization length, the field dependence already becomes relevant at modest fields around 1-10 V/micron, that are typical for operational conditions of photovoltaic and light emitting devices based on quantum dot solids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metamorphosis: Programmable Emergence and the Breakdown of Bulk-Edge Dichotomy in Multiscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $\alpha$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $\alpha$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fields in fluctuating environment: a model for isochoric heat capacity of simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momenta space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and eigenvalue dynamics of stochastic gradient descent in multilayer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.</description>

      <title>Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Characterization of Sloppiness in Neural Networks: Insights from Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in self-attention layers, that are key components of modern architectures.</description>

      <title>Directed evolution effectively selects for DNA based physical reservoir computing networks capable of multiple tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside the field of computation, directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal bead networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate that DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <title>A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>
