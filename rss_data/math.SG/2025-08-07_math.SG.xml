      <title>Comparing cluster algebras on braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braid varieties parametrize linear configurations of flags with transversality conditions dictated by positive braids. They include and generalize reduced double Bruhat cells, positroid varieties, open Bott-Samelson varieties, and Richardson varieties, among others. Recently, two cluster algebra structures were independently constructed in the coordinate rings of braid varieties: one using weaves and the other using Deodhar geometry. The main result of the article is that these two cluster algebras coincide. More generally, our comparative study matches the different concepts and results from each approach to the other, both on the combinatorial and algebraic geometric aspects.</description>

      <title>A note on real Heegaard Floer homology and localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a localization spectral sequence for the hat variant of Guth and Manolescu's recent construction of real Heegaard Floer homology, and apply it to branched double covers and strongly invertible knots. Our construction applies to real Lagrangian Floer homology in exact symplectic manifolds equipped with anti-symplectic involutions more generally, and may be of independent interest to symplectic geometers.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebras and monotone Lagrangian tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the construction of Newton--Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations via cluster algebras in [GHKK18, FO25], we consider a family of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of a complex smooth Fano variety $X$ related by a composition of tropicalized cluster mutations. According to the work of [HK15], the toric degeneration associated with each Newton--Okounkov polytope $\Delta$ in the family produces a completely integrable system of $X$ over $\Delta$. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry for Quiver Algebroid Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03028v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new construction of quiver algebroid stacks and the associated mirror functors for symplectic manifolds. First, we formulate the concept of a quiver stack, which is a geometric structure formed by gluing multiple quiver algebras together. Next, we develop a representation theory of $A_\infty$ categories by quiver stacks. The main idea is to extend the $A_\infty$ category over a quiver stack of a collection of nc-deformed objects. The extension involves non-trivial gerbe terms. It gives an application of symplectic geometry that bridges the study of sheaves and representation theory through mirror symmetry.
  We provide a general framework for constructing mirror quiver stacks. In particular, we develop a novel method of gluing Lagrangians which are disjoint from each other by using quasi-isomorphisms with a `global middle agent', which is a Lagrangian immersion that produces a mirror quiver. The method relies fundamentally on the use of quiver stacks. We carry out this construction for compact immersed Lagrangians in a punctured elliptic curve, which results in a mirror nc local projective plane.</description>

      <title>Symplectically self-polar polytopes of minimal capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of symplectically self-polar convex bodies started in arXiv:2211.14630. We construct symplectically self-polar convex bodies of the minimal Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity. This in turn proves that the lower bound for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity for centrally symmetric convex bodies obtained in arXiv:1801.00242 cannot be improved. We also make some numerical experiments and speculations regarding the minimal volume of symplectically self-polar convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Geometric models of simple Lie algebras via singularity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type. This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</description>
