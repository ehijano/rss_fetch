      <title>Transferable Learning of Reaction Pathways from Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying minimum-energy paths (MEPs) is crucial for understanding chemical reaction mechanisms but remains computationally demanding. We introduce MEPIN, a scalable machine-learning method for efficiently predicting MEPs from reactant and product configurations, without relying on transition-state geometries or pre-optimized reaction paths during training. The task is defined as predicting deviations from geometric interpolations along reaction coordinates. We address this task with a continuous reaction path model based on a symmetry-broken equivariant neural network that generates a flexible number of intermediate structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective, with efficiency enhanced by incorporating geometric priors from geodesic interpolation as initial interpolations or pre-training objectives. Our approach generalizes across diverse chemical reactions and achieves accurate alignment with reference intrinsic reaction coordinates, as demonstrated on various small molecule reactions and [3+2] cycloadditions. Our method enables the exploration of large chemical reaction spaces with efficient, data-driven predictions of reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Prediction of CO2 reduction reaction intermediates and products on transition metal-doped r-GeSe monolayers:A combined DFT and machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a complex multi-proton-electron transfer process that generates a vast network of reaction intermediates. Accurate prediction of free energy changes (G) of these intermediates and products is essential for evaluating catalytic performance. We combined density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to screen 25 single-atom catalysts (SACs) on defective r-GeSe monolayers for CO2 reduction to methanol, methane, and formic acid. Among nine ML models evaluated with 14 intrinsic and DFT-based features, the XGBoost performed best (R2 = 0.92 and MAE = 0.24 eV), aligning closely with DFT calculations and identifying Ni, Ru, and Rh@GeSe as prospective catalysts. Feature importance analysis in free energy and product predictions highlighted the significance of CO2 activation with O-C-O and IPC-O1 as the key attributes. Furthermore, by incorporating non-DFT-based features, rapid predictions became possible, and the XGBoost model retained its predictive performance with R2 = 0.89 and MAE = 0.29 eV. This accuracy was further validated using Ir@GeSe. Our work highlights effective SACs for CO2RR, and provides valuable insights for efficient catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network Potential with explicit dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of incorporating explicit dispersion interactions in the functional form of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential for accurate modeling of liquid carbon tetrachloride, methane, and toluene. We show that explicit incorporation of dispersion interactions via D2 and D3 corrections significantly improves the accuracy of MLIPs when the cutoff radius is set to a commonly used value of 5 -- 6 \r{A}. We also show that for carbon tetrachloride and methane, a substantial improvement in accuracy can be achieved by extending the cutoff radius to 7.5 \r{A}. However, for accurate modeling of toluene, explicit incorporation of dispersion remains important. Furthermore, we find that MLIPs incorporating dispersion interactions via D2 reach a close level of accuracy to those incorporating D3, and D2 is suitable for accurate modeling of the systems in the study, while being less computationally expensive. We evaluated the accuracy of MLIPs in dimer binding curves compared to ab initio data and in predicting density and radial distribution functions compared to experiments.</description>

      <title>Real-fluid behavior in rapid compression machines: Does it matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid compression machines (RCMs) have been extensively used to quantify fuel autoignition chemistry and validate chemical kinetic models. Historically, the analyses of experimental and modeling RCM autoignition data have been conducted based on the adiabatic core hypothesis where real-fluid behavior has been completely overlooked, though this might be significant at common RCM test conditions. This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two significant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental combustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation and analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models? To this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and derived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an effective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for RCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM tests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM autoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression temperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber. Furthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can be introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming ideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical kinetic models. Therefore, we recommend the community adopt frameworks with real-fluid behavior fully accounted for to analyze and simulate past and future RCM experiments, so as to avoid misinterpretation of RCM autoignition experiments and eliminate the errors that can be introduced into the simulation results with the existing RCM modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-dependent Isotope Effect Supports Radical Pair Mechanism in Tubulin Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak magnetic fields and isotopes have been shown to influence biological processes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly because the corresponding interaction energies are far below thermal energies, making classical explanations challenging or impossible. Microtubules, dynamic cytoskeletal fibers, offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect, which can be explained via a radical pair mechanism, explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties rather than isotopic mass differences. This nuclear spin-driven isotope effect is notably enhanced under an applied weak magnetic field of approximately 3 mT. Our theoretical model based on radical pairs achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results establish a direct connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing new insights into how weak magnetic fields influence cellular and biomolecular functions.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive angulons in superfluid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the in- and out-of-equilibrium phenomena of a rotational impurity -- specifically, a linear molecule -- coupled to a nonconventional environment, a helium nanodroplet. By employing a Lee-Low-Pines-like transformation combined with a multireference configuration approach, we self-consistently account for the molecule's backaction on the superfluid bath and accurately capture the complex entanglement between the molecule's rotational degrees of freedom and the bath excitations. Our findings reveal that, in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the superfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a) attractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density defect region; and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute environments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive to attractive angulon states as the bath density increases. This work paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium phenomena of quantum impurities in interacting environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Discrete Variable Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for implementing the Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) transformation, a technique widely used in simulations of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians. DVR provides a diagonal representation of local operators and enables sparse Hamiltonian structures, making it a powerful alternative to the finite basis representation (FBR), particularly in high-dimensional problems. While DVR has been extensively used in classical simulations, its quantum implementation, particularly using Gaussian quadrature grids, remains underexplored. We develop a quantum circuit that efficiently transforms FBR into DVR by following a recursive construction based on quantum arithmetic operations, and we compare this approach with methods that directly load DVR matrix elements using quantum read-only memory (QROM). We analyze the quantum resources, including T-gate and qubit counts, required for implementing the DVR unitary and discuss preferable choices of QROM-based and recursive-based methods for a given matrix size and precision. This study lays the groundwork for utilizing DVR Hamiltonians in quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation with block encoding.</description>

      <title>High-performance training and inference for deep equivariant interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials, particularly those based on deep equivariant neural networks, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy and computational efficiency in atomistic modeling tasks like molecular dynamics and high-throughput screening. The size of datasets and demands of downstream workflows are growing rapidly, making robust and scalable software essential. This work presents a major overhaul of the NequIP framework focusing on multi-node parallelism, computational performance, and extensibility. The redesigned framework supports distributed training on large datasets and removes barriers preventing full utilization of the PyTorch 2.0 compiler at train time. We demonstrate this acceleration in a case study by training Allegro models on the SPICE 2 dataset of organic molecular systems. For inference, we introduce the first end-to-end infrastructure that uses the PyTorch Ahead-of-Time Inductor compiler for machine learning interatomic potentials. Additionally, we implement a custom kernel for the Allegro model's most expensive operation, the tensor product. Together, these advancements speed up molecular dynamics calculations on system sizes of practical relevance by up to a factor of 18.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Simplification of Linearized Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearized Coupled Cluster Doubles (LinCCD) often provides near-singular energies in small-gap systems that exhibit static correlation. This has been attributed to the lack of quadratic $T_2^2$ terms that typically balance out small energy denominators in the CCD amplitude equations. Herein, I show that exchange contributions to ring and crossed-ring contractions (not small denominators per se) cause the divergent behavior of LinCC(S)D approaches. Rather than omitting exchange terms, I recommend a regular and size-consistent method that retains only linear ladder diagrams. As LinCCD and configuration interaction doubles (CID) equations are isomorphic, this also implies that simplification (rather than quadratic extensions) of CID amplitude equations can lead to a size-consistent theory. Linearized ladder CCD (LinLCCD) is robust in statically-correlated systems and can be made $O(n_{\text{occ}}^4n_{\text{vir}}^2)$ with a hole-hole approximation. The relationship between LinLCCD and random-phase approximation sets the stage for the development of next-generation double-hybrid density functionals that can describe static correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>
