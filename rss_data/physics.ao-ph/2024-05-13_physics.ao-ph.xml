      <title>CloudSense: A Model for Cloud Type Identification using Machine Learning from Radar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of type of precipitating cloud is crucial for radar based quantitative estimates of precipitation. We propose a novel model called CloudSense which uses machine learning to accurately identify the type of precipitating clouds over the complex terrain locations in the Western Ghats (WGs) of India. CloudSense uses vertical reflectivity profiles collected during July-August 2018 from an X-band radar to classify clouds into four categories namely stratiform,mixed stratiform-convective,convective and shallow clouds. The machine learning(ML) model used in CloudSense was trained using a dataset balanced by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), with features selected based on physical characteristics relevant to different cloud types. Among various ML models evaluated Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) demonstrate superior performance in classifying cloud types with a BAC of 0.8 and F1-Score of 0.82. CloudSense generated results are also compared against conventional radar algorithms and we find that CloudSense performs better than radar algorithms. For 200 samples tested, the radar algorithm achieved a BAC of 0.69 and F1-Score of 0.68, whereas CloudSense achieved a BAC and F1-Score of 0.77. Our results show that ML based approach can provide more accurate cloud detection and classification which would be useful to improve precipitation estimates over the complex terrain of the WG.</description>

      <title>EWMoE: An effective model for global weather forecasting with mixture-of-experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a crucial task for meteorologic research, with direct social and economic impacts. Recently, data-driven weather forecasting models based on deep learning have shown great potential, achieving superior performance compared with traditional numerical weather prediction methods. However, these models often require massive training data and computational resources. In this paper, we propose EWMoE, an effective model for accurate global weather forecasting, which requires significantly less training data and computational resources. Our model incorporates three key components to enhance prediction accuracy: meteorology-specific embedding, a core Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer, and two specific loss functions. We conduct our evaluation on the ERA5 dataset using only two years of training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EWMoE outperforms current models such as FourCastNet and ClimaX at all forecast time, achieving competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art Pangu-Weather model in evaluation metrics such as Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Additionally, ablation studies indicate that applying the MoE architecture to weather forecasting offers significant advantages in improving accuracy and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Nonhydrostatic and Mass Conserving Ground-to-Thermosphere Dynamical Core based on Specific Internal Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a deep-atmosphere, nonhydrostatic dynamical core (DyCore) targeted towards ground-thermosphere atmospheric prediction. This DyCore is based on a novel formulation of the specific internal energy equation (SIEE), which, unlike standard potential temperature formulations, is valid for variable composition atmospheres. Two versions of a SIEE are derived from basic principles. The first version, which uses a product-rule (PR) continuity equation, contains an additional compressible term and does not conserve mass. The second version, which does not use the product-rule (No-PR) in the continuity equation, contains two compressible terms and conserves mass to machine precision regardless of time truncation error. The pressure gradient and gravitational forces in the momentum balance equation are formulated in a manner appropriate for HA applications and the spectral element method (SEM) is used with Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) and Horizontally Explicit Vertically Implicit (HEVI) time-integration. These new equation sets were implemented in two U. S. Navy atmospheric models: the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA) and the Navy Environmental Prediction sysTem Using a Nonhydrostatic Core (NEPTUNE). Numerical results using a nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic baroclinic instability, a balanced zonal flow, and HA mountain wave experiments are shown. These results are compared to existing deep-atmosphere dynamical cores, indicating that the proposed discretized IEE equation sets are viable next-generation ground-to-thermosphere DyCores.</description>

      <title>Decomposing weather forecasting into advection and convection with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational weather forecasting models have advanced for decades on both the explicit numerical solvers and the empirical physical parameterization schemes. However, the involved high computational costs and uncertainties in these existing schemes are requiring potential improvements through alternative machine learning methods. Previous works use a unified model to learn the dynamics and physics of the atmospheric model. Contrarily, we propose a simple yet effective machine learning model that learns the horizontal movement in the dynamical core and vertical movement in the physical parameterization separately. By replacing the advection with a graph attention network and the convection with a multi-layer perceptron, our model provides a new and efficient perspective to simulate the transition of variables in atmospheric models. We also assess the model's performance over a 5-day iterative forecasting. Under the same input variables and training methods, our model outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significantly-reduced number of parameters with a resolution of 5.625 deg. Overall, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts that leverage machine learning techniques for improving both the accuracy and efficiency of global weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination, and vibrational excitation of CO$^{+}$: model calculations and comparison with experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest molecular data - potential energy curves and Rydberg$/$valence interactions - characterizing the super-excited electronic states of CO are reviewed, in order to provide inputs for the study of their fragmentation dynamics. Starting from this input, the main paths and mechanisms for CO$^+$ dissociative recombination are analyzed; its cross sections are computed using a method based on Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory. Convoluted cross sections, giving both isotropic and anisotropic Maxwellian rate-coefficients, are compared with merged-beam and storage-ring experimental results. The calculated cross sections underestimate the measured ones by a factor of $2$, but display a very similar resonant shape. These facts confirm the quality of our approach for the dynamics, and call for more accurate and more extensive molecular structure calculations.</description>
