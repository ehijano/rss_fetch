      <title>Surface phase diagram of CsSnI$_3$ from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CsSnI$_3$ is widely studied as an environmentally friendly Pb-free perovskite material for optoelectronic device applications. To further improve material and device performance, it is important to understand the surface structures of CsSnI$_3$. We generate surface structures with various stoichiometries, perform density functional theory calculations to create phase diagrams of the CsSnI$_3$ (001), (110), and (100) surfaces, and determine the most stable surfaces under a wide range of Cs, Sn, and I chemical potentials. Under I-rich conditions, surfaces with Cs vacancies are stable, which lead to partially occupied surface states above the valence band maximum. Under I-poor conditions, we find the stoichiometric (100) surface to be stable under a wide region of the phase diagram, which does not have any surface states and can contribute to long charge carrier lifetimes. Consequently, the I-poor (Sn-rich) conditions will be more beneficial to improve the device performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence by magnetic fluctuations in a candidate axion insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can open an energy gap in the topological surface spectrum. In the resulting state, exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses are expected to emerge. A detailed understanding of the magnetic order and its coupling to the topological surface states is essential to harness and tune these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant electric quadrupole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, where two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the N\'eel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Solar Cell Efficiencies of Black Phosphorus and Silicon at the Nano and Micro Scales from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory and many-body (GW+BSE) calculations of transmittance, absorbance, and reflectance are performed on silicon and black phosphorus (BP). We find that a damping value of 0.01 used in the dielectric function calculation is the optimal for calculating the solar cell efficiency of Si. Our calculations indicate that the solar cell efficiency of a 100 {\mu}m thick Si slab is 27.4% while the efficiency of BP for the same thickness is 2.33% and 1.94% for light polarized along the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. For 100 nm thick materials, we obtain that Si presents a 0.8% solar cell efficiency and BP exhibits a 0.14% and 1.02% efficiency for light polarized along the the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively, indicating that BP performs better than Si at these small scales. Our results underscore the important effect of the material thickness on solar cell efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Segregation at prior austenite grain boundaries: the competition between boron and hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between boron and hydrogen at grain boundaries has been investigated experimentally and numerically in boron-doped and boron-free martensitic steels using thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) and ab initio calculations. The calculations show that boron, which mostly segregates into prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGBs), repels hydrogen. This behavior has also been observed using TDS measurements, with the disappearance of one peak when boron is incorporated into the microstructure. Additionally, the microstructure of both boron-doped and boron-free steels has been studied through electron backscattered diffraction, electron channeling contrast imaging, synchrotron X-ray measurements, and atom probe tomography. While both steels have a similar grain size, grain boundary distribution, and dislocation densities, pronounced boron segregation into PAGBs is observed for boron-doped steels. Therefore, the equilibrium hydrogen concentration in different trapping sites has been evaluated using the Langmuir-McLean approximation. This thermodynamic model shows that the distribution of hydrogen is identical for all traps when the total hydrogen concentration is low for boron-free steel. However, when it increases, traps of the lowest segregation energies (mostly PAGBs) are firstly saturated, which promotes failure initiation at this defect type. This finding partially explains why PAGBs are the weakest microstructure feature when martensitic steels are exposed to hydrogen-containing environments.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional to bulk crossover of the WSe$_2$ electronic band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD) are layered materials obtained by stacking two-dimensional sheets weakly bonded by van der Waals interactions. In bulk TMD, band dispersions are observed in the direction normal to the sheet plane (z-direction) due to the hybridization of out-of-plane orbitals but no kz-dispersion is expected at the single-layer limit. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we precisely address the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover of the electronic band structure of epitaxial WSe$_2$ thin films. Increasing number of discrete electronic states appears in given kz-ranges while increasing the number of layers. The continuous bulk dispersion is nearly retrieved for 6-sheet films. These results are reproduced by calculations going from a relatively simple tight-binding model to a sophisticated KKR-Green's function calculation. This two-dimensional system is hence used as a benchmark to compare different theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian fluctuations of quantum anharmonic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) describes atoms in solids, including quantum fluctuations and anharmonic effects, in a non-perturbative way. It computes ionic free energy variationally, constraining the atomic quantum-thermal fluctuations to be Gaussian. Consequently, the entropy is analytical; there is no need for thermodynamic integration or heavy diagonalization to include finite temperature effects. In addition, as the probability distribution is fixed, SCHA solves all the equations with Monte Carlo integration without employing Metropolis sampling of the quantum phase space. Unfortunately, the Gaussian approximation breaks down for rotational modes and tunneling effects. We show how to describe these non-Gaussian fluctuations using the quantum variational principle at finite temperatures, keeping the main advantage of SCHA: direct access to free energy. Our method, nonlinear SCHA (NLSCHA), employs an invertible nonlinear transformation to map Cartesian coordinates into an auxiliary manifold parametrized by a finite set of variables. So, we adopt a Gaussian \textit{ansatz} for the density matrix in this new coordinate system. The nonlinearity of the mapping ensures that NLSCHA enlarges the SCHA variational subspace, and its invertibility conserves the information encoded in the density matrix. We evaluate the entropy in the auxiliary space, where it has a simple analytical form. As in the SCHA, the variational principle allows for optimizing free parameters to minimize free energy. Finally, we show that, for the first time, NLSCHA gives direct access to the entropy of a crystal with non-Gaussian degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Force-Matching Based Polarizable and Non-Polarizable Force Fields for Perovskite and Non-Perovskite Phases of CsPbI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have emerged as highly efficient solar cell materials. However, to date, the most promising members of this class are polymorphs, in which a wide-band gap $\delta$ phase competes with the photoactive perovskite $\alpha$ form, and the intrinsic physical interactions that stabilize one phase over the other are currently not well understood. Classical molecular dynamics simulations based on suitably parameterized force fields (FF) enable computational studies over broad temperature (and pressure) ranges and can help to identify the underlying factors that govern relative phase stability at the atomic level. In this article, we present a polarizable (pol) as well as a non-polarizable (npol) FF for the all-inorganic lead halide material CsPbI$_3$ as a prototype system exhibiting a $\delta$/$\alpha$ polymorphism. Both npol and pol FFs have been determined using a force-matching approach based on reference data from first-principles molecular dynamics simulations over a wide range of temperatures. While both FFs are able to describe the perovskite as well as the non-perovskite phase, finer structural details as well as the relative phase stability are better reproduced with the polarizable version. A comparison of these ab initio-derived interatomic potentials allows direct insights into the physical origin of the interactions that govern the interplay between the two competing phases. It turns out that explicit polarization is the essential factor that stabilizes the strongly anisotropic $\delta$ phase over the high symmetry perovskite $\alpha$ phase at lower temperatures. This fundamental difference between $\alpha$ and $\delta$ phase appears universal and might thus also hold for other perovskite compounds with $\delta$/$\alpha$ polymorphism and thus provide rational guidance for synthetic efforts to stabilize the photoactive perovskite phase at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely believed that the skyrmion Hall effect is absent in antiferromagnets because of the vanishing topological charge. However, the Aharonov-Casher theory indicates the possibility of topological effects for neutral particles. In this work, we predict the skyrmion Hall effect in emerging altermagnets with zero net magnetization and zero skyrmion charge. We first show that the neutral skyrmion manifests as a magnetic quadrupole in altermagnets. We reveal a hidden gauge field from the magnetic quadrupole, which induces the skyrmion Hall effect when driven by spin transfer torque. Interestingly, we identify a sign change of the Hall angle when one swaps the anisotropic exchange couplings in altermagnets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the velocity and Hall angle of altermagnetic skyrmions sensitively depend on the current direction. Our findings real the critical role of magnetic quadrupole in driving the skyrmion Hall effect with vanishing charge, and pave the way to discovering new Hall effect of neutral quasiparticles beyond magnetic skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of bulk and grain boundary diffusion in solid electrolyte \texorpdfstring{Li\textsubscript{6}PS\textsubscript{5}Cl}{Li6PS5Cl} using machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li\textsubscript{6}PS\textsubscript{5}Cl is a promising candidate for the solid electrolyte in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. In applications, this material is in a polycrystalline state with grain boundaries (GBs) that can affect ionic conductivity. While atomistic modeling provides valuable information on the impact of GBs on Li diffusion, such studies face either high computational cost (\textit{ab initio} methods) or accuracy limitations (classical potentials) as challenges. Here, we develop a quality-level-based active learning scheme for efficient and systematic development of \textit{ab initio}-based machine-learning interatomic potentials, specifically moment tensor potentials (MTPs), for large-scale, long-time, and high-accuracy simulations of complex atomic structures and diffusion mechanisms as encountered in solid electrolytes. Based on this scheme, we obtain MTPs for Li\textsubscript{6}PS\textsubscript{5}Cl and investigate two tilt GBs, $\Sigma3(1\bar{1}2)[110]$, $\Sigma3(\bar{1}11)[110]$, and one twist GB, $\Sigma5(001)[001]$. All three GBs exhibit low formation energies of less than \SI{20}{meV/\angstrom\textsuperscript{2}}, indicating their high stability in polycrystalline Li\textsubscript{6}PS\textsubscript{5}Cl. Using the MTPs, diffusion coefficients of the anion-ordered and anion-disordered bulk, as well as the three GBs, are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of atomistic models. At \SI{300}{\kelvin}, the GB diffusion coefficients fall between the ones of the anion-ordered bulk structure (\SI{0.012e-7}{cm^2/s}, corresponding ionic conductivity about \SI{0.2}{mS/cm}) and the anion-disordered bulk structure (\SI{50}{\percent} Cl/S-anion disorder; \SI{2.203e-7}{cm^2/s}, about \SI{29.8}{mS/cm}) of Li\textsubscript{6}PS\textsubscript{5}Cl. Experimental data fall between the Arrhenius-extrapolated diffusion coefficients of the investigated atomic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-throughput automation of ab-initio impurity embedding simulations, we created a database of $3d$ and $4d$ transition metal defects embedded into the prototypical topological insulator (TI) Bi$_2$Te$_3$. We simulate both single impurities as well as impurity dimers at different impurity-impurity distances inside the TI. We extract changes to magnetic moments, analyze the polarizability of non-magnetic impurity atoms via nearby magnetic impurity atoms and calculate the exchange coupling constants for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We uncover chemical trends in the exchange coupling constants and discuss the impurities' potential with respect to magnetic order in the fields of quantum anomalous Hall insulators and topological quantum computing. In particular, we predict that co-doping of different magnetic dopants is a viable strategy to engineer the magnetic ground state in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves, or magnons, are fundamental excitations in magnetic materials that provide insights into their dynamic properties and interactions. Magnons are the building blocks of magnonics, which offer promising perspectives for data storage, quantum computing, and communication technologies. These excitations are typically measured through inelastic neutron or x-ray scattering techniques, which involve heavy and time-consuming measurements, data processing, and analysis based on various theoretical models. Here, we introduce a machine learning algorithm that integrates adaptive noise reduction and active learning sampling, which enables the restoration from minimal inelastic neutron scattering point data of spin wave information and the accurate extraction of magnetic parameters, including hidden interactions. Our findings, benchmarked against the magnon spectra of CrSBr, significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy in addressing complex and noisy experimental measurements. This advancement offers a powerful machine learning tool for research in magnonics and spintronics, which can also be extended to other characterization techniques at large facilities.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithography Pattering Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (EBD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</description>

      <title>More is Different: Mobile Ions Improve the Design Tolerances of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent advances in metal halide perovskite solar cell (PSC) performance are attributed to surface treatments which passivate interfacial trap states, minimise charge recombination and boost photovoltages. Surprisingly, these photovoltages exceed the cells' built-in potentials, often with large energetic offsets reported between the perovskite and transport layer semiconductor band edges - contradicting standard photovoltaic design principles. Here we show that this tolerance to energetic offsets results from mixed ionic/electronic conduction in the perovskite layer. Combining drift-diffusion simulations with experiments probing the current-voltage performance of PSCs as a function of ion distribution, we demonstrate that electrostatic redistribution of ionic charge reduces surface recombination currents at steady-state, increasing the photovoltage by tens to hundreds of millivolts. Thus, mobile ions can reduce the sensitivity of photovoltage to energetic misalignments at perovskite/transport layer interfaces, benefitting overall efficiency. Building on these insights, we show how photovoltaic design principles are modified to account for mobile ions.</description>

      <title>Structural Constraint Integration in Generative Model for Discovery of Quantum Material Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billions of organic molecules are known, but only a tiny fraction of the functional inorganic materials have been discovered, a particularly relevant problem to the community searching for new quantum materials. Recent advancements in machine-learning-based generative models, particularly diffusion models, show great promise for generating new, stable materials. However, integrating geometric patterns into materials generation remains a challenge. Here, we introduce Structural Constraint Integration in the GENerative model (SCIGEN). Our approach can modify any trained generative diffusion model by strategic masking of the denoised structure with a diffused constrained structure prior to each diffusion step to steer the generation toward constrained outputs. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that SCIGEN effectively performs conditional sampling from the original distribution, which is crucial for generating stable constrained materials. We generate eight million compounds using Archimedean lattices as prototype constraints, with over 10% surviving a multi-staged stability pre-screening. High-throughput density functional theory (DFT) on 26,000 survived compounds shows that over 50% passed structural optimization at the DFT level. Since the properties of quantum materials are closely related to geometric patterns, our results indicate that SCIGEN provides a general framework for generating quantum materials candidates.</description>

      <title>Median Mishaps between Chirality and Spin-Orbit Torques via Asymmetric Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Averaged observations of physical phenomena have been utilized for comprehending specific occurrences in nature; however, these may overlook the crucial characteristics of individual events, thereby leading to diverse conclusions. For example, individual wave occurrences such as superposition and interference yield markedly divergent outcomes when viewed in detail. Similarly, this study enhances the comprehensive framework of spin-orbit torque (SOT) within the hysteresis loop shift measurement by employing the average of effective magnetic fields arising from two distinct magnetic reversals. This approach facilitates the presentation of a physically descriptive SOT model, previously characterized only by single chirality qualitatively. By integrating this model with established measurement methodologies and theoretical paradigms, we advance a theoretical framework based on the magnetic domain-wall chirality of individual polarizations and aim to elucidate the phenomena of SOT with clarity. The anticipated outcomes include the rectification of inaccuracies in widely employed measurement methodologies and the enhancement of our comprehension of the fundamental physics, which are expected to propel advancements in next-generation spintronics materials and devices.</description>

      <title>An autoencoder for compressing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data</title>

Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental technique to determine the electronic structure of solids. Advances in light sources for ARPES experiments are currently leading to a vast increase of data acquisition rates and data quantity. On the other hand, access time to the most advanced ARPES instruments remains strictly limited, calling for fast, effective, and on-the-fly data analysis tools to exploit this time. In response to this need, we introduce ARPESNet, a versatile autoencoder network that efficiently summmarises and compresses ARPES datasets. We train ARPESNet on a large and varied dataset of 2-dimensional ARPES data extracted by cutting standard 3-dimensional ARPES datasets along random directions in $\mathbf{k}$. To test the data representation capacity of ARPESNet, we compare $k$-means clustering quality between data compressed by ARPESNet, data compressed by discrete cosine transform, and raw data, at different noise levels. ARPESNet data excels in clustering quality despite its high compression ratio.</description>

      <title>Efficient Materials Informatics between Rockets and Electrons</title>

Abstract: The true power of computational research typically can lay in either what it accomplishes or what it enables others to accomplish. In this work, both avenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics infrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2) deployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in an autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and CALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.
  The resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as it focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an existing solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of multi-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high temperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet engine efficiency increase reducing CO2 emissions, as well as hypersonic vehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical space using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to many problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase relations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest quality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a data ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million relaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations and improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new efficient featurization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of oscillatory instability called \lq flutter' was observed in aeroelasticity and rotor dynamics about a century ago. Driven by a series of applications involving nonconservative elasticity theory at different physical scales, ranging from nanomechanics to the mechanics of large space structures and including biomechanical problems of motility and growth, research on flutter is experiencing a new renaissance. A review is presented of the most notable applications and recent advances in fundamentals, both theoretical and experimental aspects, of flutter instability and Hopf bifurcation. Open problems, research gaps, and new perspectives for investigations are indicated.</description>

      <title>Geometry fluctuations in chiral superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of chiral superfluids and superconductors to the background geometry leads to surprising geometric induction phenomena. We show that this coupling bears important consequences even in a nearly flat background, through its signature in thermal fluctuations. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of a chiral superfluid minimally coupled to the background geometry, we show that the interaction strength between vortices gets renormalized by geometry fluctuations. In our setup, these arise from the shape fluctuations of the underlying two-dimensional substrate, and are controlled by its bending rigidity and tension. In the tensionless limit, the fluctuations lower the vortex interaction strength at large distances, which leads to a lowering of the BKT transition temperature. We study this effect in terms of the renormalization group flow of a dual sine-Gordon theory of the superfluid transition coupled to the substrate shape. It shows that, in turn, the chiral superfluid order can suppress the amplitude of shape fluctuations, resulting in an extended phase diagram which links the superfluid transition to the crumpling transition of the substrate. These reveal thermodynamic signatures of chirality in the superfluid transition.</description>

      <title>Observation of exceptional line semimetal in three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological phases, which exhibit unique features such as skin effect and exceptional points originated from nontrivial band topologies in complex plane, have attracted enormous attention in condensed-matter physics and metamaterials. Here we report the realization of an exceptional line semimetal in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystal. A pair of exceptional rings with opposite topologies are connected by the drumhead bulk states in the first Brillouin zone. The exceptional rings not only possess wave-function topology and thus result in the drumhead surface states, but also host spectral topology and thereby give rise to the hybrid-order geometry-dependent skin effect in three dimensions. Our experimental results evidence the complete non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence of the three-dimensional exceptional line semimetal, and may pave the way for designing non-Hermitian acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac-Pauli physics in lead-halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the so-called non-minimal (Pauli) coupling is suppressed for elementary particles and has no physical implications. Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known family of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel playground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable manifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) the Klein paradox and (ii) relativistic corrections to bound states. In particular, we demonstrate that the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a positively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of lead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term. Our study adds to understanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the way for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.</description>

      <title>Layer-Dependent Charge State Lifetime of Single Se Vacancies in WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect engineering in two-dimensional semiconductors has been exploited to tune the optoelectronic properties and introduce new quantum states in the band gap. Chalcogen vacancies in transition metal dichalcogenides in particular have been found to strongly impact charge carrier concentration and mobility in 2D transistors as well as feature sub-gap emission and single-photon response. In this letter, we investigate the layer-dependent charge state lifetime of Se vacancies in WSe$_2$. In one monolayer WSe$_2$, we observe ultrafast charge transfer from the lowest unoccupied orbital of the top Se vacancy to the graphene substrate within (1.0 $\pm$ 0.2) ps measured via the current saturation in scanning tunneling approach curves. For Se vacancies decoupled by TMD multilayers, we find a sub-exponential increase of the charge lifetime from (62 $\pm$ 14) ps in bilayer to few nanoseconds in four-layer WSe$_2$, alongside a reduction of the defect state binding energy. Additionally, we attribute the continuous suppression and energy shift of the dI/dV in-gap defect state resonances at very close tip--sample distances to a current saturation effect. Our results provide a key measure of the layer-dependent charge transfer rate of chalcogen vacancies in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Giant Second Harmonic Generation from Wafer-Scale Aligned Chiral Carbon Nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are direct-gap semiconductors with optical properties governed by one-dimensional excitons with enormous oscillator strengths. Each species of chiral CNTs has an enantiomeric pair of left- and right-handed CNTs with nearly identical properties, but enantiomer-dependent phenomena can emerge, especially in nonlinear optical processes. Theoretical studies have predicted strong second-order nonlinearities for chiral CNTs, but there has been no experimental verification due to the lack of macroscopically ordered assemblies of single-enantiomer chiral CNTs. Here for the first time, we report the synthesis of centimeter-scale films of densely packed and aligned single-enantiomer chiral CNTs that exhibit micro-fabrication compatibility. We observe giant second harmonic generation (SHG) emission from the chiral CNT film, which originates from the intrinsic chirality and inversion symmetry breaking of the atomic structure of chiral CNTs. The observed value of the dominant element of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor reaches $1.5\times 10^{3}$ pm/V at a pump wavelength of 1030 nm, corresponding to the lowest-energy excitonic resonance. Our calculations based on many-body theory correctly estimate the spectrum and magnitude of such excitonically enhanced optical nonlinearity. These results are promising for developing scalable chiral-CNT electronics, nonlinear photonics and photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects and temperature dependence of the free energy barrier and shear frequency in bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Surface-Functionalization of Oleate-Capped Nano-Emitters for Stable Dispersion in 3D-Printable Polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing is a well-known technique for fabricating passive micro/nanoscale structures, such as microlenses and inversely designed polarization splitters. The integration of light emitting nanoparticle (NP) dopants, such as quantum dots (QDs) and rare-earth doped nanoparticles (RENPs), into a polymer resist would enable 3D printing of active polymer micro-photonic devices, including sensors, lasers, and solid-state displays. Many NPs are stabilized with oleic acid ligands to prevent degradation, but oleate-capped NPs (oc-NPs) tend to agglomerate in nonpolar media despite the hydrophobicity of the ligand. This results in an uneven distribution of NPs in polymers and increased optical extinction properties. In this work, we propose a general approach for dispersing various oc-NPs in commercial 3D printable polymers. We achieve controlled growth of small carbon chains around the oc-NPs by functionalizing the NPs with methyl-methacrylate monomers. The proposed approach is validated on RENPs (~65 nm) and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (~12 nm) using different commercial polymer resists (IP-Dip and IP-Visio). Dispersions of functionalized NPs (f-NPs) have improved NP density by an order of magnitude and are shown to be stable for several weeks with minimal impact on printing quality. Our approach is generalizable to a variety of oc-NPs and ultimately leads to higher quality polymer-based optical and electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategies to achieve higher upper-critical-field superconductors ({\mu}0Hc2(0)) are of great interest for both fundamental science and practical applications. While reducing the thickness of two-dimensional (2D) materials to a few layers significantly enhances {\mu}0Hc2(0) with accompanied potential unconventional pairing mechanisms, further dimensional reduction to 1D compounds rarely exceeds the expected Pauli limit. Here, we report the discovery of a 1D granular Ta-Te nanowire that becomes superconducting under high pressure, with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of 5.1 K. Remarkably, the {\mu}0Hc2(0) reaches 16 T, which is twice the Pauli limit, setting a record of {\mu}0Hc2 (0) in all the reported 1D superconductors. Our work demonstrates that the Ta-Te nanowire not only is a potential candidate for applications in high magnetic fields, but also provides an ideal platform for further investigations of the mechanisms between nanowires and large {\mu}0Hc2(0).</description>

      <title>Resistive switching suppression in metal/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ Schottky contacts prepared by room-temperature Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepening the understanding of interface-type Resistive Switching (RS) in metal/oxide heterojunctions is a key step for the development of high-performance memristors and Schottky rectifiers. In this study, we address the role of metallization technique by fabricating prototypical metal/Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (M/NSTO) Schottky contacts via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Ultrathin Pt and Au electrodes are deposited by PLD onto single-crystal (001)-terminated NSTO substrates and interfacial transport is characterized by conventional macroscale methods and nanoscale Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy. We show that PLD metallization gives Schottky contacts with highly reversible current-voltage characteristics under cyclic polarization. Room-temperature transport is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky barrier height $\phi_B$(Pt/NSTO)=0.71-0.75eV, $\phi_B$(Au/NSTO)=0.70-0.83eV and ideality factors as small as n(Pt/NSTO)=1.1 and n(Au/NSTO)=1.6. RS remains almost completely suppressed upon imposing broad variations of the Nb doping and of the external stimuli (polarization bias, working temperature, ambient air exposure). At the nanoscale, we find that both systems display high spatial homogeneity of $\phi_B$(&lt;50meV), which is only partially affected by the NSTO mixed termination (|$\phi_B$ (M/SrO) - $\phi_B$ (M/TiO$_2$)|&lt;35meV). Experimental evidences and theoretical arguments indicate that the PLD metallization mitigates interfacial layer effects responsible for RS. This occurs thanks either to a reduction of the interfacial layer thickness and to the creation of an effective barrier against the permeation of ambient gas species affecting charge trapping and redox reactions. This description allows to rationalize interfacial aging effects, observed upon several-months-exposure to ambient air, in terms of interfacial re-oxidation.</description>

      <title>The miscibility of hydrogen and water in planetary atmospheres and interiors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many planets in the solar system and across the galaxy have hydrogen-rich atmospheres overlying more heavy element-rich interiors with which they interact for billions of years. Atmosphere-interior interactions are thus crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of these bodies. However, this understanding is still lacking in part because the relevant pressure-temperature conditions are extreme. We conduct molecular dynamics simulations based on Density Functional Theory to investigate how hydrogen and water interact over a wide range of pressure and temperature, encompassing the interiors of Neptune-sized and smaller planets. We determine the critical curve at which a single homogeneous phase exsolves into two separate, hydrogen-rich and water-rich phases, finding good agreement with existing experimental data. We find that the temperature along the critical curve increases with increasing pressure and shows the influence of a change in fluid structure from molecular to atomic near 30 GPa and 3000 K, which may impact magnetic field generation. The internal temperatures of many exoplanets, including TOI-270 d and K2-18 b may lie entirely above the critical curve: the envelope is expected to consist of a single homogeneous hydrogen-water fluid, that is much less susceptible to atmospheric loss as compared with a pure hydrogen envelope. As planets cool, they cross the critical curve, leading to rainout of water-rich fluid and an increase in internal luminosity. Compositions of the resulting outer, hydrogen-rich, and inner, water-rich envelopes depend on age and instellation and are governed by thermodynamics. Rainout of water may be occurring in Uranus and Neptune at present.</description>

In this work, we investigate the effect of an in-plane electric field on the exciton resonance states in MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) monolayers and few-layers using the complex coordinate rotation method and the Lagrange-Laguerre polynomial expansion of the wave function. The exciton properties are well described within the Mott-Wannier model incorporating the nonlocal Keldysh potential. Our calculations reveal that an electric field effectively dissociates excitons, with excited states being more easily dissociated than the ground state. The critical field for exciton dissociation is found to be smaller in WX$_2$ monolayers compared to MoX$_2$ monolayers due to the smaller exciton reduced mass. Furthermore, the presence of a dielectric substrate and an increase in the number of MX$_2$ layers enhance the exciton susceptibility to the electric field, lowering the critical field for dissociation. The dependence of exciton properties on the number of MX$_2$ layers can be well described by power functions. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance optoelectronic devices based on 2D TMDs.</description>

      <title>An energy-dependent broadening of Rashba-like spin splitting in Au2Sb surface alloy with periodic structural defect</title>

Abstract: Here, we report a novel AuSb 2D superstructure on Au(111) that shows agreements and discrepancies to the expected electronic features of the ideal 2D surface alloys with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a spin splitting of the alloy bands with antiparallel spin polarization, stemming from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. However, the observed Rashba bands are significantly broadened. Taking advantage of the good agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, we determine that the broadening of the Rashba band is due to the perturbations from the 3-pointed-star-shaped defects acting as nonresonant impurities in the Au2Sb superstructure. These periodic defects can shift the energy position of the Rashba band without breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry, which suggests that introducing periodic defects into a Rashba SOC system possesses a great potential in engineering the spin-dependent properties of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Layer-number and strain effects on the structural and electronic properties of PtSe2 material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bandgap engineering of low-dimensional materials forms a robust basis for advancements in optoelectronic technologies. Platinum diselenide (PtSe2) material exhibits a transition from semi-metal to semiconductor (SM-SC) when going from bulk to monolayer (ML). In this work, density functional theory (DFT) with various van der Waals (vdW) corrections has been tested to study the effect of the layer-number on the structural and electronic properties of the PtSe2 material. The considered vdW corrections gave different results regarding the number of layers at which the SM-SC transition occurs. This variation is due to the different interlayer distances found for each correction, revealing the sensitivity of the bandgap to this distance in addition to the layer number. In fact, the bandgap increases with the increasing of the interlayer distance, due to the energy shift of conduction and valence bands dominated by Se-pz orbitals. According to the comparison with the available experimental data, the vdW corrections vdW-DF and rVV10 gave the most accurate results. Moreover, the control of the interlayer distance via vertical compressive strain led to the bandgap tuning of semiconductor PtSe2 BL. Indeed, a semi-metal character of PtSe2 BL can be obtained under 17% vertical strain. Our work shows a deep understanding of the correlation between the structural and electronic properties, and thus a possibility to tune the bandgap by strain means.</description>

      <title>Design principles of nonlinear optical materials for Terahertz lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated both inter-band and intra-band second order nonlinear optical conductivity based on the velocity correlation formalism and the spectral expansion technique. We propose a scenario in which the second order intra-band process is nonzero while the inter-band process is zero. This occurs for a band structure with momentum asymmetry in the Brillouin zone. Very low-energy photons are blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle from participating in the inter-band process; however, they are permitted to participate in the intra-band process, with the band smeared by some impurity scattering. We establish a connection between the inter-band nonlinear optical conductivity in the velocity gauge and the shift vector in the length gauge for a two-band model. Using a quasiclassical kinetic approach, we demonstrate the importance of intra-band transitions in high harmonic generations for the single tilted Dirac cone model and hexagonal warping model. We confirm that the Kramers-Kronig relations break down for the limit case of ($\omega$, $-\omega$) in the nonlinear optical conductivity. Finally, we calculate the superconducting transition temperature of NbN and the dielectric function of AlN, and the resistance of the NbN/AlN junction. The natural non-linearity of the Josephson junction brings a Josephson plasma with frequency in the Terahertz region.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-magnon interactions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets offer the unprecedented opportunity to study interactions between collective modes that in standard bulk ferromagnets do not cross paths. Indeed, they harbor an optical spin-wave branch, i.e. a spin wave which disperses weakly near the Brillouin zone center. When doped with free carriers, they also host the typical gapless plasmonic mode of 2D itinerant electron/hole systems. When the plasmon branch meets the optical spin-wave branch, energy and momentum matching occurs, paving the way for interactions between the charge and spin sector. In this Letter we present a microscopic theory of such plasmon-magnon interactions, which is based on a double random phase approximation. We comment on the possibility to unveil this physics in recently isolated 2D honeycomb magnets such as ${\rm Cr}_2{\rm Ge}_2{\rm Te}_6$.</description>

      <title>Bounds to electron spin qubit variability for scalable CMOS architectures</title>

Abstract: Spins of electrons in CMOS quantum dots combine exquisite quantum properties and scalable fabrication. In the age of quantum technology, however, the metrics that crowned Si/SiO2 as the microelectronics standard need to be reassessed with respect to their impact upon qubit performance. We chart the spin qubit variability due to the unavoidable atomic-scale roughness of the Si/SiO$_2$ interface, compiling experiments in 12 devices, and developing theoretical tools to analyse these results. Atomistic tight binding and path integral Monte Carlo methods are adapted for describing fluctuations in devices with millions of atoms by directly analysing their wavefunctions and electron paths instead of their energy spectra. We correlate the effect of roughness with the variability in qubit position, deformation, valley splitting, valley phase, spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling. These variabilities are found to be bounded and lie within the tolerances for scalable architectures for quantum computing as long as robust control methods are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Measuring Trotter error and its application to precision-guaranteed Hamiltonian simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotterization is the most common and convenient approximation method for Hamiltonian simulations on digital quantum computers, but estimating its error accurately is computationally difficult for large quantum systems. Here, we develop a method for measuring the Trotter error without ancillary qubits on quantum circuits by combining the $m$th- and $n$th-order ($m&lt;n$) Trotterizations rather than consulting with mathematical error bounds. Using this method, we make Trotterization precision-guaranteed, developing an algorithm named Trotter$(m,n)$, in which the Trotter error at each time step is within an error tolerance $\epsilon$ preset for our purpose. Trotter$(m,n)$ is applicable to both time- independent and dependent Hamiltonians, and it adaptively chooses almost the largest stepsize $\mathrm{d}t$, which keeps quantum circuits shallowest within the error tolerance. Benchmarking it in a quantum spin chain, we find the adaptively chosen $\mathrm{d}t$ to be about ten times larger than that inferred from known upper bounds of Trotter errors.</description>

      <title>A peridynamic investigation of particle oxidation, size and material during cold-spray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold spray technology, distinguished by its unique ability to deposit particles in a solid state, offers unparalleled potential for applications such as coating, repair, and additive manufacturing. In this research, we employed a peridynamic modeling approach to systematically analyze the effects of key powder features on deposit properties. Notably, our model incorporates the explicit modeling of nanometer-sized oxide layers, providing a more accurate representation of real-world conditions. We assessed the influence of parameters such as particle size, oxidation conditions, and material type on crucial deposition indicators like critical velocity and compression ratio. Our results demonstrated excellent agreement with reported experimental data, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed numerical framework. Specifically, our findings highlighted that, for a given impact velocity, smaller particles, thicker oxide layers, and harder materials contribute to limited oxide removal and a decreased likelihood of successful adhesion. Additionally, we present a predictive framework that establishes a correlation between particle size and critical velocity, providing valuable insights for optimizing cold spray deposition parameters. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of the intricate interplay between powder features and deposit properties but also paves the way for a more efficient and cost-effective optimization process in cold spray applications.</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>
