      <title>Chinese Historical Documents Reveal Multi-Century Seasonal Shifts in Tropical Cyclone Landfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paleoclimate records reveal a fuller range of natural climate variability than modern records and are essential for better understanding the modern climate change. However, most paleoclimate records are point-based proxies and lack the temporal resolution needed to analyze spatiotemporal changes in destructive extremes like tropical cyclones (TCs). Here we show that historical records by pre-industrial Chinese intellectuals help investigate long-term variability of TC landfalls in East Asia. Despite inherent limitations, these records show a landfalling TC climatology resembling modern observations in spatial-temporal distributions. Comparisons between the pre-industrial records (1776-1850), modern observations (1946-2020), and climate simulations reveal an earlier seasonal occurrence of modern TCs. However, the variations of seasonally aggregated landfall time show pronounced multi-century variations. The modern changes and multi-decade trends appear moderate compared to long-term variability in pre-industrial TC records, suggesting that an overreliance on modern data may lead to an underestimation of the full range of TC activity potentially arising from natural variability alone. Analyses of newly available climate data reveal associations between past landfalling TC activity and the large-scale climate variability of tropical ocean and extratropical land. These findings demonstrate the value of paleoclimate data for exploring natural variability in TC activity and inform the development of effective adaptation strategies for future climate change.</description>

      <title>Climate network and complexity approach predict neutral ENSO event for 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the strongest driver of interannual global climate variability and can lead to extreme weather events like droughts and flooding. Additionally, ENSO influences the mean global temperature with strong El Ni\~no events often leading, in a warming climate, to new record highs. Recently, we have developed two approaches for the early forecasting of El Ni\~no. The climate network-based approach allows forecasting the onset of an El Ni\~no event about 1 year ahead. The complexity-based approach allows additionally to forecast the magnitude of an upcoming El Ni\~no event in the calendar year before. These methods successfully forecasted the onset of an Eastern Pacific El Ni\~no for 2023/24 and the subsequent record-breaking warming of 2024. Here, we apply these methods to forecast the ENSO state in 2025. Both methods forecast the absence of an El Ni\~no in 2025, with 91.2% and 91.7% probability, respectively. Combining these forecasts with a logistic regression based on the Oceanic Ni\~no Index (ONI) leads to a 69.6% probability that 2025/26 will be a neutral ENSO event. We estimate the probability of a La Ni\~na at 21.8%. This makes it likely that the mean global temperature in 2025 will decrease somewhat compared to the 2024 level.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of turbulence in convectively unstable internal solitary waves of depression shoaling over gentle slopes in the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shoaling of high-amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISW) of depression in the South China Sea (SCS), is examined through large-scale parallel turbulence-resolving high-accuracy simulations. A select, near-isobath-normal, bathymetric transect of the gentle SCS's continental slope is employed together with stratification and current profiles obtained by in-situ measurements. Simulations are conducted using a state-of-the-art high-accuracy hybrid Spectral-Element-Method/Fourier three-dimensional non-linear non-hydrostatic flow solver. Three simulations of separate ISWs with initial deep-water amplitudes in the range [136m, 150m] provide a novel wave-tracking capability for a propagation distance of 80km. While key features of the in-situ observed phenomena are accurately reproduced, additional insights into wave evolution are offered, inaccessible through field observations. The interplay between convective versus shear instability as a function of deep-water ISW amplitude, along with the associated turbulence formation and evolution, are explored. Across all three waves, the convective instability develops in a similar fashion. Heavier water entrained from the wave rear plunges into its interior, giving rise to transient, yet distinct, subsurface vortical structures. Ultimately, a gravity current is triggered which horizontally advances through the wave interior and mixes it down to the base of the pycnocline. Although the waveform remains distinctly symmetric, Kelvin-Helmholtz billows result near the well-mixed ISW trough, disturb the wave's trailing edge, and are linked with an active wake with an intensity nonlinearly dependent on deep-water wave amplitude. Finally, the evolution of the kinetic energy associated with finer-scale velocity perturbations to the ISW shows two different growth regimes, each dominated by either convective or shear instability.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Wind Gust Predictions in the Northeast US: An Evidential Neural Network and Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in reducing bias in numerical weather model predictions of wind gusts. Yet, they underperform to predict high gusts even with additional observations due to the right-skewed distribution of gusts. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) addresses this by identifying when predictions are reliable or needs cautious interpretation. Using data from 61 extratropical storms in the Northeastern USA, we introduce evidential neural network (ENN) as a novel approach for UQ in gust predictions, leveraging atmospheric variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model as features and gust observations as targets. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques demonstrated that key predictive features also contributed to higher uncertainty. Estimated uncertainty correlated with storm intensity and spatial gust gradients. ENN allowed constructing gust prediction intervals without requiring an ensemble. From an operational perspective, providing gust forecasts with quantified uncertainty enhances stakeholders' confidence in risk assessment and response planning for extreme gust events.</description>

      <title>OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, and water resource management. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning methods have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs). By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive information propagation mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions (e.g., typhoons), significantly improving forecast accuracy.

      <title>Shoaling of Finite-Amplitude Rogue Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00400v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rogue wave formation and enhancement over coastal areas have been documented over the last decade. However, this recent knowledge is in apparent contradiction with the established observation of sub-Gaussian wave statistics near shallow water. Current theories and experiments describe the rogue wave amplification near shallow water regimes, but only for small-amplitude waves, and thus, not accounting for wave-breaking processes. To address this gap, we perform experiments to probe inhomogeneous wave fields nearing the wave-breaking regime. We also show that by increasing the significant wave height towards the breaking limit, the kinetic energy grows faster than the variance of the surface elevation due to nonlinearity, providing a physical explanation why the occurrence of rogue wave first increases in shallower waters and suddenly decreases further shorewards.</description>

      <title>Shoreline Responses to Rapid Water Level Increases in Lake Michigan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution multispectral satellite imagery was utilized to quantify shoreline recession at eleven beaches around Lake Michigan during a record-setting water level increase between 2013 and 2020. Shoreline changes during this period ranged from 20 m to 62 m, corresponding to 52-95% of the initial beach widths. Average estimated shoreline erosion across all beaches varied from 1% to 75% of the observed changes, with the remainder attributed to inundation. Significant correlations were found between shoreline erosion and wave-related factors, including offshore wave power, offshore bathymetric slope, storm energy, and potential alongshore sediment transport divergence. In contrast, parameters related to cross-shore transport, such as dimensionless fall velocity, exhibited weak correlations. Additionally, the results underscore the importance of distinguishing between immediately reversible changes (inundation) and morphological changes that could be reversible over longer timescales, when assessing the impact of rising water levels., The findings also suggest that in addition to waves playing a key role in regulating shoreline changes, alongshore sediment transport processes may play a more crucial role in beach erosion during significant water level increases than cross-shore processes, challenging traditional models of beach adjustment to rising waters.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Parameterizing Submesoscale Vertical Buoyancy Fluxes in the Ocean Mixed Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterizations of O(1-10)km submesoscale flows in General Circulation Models (GCMs) represent the effects of unresolved vertical buoyancy fluxes in the ocean mixed layer. These submesoscale flows interact non-linearly with mesoscale and boundary layer turbulence, and it is challenging to account for all the relevant processes in physics-based parameterizations. In this work, we present a data-driven approach for the submesoscale parameterization, that relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to predict mixed layer vertical buoyancy fluxes as a function of relevant large-scale variables. The data used for training is given from 12 regions sampled from the global high-resolution MITgcm-LLC4320 simulation. When compared with the baseline of a submesoscale physics-based parameterization, the CNN demonstrates high offline skill across all regions, seasons, and filter scales tested in this study. During seasons when submesoscales are most active, which generally corresponds to winter and spring months, we find that the CNN prediction skill tends to be lower than in summer months. The CNN exhibits strong dependency on the mixed layer depth and on the large scale strain field, a variable closely related to frontogenesis, which is currently missing from the submesoscale parameterizations in GCMs.</description>

      <title>Stable Machine-Learning Parameterization of Subgrid Processes in a Comprehensive Atmospheric Model Learned From Embedded Convection-Permitting Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern climate projections often suffer from inadequate spatial and temporal resolution due to computational limitations, resulting in inaccurate representations of sub-grid processes. A promising technique to address this is the Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which embeds a kilometer-resolution cloud-resolving model within each atmospheric column of a host climate model to replace traditional convection and cloud parameterizations. Machine learning (ML) offers a unique opportunity to make MMF more accessible by emulating the embedded cloud-resolving model and reducing its substantial computational cost. Although many studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept success of achieving stable hybrid simulations, it remains a challenge to achieve near operational-level success with real geography and comprehensive variable emulation that includes, for example, explicit cloud condensate coupling. In this study, we present a stable hybrid model capable of integrating for at least 5 years with near operational-level complexity, including coarse-grid geography, seasonality, explicit cloud condensate and wind predictions, and land coupling. Our model demonstrates skillful online performance, achieving a 5-year zonal mean tropospheric temperature bias within 2K, water vapor bias within 1 g/kg, and a precipitation RMSE of 0.96 mm/day. Key factors contributing to our online performance include an expressive U-Net architecture and physical thermodynamic constraints for microphysics. With microphysical constraints mitigating unrealistic cloud formation, our work is the first to demonstrate realistic multi-year cloud condensate climatology under the MMF framework. Despite these advances, online diagnostics reveal persistent biases in certain regions, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to further optimize online performance.</description>
