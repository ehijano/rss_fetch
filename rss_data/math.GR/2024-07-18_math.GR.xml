      <title>Unipotent radicals, one-dimensional transitive groups, and solvable factors of classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By developing a tangible way to decompose unipotent radicals into irreducible submodules of Singer cycles, we achieve a classification of solvable factors of finite classical groups of Lie type. This completes previous work on factorizations of classical groups with a solvable factor. In particular, it resolves the final uncertain case in the long-standing problem of determining exact factorizations of almost simple groups. As a byproduct of the classification, we also obtain a new characterization of one-dimensional transitive groups, offering further insights into their group structure.</description>

      <title>Set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation and regular *-semibraces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generalizations of inverse semibraces introduced by Catino, Mazzotta and Stefanelli, Miccoli has introduced regular $\star$-semibraces under the name of involution semibraces and given a sufficient condition under which the associated map to a regular $\star$-semibrace is a set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. From the viewpoint of universal algebra, regular $\star$-semibraces are (2,2,1)-type algebras. In this paper we continue to study set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation and regular $\star$-semibraces. We first consider several kinds of (2,2,1)-type algebras that induced by regular $\star$-semigroups and give some equivalent characterizations of the statement that they form regular $\star$-semibraces. Then we give sufficient and necessary conditions under which the associated maps to these (2,2,1)-type algebras are set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Finally, as analogues of weak braces defined by Catino, Mazzotta, Miccoli and Stefanelli, we introduce weak $\star$-braces in the class of regular $\star$-semibraces, describe their algebraic structures and prove that the associated maps to weak $\star$-braces are always set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. The result of the present paper shows that the class of completely regular, orthodox and locally inverse regular $\star$-semigroups is a source of possibly new set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Our results establish the close connection between the Yang-Baxter equation and the classical structural theory of regular $\star$-semigroups.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric sheaves and extraspecial groups in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine precisely which irreducible hypergeometric sheaves have an extraspecial normalizer in characteristic 2 as their geometric monodromy groups. This resolves the last open case of the determination of local monodromy at 0 of irreducible hypergeometric sheaves with finite geometric monodromy group.</description>

      <title>Formations of Finite Groups in Polynomial Time: the $\mathfrak{F}$-Radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Baer-local (composition) Fitting formation $\mathfrak{F}$ the polynomial time algorithm for the computation of the $\mathfrak{F}$-radical of a permutation group is suggested. In particular it is showed how one can compute the $\mathfrak{F}$-radical in case when $\mathfrak{F}$ is a primitive saturated formation of soluble groups. Moreover, the polynomial time algorithms for the computation of different lengthes associated with a group are presented.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Automorphism of Nonseparable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monography examines the problem of constructing a group of automorphisms of a graph. A graph automorphism is a mapping of a set of vertices onto itself that preserves adjacency. The set of such automorphisms forms a vertex group of a graph or simply a graph group. The basis for constructing a group of graph automorphisms is the concept of orbit. The construction of an orbit is closely related to the quantitative assessment of a vertex or edge of a graph, called weight. To determine the weight of an element, graph invariants built on the spectrum of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles are used. The weight of the graph elements allows identifying generating cycles and forming orbits. Examples are given of constructing a group of automorphisms for some types of graphs.</description>

      <title>The Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for irreducible representations of an infinite-dimensional general linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing a Gelfand--Tsetlin basis in irreducible representations of an infinite-dimensional general linear group. For a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a general linear group, all elements of the Gelfand--Tsetlin basis are parameterized by Gelfand--Tsetlin schemes. We extend this definition to infinite Gelfand--Tsetlin schemes, which in turn parameterize elements of the Gelfand--Tsetlin basis of an irreducible representation of an infinite-dimensional complete linear group. Using the properties of colimits of representations with the highest weight, we present an explicit form of the Gelfand--Tsetlin basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We count numbers of tame frieze patterns with entries in a finite commutative local ring. For the ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}$, $p$ a prime and $r\in\mathbb{N}$ we obtain closed formulae for all heights. These may be interpreted as formulae for the numbers of certain relations in quotients of the modular group.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Systoles and Homotopy Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of a weak variant of the homotopy type conjecture from [Gel04]. The proof relies on Belolipetskys estimate on the systole in terms of the volume which is a consequence of Prasads volume formula. In particular we extend the estimate established in [B20] for hyperbolic manifolds to general arithmetic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>Parallel Hopf-Galois structures on separable field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be a finite separable extension of fields of degree $n$, and let $E/K$ be its Galois closure. Greither and Pareigis showed how to find all Hopf-Galois structures on $L/K$. We will call a subextension $L'/K$ of $E/K$ \textit{parallel} to $L/K$ if $[L':K]=n$.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the Hopf-Galois structures on an extension $L/K$ and those on its parallel extensions. We give an example of a transitive subgroup corresponding to an extension admitting a Hopf-Galois structure but that has a parallel extension admitting no Hopf-Galois structures. We show that once one has such a situation, it can be extended into an infinite family of transitive subgroups admitting this phenomenon. We also investigate this fully in the case of extensions of degree $pq$ with $p,q$ distinct odd primes, and show that there is no example of such an extension admitting the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Key subgroups in topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two minimality properties of subgroups in topological groups. A subgroup $H$ is a key subgroup (co-key subgroup) of a topological group $G$ if there is no strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology on $G$ which induces on $H$ (resp., on the coset space $G/H$) the original topology. Every co-minimal subgroup is a key subgroup while the converse is not true. Every locally compact co-compact subgroup is a key subgroup (but not always co-minimal). Any relatively minimal subgroup is a co-key subgroup (but not vice versa). Extending some results concerning the generalized Heisenberg groups, we prove that the center ("corner" subgroup) of the upper unitriangular group $\mathrm{UT(n,K)}$, defined over a commutative topological unital ring $K$, is a key subgroup. Every "non-corner" 1-parameter subgroup $H$ of $\mathrm{UT(n,K)}$ is a co-key subgroup. We study injectivity property of the restriction map $$r_H \colon \mathcal{T}_{\downarrow}(G) \to \mathcal{T}_{\downarrow}(H), \ \sigma \mapsto \sigma|_H$$ and show that it is an isomorphism of sup-semilattices for every central co-minimal subgroup $H$, where $\mathcal{T}_{\downarrow}(G)$ is the semilattice of coarser Hausdorff group topologies on $G$.</description>
