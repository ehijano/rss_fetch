      <title>Selling Correlated Information Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do consultants price expertise? This paper studies a problem of selling information products (expertise) to a buyer (client) who faces decision-making problem under uncertainty. The client is privately informed about the type of expertise she needs and her willingness to pay (WTP) for additional information. A monopolist seller (consultant) designs and sells information products as Blackwell experiments over the underlying states associated with each client-specific desired expertise. Because there is correlation across states, a client with high WTP may find it profitable to purchase information about a low type's state, whenever correlation is sufficiently high. I find that the consultant can extract full (socially efficient) surplus whenever such (marginal) gains do not exceed the (marginal) costs of buying cheaper, but noisier information. Otherwise, unlike typical results in mechanism design, I find that buyers with low and sufficiently high value for information get no information rents, and only the "middle" types enjoy positive surplus. Common pricing structures observed in practice, like flat/hourly rates or value-based fees, are obtained as optimal contracts if correlation across states is sufficiently high or low, respectively.</description>

      <title>Random Attention Span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a random attention span model (RAS) which uses stopping time to identify decision-makers' behavior under limited attention. Unlike many limited attention models, the RAS identifies preferences using time variation without any need for menu variation. In addition, the RAS allows the consideration set to be correlated with the preference. I also use the revealed preference theory that provides testable implications for observable choice probabilities. Then, I test the model and estimate the preference distribution using data from M-Turk experiments on choice behaviors that involve lotteries; there is general alignment with the distribution results from logit attention model.</description>

      <title>Binary Mechanisms under Privacy-Preserving Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mechanism design for public-good provision under a noisy privacy-preserving transformation of individual agents' reported preferences. The setting is a standard binary model with transfers and quasi-linear utility. Agents report their preferences for the public good, which are randomly ``flipped,'' so that any individual report may be explained away as the outcome of noise. We study the tradeoffs between preserving the public decisions made in the presence of noise (noise sensitivity), pursuing efficiency, and mitigating the effect of noise on revenue.</description>

      <title>Decomposable Stochastic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate inherent stochasticity in individual choice behavior across diverse decisions. Each decision is modeled as a menu of actions with outcomes, and a stochastic choice rule assigns probabilities to actions based on the outcome profile. Outcomes can be monetary values, lotteries, or elements of an abstract outcome space. We characterize decomposable rules: those that predict independent choices across decisions not affecting each other. For monetary outcomes, such rules form the one-parametric family of multinomial logit rules. For general outcomes, there exists a universal utility function on the set of outcomes, such that choice follows multinomial logit with respect to this utility. The conclusions are robust to replacing strict decomposability with an approximate version or allowing minor dependencies on the actions' labels. Applications include choice over time, under risk, and with ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Reallocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers exchange of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and desire bundles of objects. Agents are assumed to have lexicographic preferences over bundles. We show that the generalized Top Trading Cycles rule (TTC) is characterized by Pareto efficiency, balancedness, the weak endowment lower bound, and truncation-proofness (or drop strategy-proofness). In the classic Shapley-Scarf model, TTC is characterized by Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness. The proof is nonstandard and its novelty has independent methodological interest.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of data-based price discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12723v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have enabled firms to use data to price discriminate. This paper studies third-degree price discrimination (3PD) based on a random sample of valuation and covariate data, where the covariate is continuous, and the distribution of the data is unknown to the seller. We first propose a $K$-markets empirical revenue maximization (ERM) strategy and study its rates of convergence in revenue. We then establish the fundamental information-theoretic limitation of any data-based pricing strategy and show that the $K$-markets ERM and the uniform (i.e., $1$-market) ERM strategies generate revenue converging to that of the true-distribution 3PD and uniform optima, respectively, at the optimal rate. A key takeaway from our information-theoretic limitation results is that, no sample-based 3PD strategy is able to escape from the curse of dimensionality and hence the $K$-markets ERM strategy is not an exception. This result prompts us to compare the revenues from the $K$-markets ERM and the uniform ERM in more specific cases. This comparison is ambiguous, in contrast to the classic pricing problem with a known distribution where third-degree price discrimination is at least as good as uniform pricing in generating revenue.</description>
