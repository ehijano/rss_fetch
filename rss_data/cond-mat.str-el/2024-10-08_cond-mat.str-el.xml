      <title>Electric polarization and discrete shift from boundary and corner charge in crystalline Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown how topological phases of matter with crystalline symmetry and $U(1)$ charge conservation can be partially characterized by a set of many-body invariants, the discrete shift $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ and electric polarization $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, where $\text{o}$ labels a high symmetry point. Crucially, these can be defined even with non-zero Chern number and/or magnetic field. One manifestation of these invariants is through quantized fractional contributions to the charge in the vicinity of a lattice disclination or dislocation. In this paper, we show that these invariants can also be extracted from the length and corner dependence of the total charge (mod 1) on the boundary of the system. We provide a general formula in terms of $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ and $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$ for the total charge of any subregion of the system which can include full boundaries or bulk lattice defects, unifying boundary, corner, disclination, and dislocation charge responses into a single general theory. These results hold for Chern insulators, despite their gapless chiral edge modes, and for which an unambiguous definition of an intrinsically two-dimensional electric polarization has been unclear until recently. We also discuss how our theory can fully characterize the topological response of quadrupole insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of the noncentrosymmetric magnet Sr2MnSi2O7 through irreducible representation and magnetic space group analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic structures of the noncentrosymmetric magnet Sr$_2$MnSi$_2$O$_7$ were examined through neutron diffraction for powder and single-crystalline samples, as well as magnetometry measurements. All allowed magnetic structures under the space group $P\bar{4}2_1 m$ with the magnetic wavevector $\vec{q}_{\rm m}=(0,0,1/2)$~r.l.u., were analysed via irreducible representation and magnetic space group approaches. The compound is refined to have in-plane magnetic moments within the magnetic space group $Cmc2_1.1^{\prime}_c$ (\#36.177) under zero field, which can be altered to $P2_1 2_1 2_1.1^{\prime}_c$ (\#19.28) above $\mu_0 H=0.067(5)$~T to align induced weak-ferromagnetic components within one layer on the $ab$-plane. All refined parameters are provided following the recent framework based upon the magnetic space group, which better conveys when exchanging crystallographic information for commensurate magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Topological Semimetal/Insulator States in \alpha-Type Organic Conductors with Interlayer Spin-Orbit Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the tight-binding model for the \alpha-type layered organic conductors, \alpha-(ET)2I3 and \alpha-(BETS)2I3, with a uniform interlayer coupling accompanied by spin-orbit coupling originating from the I3- anion potential. The model preserves the time reversal and inversion symmetries. In \alpha-(ET)2I3, the interlayer spin-orbit coupling realizes the experimentally suggested Dirac semimetal state. In \alpha-(BETS)2I3, however, the proposed strong topological insulator is hardly realized with inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Gapped magnetic ground state in the spin-liquid candidate $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Ag$_2$(CN)$_3$ suggested by magnetic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the magnetic ground state of highly frustrated systems remained puzzling to this day. Here, we have performed multifrequency electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on a putative quantum spin liquid compound $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Ag$_2$(CN)$_3$, which is a rare example of $S = 1/2$ spins on a triangular lattice. At high temperatures, the spin susceptibility exhibits a weak temperature dependence which can be described by the Heisenberg model with an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction of strength $J/k_B \approx 175$ K. At low temperatures, however, the rapid drop of the static spin susceptibility, together with monotonic decrease of the ESR linewidth indicates that strong singlet correlations develop below a pairing energy scale $T^*$ accompanied by a spin gap. On the other hand, a weak Curie-like spin susceptibility and the angular dependence of the linewidth suggest additional contribution from impurity spins. We propose the gradual formation of spin singlets with an inhomogeneous spin gap at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Truncated Gaussian basis approach for simulating many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions and large magnetic anisotropy in a triangle-kagome-triangle trilayer antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins in strongly frustrated systems are of intense interest due to the emergence of intriguing quantum states including superconductivity and quantum spin liquid. Herein we report the discovery of cascade of phase transitions and large magnetic anisotropy in the averievite CsClCu5P2O10 single crystals. Under zero field, CsClCu5P2O10 undergoes a first-order structural transition at around 225 K from high temperature centrosymmetric P-3m1 to low temperature noncentrosymmetric P321, followed by an AFM transition at 13.6 K, another structural transition centering at ~3 K, and another AFM transition at ~2.18 K. Based upon magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data with magnetic fields perpendicular to the ab plane, a phase diagram, consisting of a paramagnetic state, two AFM states and four field-induced states including two magnetization plateaus, has been constructed. Our findings demonstrate that the quasi-2D CsClCu5P2O10 exhibits rich structural and metamagnetic transitions and the averievite family is a fertile platform for exploring novel quantum states.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional covalent moire superlattice from fluorinating twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moire materials exhibit diverse quantum properties such as superconductivity and correlated topo logical phases, making them ideal for studying strongly correlated systems. While moire materials are typically formed by stacking two-dimensional materials with interlayer interaction dominated by weak van der Waals (vdW) forces, we explore the possibility for constructing moire covalent super lattices by fluorinating twisted bilayer graphene. With first principle calculations, we demonstrate that fluorination of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can induce covalent bonds between adjacent layers, transforming the vdW-dominated interactions. This results in enhanced modulation of the electronic structure, with abundant flat bands across the spectrum. Our findings suggest that cova lent moire superlattices offer new platforms for exploring correlated quantum phenomena and moire covalent chemistry.</description>

      <title>Observation of the spiral spin liquid in a triangular-lattice material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spiral spin liquid (SSL) is a highly degenerate state characterized by a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space spanned by a spiral propagation vector. Although the SSL state has been predicted in a number of various theoretical models, very few materials are so far experimentally identified to host such a state. Via combined single-crystal wide-angle and small-angle neutron scattering, we report observation of the SSL in the quasi-two-dimensional delafossite AgCrSe$_2$. We show that it is a very close realization of the ideal Heisenberg $J_1$--$J_2$--$J_3$ frustrated model on the triangular lattice. By supplementing our experimental results with microscopic spin-dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how such exotic magnetic states are driven by thermal fluctuations and exchange frustration.</description>

      <title>Manipulating topology of quantum phase transitions by symmetry enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology plays a cardinal role in explaining phases and quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In this study, we formulate a set of models of Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions with SU($N$)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry that have the potential to host critical points described by field theories with topological terms. For $N=2$ it shows a rich phase diagram containing semimetallic, quantum spin Hall insulating, Kekul\'e valence bond solid and s-wave superconducting phases and features multiple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phase transitions driven by interaction strength. At $N=1$ a deconfined quantum critical point is observed. At $N=2$ one expects the critical theory to correspond to a level 2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory in 2+1 dimensions. Here the numerical results however show a strong first order transition. Another transition can be governed by a topological $\theta$-term which is rendered irrelevant for even values of $N$ thus leading to Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson behaviour.</description>

      <title>Kondo Impurities at a Finite Concentration of Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the Kondo impurity problem - at a finite concentration of impurities. We identify two parameter regimes for the Kondo impurity problem. 1) The single impurity limit, where the concentration of Kondo impurities is so low that the background scattering mechanisms (non-magnetic impurities, Umklapp scattering, etc.) of the metal considered are the dominant conduction electron scattering mechanisms at zero temperature. 2) The dilute impurity system limit, where there is a resistance minimum signifying that the concentration of magnetic impurities is such that they form the dominant form of conduction electron scattering at zero temperature of the metal in question. Most theoretical efforts are currently in regime where a single isolated impurity is considered - regime 1) while most experimental efforts are in regime 2). We present analytical evidence that this explains the well known discrepancy between experiment and theory as to the value of the Kondo temperature. We find that the ratio between the two Kondo temperatures in regime 1) and regime 2) is given by: $\mathcal{R}=\exp\left[\frac{\pi^{2}\rho v_{F}}{2k_{F}^{2}Vol}\right]$ where $\rho$ is the density of states, $v_{F}$ is the fermi velocity, and $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wavevector and $Vol$ is the volume of a unit cell. We note that there is no dependence on the impurity concentration in this ratio so it is possible to define a single Kondo temperature for limit 2) for the dilute Kondo impurity system. In this work wepresent results within the Reed-Newns meanfield approximation and to leading order of the linked cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuous symmetries and quantum topology of Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems in which a continuous symmetry $G$, which may be anomalous, is spontaneously broken to an anomaly-free subgroup $H$ such that the effective action for the Goldstone modes contains topologically non-trivial terms. If the original system has trivial $G$ anomaly, it is known that the possible topological terms are fully determined by SPT or SET invariants of the residual $H$ symmetry. Here we address the more general setting in which the $G$ symmetry has an anomaly. We argue that in general, the appropriate concept to consider is the "compatibility relation" between the Goldstone invariants and the $G$ anomaly. In the case where the Goldstone modes can be gapped out to obtain invertible families (i.e. without any topological order), we give an explicit mathematical scheme to construct the desired compatibility relation. We also address the case where gapping out the Goldstone modes leads to a family of topologically ordered states. We discuss several examples including the canonical Thouless pump, the quantum Hall ferromagnet, pumps arising from breaking $\text{U}(1)$ symmetry at the boundary of topological insulators in two and three dimensions, and pumps classified by the higher Chern number.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory based investigation of heavy fermion band candidates in triplet superconductor UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compound UTe2 is of great recent interest as a spin triplet superconductor that is thought to realize a topologically nontrivial superconducting order parameter. Though UTe2 is considered to be a heavy fermion material, only light-electron Fermi surfaces have been compellingly identified, while a possible heavy electron Fermi surface near the momentum space Z-point has been the subject of more speculative and incongruent interpretations based on density functional theory (DFT+U) and experimental measurements. Here we explore the DFT+U band structure within a tight binding model framework to identify emergence mechanisms for heavy fermion Fermi surfaces. Applying a Gutzweiller-like renormalization term to f-electron kinetics is found to distort the lowest energy f electron band from a saddle point to a local minimum at the Z-point, introducing a shallow Fermi pocket and greatly improving compatibility with recent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel platform for realizing interaction-induced Hall crystals with diverse Chern numbers $C$. This platform consists of a two-dimensional semiconductor or graphene subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field and a one-dimensional modulation, which can be realized by moir\'e or dielectric engineering. We show that interactions drive the system to spontaneously break the residual translational symmetry, resulting in Hall crystals with various $C$ (including $|C|&gt;1$). Remarkably, these phases persist across continuous ranges of filling and magnetic field, and the global phase diagram can be understood in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Electronic Band Structure of Single-layer and Bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper Nickelates Probed by in-situ High Pressure X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of electronic band structure for single-layer (SL) and bilayer (BL) RP-nickelates probed by in-situ HP X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). At ambient pressure (AP), the energy splitting delta_E of d_3z^2-r^2 and d_x^2-y^2 bands are directly observed in La3Ni2O7 (BL-La327) but not in La2NiO4 (SL-La214) above E_F, underlining the critical role of inner apical O atoms. A combination of DFT-based electronic band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) calculations with simulated XANES enables us to explain the observed main XANES features labelled by a, A, B', B and C when considering the orbital hybridizations, crystal field splitting (CFS) and core-hole screening of different 3d configurations for SL-La214 and BL-La327 nickelates. At high pressure (HP), the delta_E values of pre-edge peak form a dome-like evolution above 7.7 GPa with the maximum locating at around 20 GPa for metallic BL-La327. Analysis of its integrated area and FWHM provides strong evidence that the bonding d_3z^2-r^2 band crosses E_F above about 7.7 GPa for the metallic BL-La327. Growth of integrated area of pre-edge peak and C peak further evidences pressure-induced hole doping effect. Meanwhile, the pressure dependent FWHM of pre-edge peak implies a nonmonotonic evolution of orbital-selective electronic correlation above 7.7 GPa with extrema emerging at about 20 GPa. Moreover, we estimate the relative hole doping level using the energy shift of pre-edge peak, yielding 0.074 hole per Ni site or equivalently 1.1*10^21 cm^-3 at 20 GPa for the metallic BL-La327, which is comparable to cuprates. Our results have timely examined the electronic band structures as obtained from theoretical calculations, emphasizing the essential role of both d_3z^2-r^2 and d_x^2-y^2 bands as well as the electronic correlation in superconducting pairing for pressurized La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines Schwinger-Dyson equations, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands and higher-order topology in square-octagon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive recent research on Lieb and kagome lattices highlights their unique physics characterized by the coexistence of Dirac points, van Hove singularities, and flat bands. In these models, flat bands are typically pinned at the center of the Lieb spectrum or the extrema of kagome bands, offering limited tunability. In this work, we investigate the square-octagon lattice and demonstrate that flat bands generated through next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings can be tuned with intercell hoppings or staggered magnetic fluxes. Importantly, the introduction of staggered magnetic fluxes leads to the emergence of a Chern insulator phase and a higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) state at half-filling. An appropriate magnetic flux combined with NNN hopping can generate topological flat bands in the Chern insulator phase, exhibiting nontrivial Chern number and chiral edge states. The HOTI phase, in contrast, is characterized by topological corner states with quantized quadrupole moment within the bulk and edge states gap. We also present phase diagrams for the square-octagon lattice as functions of NNN and intercell hoppings under staggered magnetic fluxes. Our results indicate that the square-octagon lattice offers a promising platform for realizing topological flat bands, HOTI, and other topological and nontopological phases.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Manipulation of Superconducting Properties via Ultrasonic Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Utilizing DC magnetization and AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in both $T_S$ and $H_{C2}$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum(L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even under extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitude, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects. Similar measurements on cuprate superconductors showed analogous behavior, suggesting a possible link between the observed modification of superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the superconducting order parameter of the organic-ion-intercalated FeSe-based superconductor (tetrabutyl ammonium)$_{0.3}$FeSe [(TBA)$_{0.3}$FeSe] using muon-spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR). Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements show only a weak temperature dependence with no evidence for magnetic ordering or broken time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density is deduced from transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements with fields applied both parallel and perpendicular to the $c$~axis axis, and can be well described by a nodeless two-gap $s+s$ wave model. These properties are reminiscent of those of (Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)OHFe$_{1-y}$Se, which also has a comparably enhanced $T_c$, suggesting that such a gap structure is a common feature of quasi-two-dimensional intercalated FeSe-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conductivity for the type-I and type-II phases of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelctric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of topological semimetals with bicircularly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of illumination of bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on topological semimetals, namely multifold fermion and line-node semimetals. We demonstrate, by means of both low-energy and lattice models, that the band-structures of both multifold fermions and line-node semimetal exhibit rich features with BCL illumination. For multifold fermions, we show that if the relative amplitude, $r$, between the two frequency components of the BCL is related to the relative frequency, $\eta$, in such a way that $r^2 = \eta$, then the band touching points remain unchanged without any shift or band gap opening for any choice of the material-dependent parameters. For other choices of the BCL parameters, we find both gapped phases as well as gapless phases with shifted band touching points. Line-node semimetals also exhibit diverse phases, ranging from protected line-nodes under illumination to point nodes, by tuning the BCL parameters $r$ and $\eta$. Overall, our analytical and numerical results establish BCL as a versatile tool for obtaining tunable topological phases.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Modular Spread Complexity for Non-Hermitian Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we generalize the concept of modular spread complexity to the cases where the reduced density matrix is non-Hermitian. This notion of complexity and associated Lanczos coefficients contain richer information than the pseudo-entropy, which turns out to be one of the first Lanczos coefficients. We also define the quantity pseudo-capacity which generalizes capacity of entanglement, and corresponds to the early modular-time measure of pseudo-modular complexity. We describe how pseudo-modular complexity can be calculated using a slightly modified bi-Lanczos algorithm. Alternatively, the (complex) Lanczos coefficients can also be obtained from the analytic expression of the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy, which can then be used to calculate the pseudo-modular spread complexity. We show some analytical calculations for 2-level systems and 4-qubit models and then do numerical investigations on the quantum phase transition of transverse field Ising model, from the (pseudo) modular spread complexity perspective. As the final example, we consider the $3d$ Chern-Simon gauge theory with Wilson loops to understand the role of topology on modular complexity. The concept of pseudo-modular complexity introduced here can be a useful tool for understanding phases and phase transitions in quantum many body systems, quantum field theories and holography.</description>

      <title>Categorical descriptions of one-dimensional gapped phases with Abelian onsite symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the macroscopic observables in the 1+1D gapped phases with Abelian onsite symmetries and show that the spacetime observables for each gapped phase form a clear structure that can be mathematically described by enriched fusion categories, which uncovers the behavior of nonlocal excitations that were blurry in traditional Landau paradigm. These categorical descriptions not only generate the known classification results for symmetry preserving and breaking phases, but also unifies lattice dualities in a broader picture. After analyzing the general lattice model together with their boundaries, we give explicit examples including nontrivial SPT phase, where nontrivial boundaries can be given directly through our classification. Using enriched categorical descriptions, the lattice dualities and their gapped phases are unified under a holographic duality between an 2d. topological order with gapped 1d boundaries and 1+1D gapped quantum liquids with a categorical symmetry, which shed light on a unified definition of all quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay of duality and stacking of bosonic and fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases in one spatial dimension. In general the classifications of bosonic and fermionic phases have different group structures under the operation of stacking, but we argue that they are often isomorphic and give an explicit isomorphism when it exists. This occurs for all unitary symmetry groups and many groups with antiunitary symmetries, which we characterize. We find that this isomorphism is typically not implemented by the Jordan-Wigner transformation, nor is it a consequence of any other duality transformation that falls within the framework of topological holography. Along the way to this conclusion, we recover the fermionic stacking rule in terms of G-pin partition functions, give a gauge-invariant characterization of the twisted group cohomology invariant, and state a procedure for stacking gapped phases in the formalism of symmetry topological field theory.</description>

Abstract: A biorthonormal-block density-matrix renormalization group algorithm is proposed to compute properties of non-Hermitian many-body systems, in which a renormalized-space partition to the non-Hermitian reduced density matrix is implemented to fulfill the prerequisite for the biorthonormality of the renormalization group (RG) transformation and to optimize the construction of saved Hilbert spaces. A redundancy in saved spaces of the reduced density matrix is exploited to reduce a condition number resulting from the non-unitarity of the left and right transformation matrices, in order to ensure the numerical stability of the RG procedure. The algorithm is successfully applied to an interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nonreciprocal hoppings and staggered complex chemical potential, exhibiting novel many-body phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work [SciPost Phys. 14, 129 (2023)] has demonstrated that quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk, by showing that the anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their non-invertibility are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals offer a unique platform for investigating robust electron-correlation effects because of their lattice geometry, flat bands and multi-orbital nature. In the cases with active flat bands, recent theoretical studies have pointed to a rich phase diagram that contains not only electronic orders but also quantum criticality. Very recently, $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$ has emerged as a strong candidate for exploring such new physics. Here, using effective tight-binding models obtained from ab initio calculations, we study the effects of electronic correlations and symmetries on the electronic structure of $\rm CsCr_3 Sb_5$. The effective tight-binding model and Fermi surface comprise multiple Cr-$d$ orbitals and Sb-$p$ orbitals. The introduction of Hubbard-Kanamori interactions leads to orbital-selective band renormalization dominated by the $d_{xz}$ band, concurrently producing emergent flat bands very close to the Fermi level. Our analysis sets the stage for further investigations into the electronic properties of $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$, including electronic orders, quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity, which promise to shed much new light into the electronic materials with frustrated lattices and bring about new connections with the correlation physics of a variety of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D SSH can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Spectrum of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>

Abstract: We investigate the low-energy effective theory of a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. We formulate the system using the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, whose saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The low-energy physics can be revealed by studying the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum around the saddle point, which is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic transport of non-Fermi liquid. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Single Crystal Diffuse Neutron Scattering Study of the Dipole-Octupole Quantum Spin Ice Candidate Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$: No Apparent Octupolar Correlations Above $T = 0.05$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The insulating magnetic pyrochlore Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ has attracted much attention as a quantum spin ice candidate with dipole-octupole character that permits spin ice phases based not only on magnetic dipole moments but also allows for even-more-exotic octupole-based spin ice phases. This work reports low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ covering the region where the magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong single crystal Bragg scattering in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent with dipolar spin ice correlations. For larger $Q$, the temperature-difference neutron diffraction shows an alternation between positive and negative net intensity. These features are qualitatively consistent with the corresponding numerical-linked-cluster (NLC) calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, or Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperatures for our measurement ($T = 0.05$ K), octupolar correlations are not present in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ on the level of our observation threshold of $\sim$ 0.1$\%$ of the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.</description>

      <title>Predicting nonequilibrium Green's function dynamics and photoemission spectra via nonlinear integral operator learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems is an important research topic in a wide range of fields across condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and high-energy physics. However, numerical studies of large-scale nonequilibrium phenomena in realistic materials face serious challenges due to intrinsic high-dimensionality of quantum many-body problems. The nonequilibrium properties of many-body systems can be described by the dynamics of the Green's function of the system, whose time evolution is given by a high-dimensional system of integro-differential equations, known as the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBEs). The time-convolution term in KBEs, which needs to be recalculated at each time step, makes it difficult to perform long-time simulations. In this paper, we develop an operator-learning framework based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address this challenge. The proposed framework utilizes RNNs to learn the nonlinear mapping between Green's functions and convolution integrals in KBEs. By using the learned operators as a surrogate model in the KBE solver, we obtain a general machine-learning scheme for predicting the dynamics of nonequilibrium Green's functions. This new methodology reduces the temporal computational complexity from $O(N_t^3)$ to $O(N_t)$, where $N_t$ is the total time steps taken in a simulation, thereby making it possible to study large many-body problems which are currently infeasible with conventional KBE solvers. Through different numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the operator-learning based approach in providing accurate predictions of physical observables such as the reduced density matrix and time-resolved photoemission spectra. Moreover, our framework exhibits clear numerical convergence and can be easily parallelized, thereby facilitating many possible further developments and applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Nonlinear Hall Effect in Three-dimensional Magnetic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) has been detected in various of condensed matter systems. Unlike linear Hall effect, NLHE may exist in physical systems with broken inversion symmetry in the crystal. On the other hand, real space spin texture may also break inversion symmetry and result in NLHE. In this letter, we employ the Feynman diagramatic technique to calculate nonlinear Hall conductivity (NLHC) in three-dimensional magnetic systems. The results connect NLHE with the physical quantity of emergent electrodynamics which oringates from the magnetic texture. The leading order contribution of NLHC $\chi_{abb}$ is proportional to the emergent toroidal moment $\mathcal{T}_{a}^{e}$ which reflects how the spin textures wind in three dimension.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states boost odd-frequency superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that the occurence of zero energy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov(YSR) bound states in two different setups, metal-spin flipper-metal-s-wave superconductor ($N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) and superconductor-metal-spin flipper-metal-superconductor ($S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) junctions, can generate multi-fold enhancement of surface-induced odd-frequency superconductivity. On the other hand, in the absence of these bound states, even-frequency superconductivity dominates. Specifically, in a $S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$ Josephson junction, the emergence of zero energy YSR bound states leads to a $0-\pi$ junction transition and surface odd-frequency superconductivity dominance. Notably, odd-frequency superconductivity vanishes in the absence of YSR-bound states. Interestingly, the equal spin-triplet pairing is the dominant component in the surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity in both setups, which could have important implications for superconducting spintronics. Overall, our findings may help to detect the presence of YSR-bound states through the observation of surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity and contribute to a better understanding of their relationship.</description>

      <title>Spin exchange-enabled quantum simulator for large-scale non-Abelian gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in the mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation for the ground state. Our result shows that -- in the trial state -- the momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i. e., the system has a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal).</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation implies symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in BF theory II: Edge-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the entanglement entropy arising from edge-modes in Abelian $p$-form topological field theories in $d$ dimensions on arbitrary spatial topology and across arbitrary entangling surfaces. We find a series of descending area laws plus universal corrections proportional to the Betti numbers of the entangling surface, which can be taken as a higher-dimensional version of the "topological entanglement entropy." Our calculation comes in two flavors: firstly, through an induced edge-mode theory appearing on the regulated entangling surface in a replica path integral and secondly through a more rigorous definition of the entanglement entropy through an extended Hilbert space. Along the way we establish several key results that are of their own merit. We explain how the edge-mode theory is a novel combination of $(p-1)$-form and $(d-p-2)$-form Maxwell theories linked by a chirality condition, in what we coin a "chiral mixed Maxwell theory." We explicitly evaluate the thermal partition function of this theory. Additionally we show that the extended Hilbert space is completely organized into representations of an infinite-dimensional, centrally extended current algebra which naturally generalizes 2d Kac-Moody algebras to arbitrary dimension and topology. We construct the Verma modules and the representation characters of this algebra. Lastly, we connect the two approaches, showing that the thermal partition function of the chiral mixed Maxwell theory is precisely an extended representation character of our current algebra, establishing an exact correspondence of the edge-mode theory and the entanglement spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooper quartets represent exotic fermion aggregates describing correlated matter at the basis of charge-$4e$ superconductivity and offer a platform for studying four-body interactions, of interest for topologically protected quantum computing, nuclear matter simulations, and more general strongly correlated matter. Focusing on solid-state systems, we show how to quantum design Cooper quartets in a double-dot system coupled to ordinary superconducting leads through the introduction of an attractive interdot interaction. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated double-dot ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum $|0\rangle$ and four-electron state $|4e\rangle$, emerges as a narrow resonance in a many-body quartet correlator that is accompanied by negligible pair correlations and features a rich phenomenology. The system represents an instance of correlated Andreev matter and the results open the way to the exploration of interaction effects in hybrid superconducting devices, and the study of novel correlated states of matter with ingredients available in a quantum solid-state laboratory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make lattice generalization of two well-known zero-dimensional models of quantum spin glass, Sachdev-Ye (SY) and spherical quantum $p$-spin glass model, to one dimension for studying crossovers in non-local scrambling dynamics due to glass transition, complex dynamics, and quantum and thermal fluctuations in paramagnetic (PM) and spin glass (SG) phases. In the SY chain of quantum dots, each described by infinite-range random Heisenberg model of $N$ spin-$S$ $SU(M)$ spins, we obtain the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_B$ as a function of temperature $T$ and the quantum parameter $S$ across the PM-SG phase boundary using a bosonic spinon representation in the large $N,M$ limit. In particular, we extract asymptotic $T$ and $S$ dependence, e.g., power laws, for $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ in different regions deep inside the phases and near the replica symmetry breaking SG transition. We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter $\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular, $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and $\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM phase of SY model. The maximum originates from enhanced chaos due to maximal complexity in the glassy landscape. Thus, the results in the SY model indicate very different evolution of glassy complexity with quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite on-site Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials. NF was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a $2\times 2$ array of gated quantum dots. Dopant arrays and gated quantum dots in Si allow for engineering controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes quantum dot arrays good candidates to study NF in different geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3\times 3$ arrays and larger $N\times N$ arrays, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3\times 3$ arrays, and in $N\times N$ arrays for one hole doping of a half-filled band. The ratio of the hopping $t$ to Hubbard on-site repulsion $U$ that defines the onset of NF scales as $1/N^{3.5}$ as $N$ increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite $U$ for large $N$. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N\times N$ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical $t/U$ for the onset of ferromagnetism scales as $N$ as the loop length increases. We show that the different dependences on size for loops and $N\times N$ arrays can be understood by scaling arguments that highlight the different energy contributions to each form of ferromagnetism. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining quantum magnetism of small systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <title>Representation-protected topology of spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-singlet $s$-wave multi-band superconductors have a topological phase protected by rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry without spin-orbit coupling in two and three dimensions. This topological phase, an example of a representation-protected topological phase, has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index and is stable as long as the bands at the Fermi energy are formed by a doublet of orbital states with finite angular momenta. In the limit of weak superconducting pair potential, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index gives a Fermi-surface formula and is related to the winding number of three-dimensional strong topological superconductors of class CI. We present a model of a topological $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductor that has gapless surface states with a quadratic dispersion and suggest a connection with iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>
