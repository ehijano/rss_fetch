      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of RG fixed point based on gradient flow in $3$D $O(N)$ sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the lattice simulation of the renormalization group flow in the $3$-dimensional $O(N)$ linear sigma model. This model possesses a nontrivial infrared fixed point, called Wilson--Fisher fixed point. Arguing that the parameter space of running coupling constants can be spanned by expectation values of operators evolved by the gradient flow, we exemplify a scaling behavior analysis based on the gradient flow in the large $N$ approximation at criticality. Then, we work out the numerical simulation of the theory with finite $N$. Depicting the renormalization group flow along the gradient flow, we confirm the existence of the Wilson--Fisher fixed point non-perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Towards the $\beta$ function of SU(2) with adjoint matter using Pauli-Villars fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of SU(2) theories with matter transforming in the adjoint representation has attracted interest from many angles. The two-flavour theory, known as Minimal Walking Technicolor, has a body of evidence pointing to it being in the conformal window with anomalous dimension $\gamma_{*}\approx0.3$. Perturbative calculations would suggest that the one-flavour theory should be confining and chirally broken; however, lattice studies of the theory have been inconclusive. In this contribution we present a first look at efforts towards the computation of the beta function of these theories using the gradient flow methodology. Following an exploration of the phase diagram of the two theories with Wilson fermions and additional Pauli-Villars fields, we tune the bare fermion mass to near the chiral limit, and subsequently generate ensembles at five lattice volumes and a range of lattice spacings.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for lattice gauge field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop diffusion models for lattice gauge theories which build on the concept of stochastic quantization. This framework is applied to $U(1)$ gauge theory in $1+1$ dimensions. We show that a model trained at one small inverse coupling can be effectively transferred to larger inverse coupling without encountering issues related to topological freezing, i.e., the model can generate configurations corresponding to different couplings by introducing the Boltzmann factors as physics conditions, while maintaining the correct physical distributions without any additional training. This demonstrates the potential of physics-conditioned diffusion models for efficient and flexible lattice gauge theory simulations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>$P$-wave charmonium contribution to hidden-charm states from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze, considering the contribution of $P$-wave charmonia, lattice data for the $D \overline{D}$-$D_s \overline{D}_s$ coupled-channel and $D \overline{D}{}^\ast$ systems and search for hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\overline{D}$-$D_s \overline{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\overline{D}$ and $D_s \overline{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states. A third pole above the $D_s \overline{D}_s$ threshold is originated from the $P$-wave $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane. The first one is related to the molecular $X(3872)$ state, with a compositeness exceeding $90\%$, while the second one, stemming from the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ charmonium, appears above the $D\overline{D}{}^\ast$ threshold and it likely corresponds to the recently discovered $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ state. In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^\ast\overline{D}{}^\ast$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>Approaching Stable Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of whether the ground state of baryon matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the ordinary nucleus or a quark matter state remains a long-standing question in physics. A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \lesssim 160$ MeV, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Dyson Summation of Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical system of approximations for summing both conventional perturbation theory and large N vector expansions of models in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. Each stage of the hierarchy consists of a closed set of nonlinear equations for one particle irreducible correlation functions with no more than K points and captures the perturbation expansion of each of those functions up to some finite order. As K goes to infinity the full Schwinger Dyson hierarchy is approached. We present an argument that for ordinary finite dimensional integrals, the procedure converges to the exact answer in this limit, despite the fact that no finite order of the hierarchy sees effects from non-leading saddle points of the integral. Some potential applications to the calculation of critical exponents, to low dimensional condensed matter systems, and to the phase structure of the homogeneous electron gas are outlined, but no detailed calculations are presented.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spectral Density in N$_f$=2+1 QCD at T=230 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized Dirac spectral density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at physical quark masses, temperature $T = 230$ MeV and system size $L_s = 3.4$ fm. To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. We also provide numerical evidence that a component of this peak, which becomes dominant in the thermodynamic limit, is due to a non-trivial accumulation of near-zero modes. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide the only complete first-principles evidence that these IR features exist and are physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 &lt; T_{\mathrm{IR}} &lt; 230\,$MeV; (iii) are consistent with non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T = 230$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Stout smearing and Wilson flow in lattice perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the expansion of stout smearing and the Wilson flow in lattice perturbation theory to order $g_0^3$, which is suitable for one-loop calculations. As the Wilson flow is generated by infinitesimal stout smearing steps, the results are related to each other by taking the appropriate limits. We show how to apply perturbative stout smearing or Wilson flow to the Feynman rules of any lattice fermion action and and illustrate them by calculating the self-energy of the clover-improved Wilson fermion.</description>

      <title>Regularization effects in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model: Strong scheme dependence of inhomogeneous phases and persistence of the moat regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the phase structure of the non-renormalizable (3+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with particular focus on inhomogeneous phases (IPs), where the chiral condensate is non-uniform in space, and the closely related moat regimes, where mesonic dispersion relations favor non-vanishing momenta. We use the mean-field approximation and consider five different regularization schemes including three lattice discretizations. The results within the different regularization schemes are systematically analyzed in order to study the dependence of the IP on the choice of regulatization scheme and regulator value. The IP exhibits a drastic dependence on the chosen regularization scheme rendering any physical interpretation of results on inhomogeneous phases in this model doubtful. In contrast, we find only a mild scheme dependence of the moat regime suggesting that its existence is a consequence of the action of the NJL model and its symmetries and, thus, that it might also exist in QCD.</description>
