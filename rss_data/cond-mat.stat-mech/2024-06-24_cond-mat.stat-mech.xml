      <title>Theory of Turbulence for $d \rightarrow \infty$: Four-Loop Approximation of the Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the renormalization group approach in the stochastic model of fully developed turbulence, the $\beta$-function has been calculated in the fourth order of perturbation theory for high-dimensional spaces $d \rightarrow \infty$. The position of the fixed point of the renormalization group in the fourth order of the $\varepsilon$-expansion has been determined, and the index $\omega$, which defines the infrared stability of this point, has been calculated. We demonstrate the possibility of significantly reducing the number of Feynman diagrams through mutual cancellation. The results obtained allow us to find the four terms of the $\varepsilon$-expansion of the index $\omega$: $$
  \omega = 2\,\varepsilon + \frac{2}{3}\,\varepsilon^2 + \frac{10}{9}\,\varepsilon^3 + \frac{56}{27}\,\varepsilon^4. $$</description>

      <title>Frustrated ferroelectricity from interlocked topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking can manifest intricate domain patterns that allow the exploration of topological defects and their potential applications, such as domain-wall nanoelectronics. Engineering actual devices remains a challenge as domain patterns have complexity-driven properties whose origin and nature are still obscure. In relaxor ferroelectrics, dominant unconventional behavior, including thermal hysteresis and dielectric dispersion, is believed to result from frustrated dynamics of mesoscopic polar nanoregions (PNRs), where competing interaction terms among multiple components allow emergent phenomena as the result of minimizing conflicts. Existing theories propose analogies with Griffiths' phases or glassy states but fail to provide a full description, making relaxors a paradigm of hereto unexplained non-ergodic phenomenology. Here, we propose an explanatory mechanism based on the competition between intrinsic mesoscopic scales that naturally arise from discrete-inversion-symmetry-breaking and topological charge-screening flux-closure constraints. Computational analysis and experimental results on domain patterns in potassium-lithium-tantalate-niobate (KTN:Li) identify the key role of spontaneous polarization vortices, dependent on the ratio between collinear and non-collinear interactions. Our findings introduce a new perspective on frustration mechanisms, demonstrating how geometrical concepts are a fundamental ingredient in emergent ferroelectric behavior. They also shed light on the physics of ferroelectric topological defects, a possible route to noise-resistant memory and processing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Universality in long-range interacting systems: the effective dimension approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensional correspondences have a long history in critical phenomena. Here, we review the effective dimension approach, which relates the scaling exponents of a critical system in $d$ spatial dimensions with power-law decaying interactions $r^{d+\sigma}$ to a local system, i.e., with finite range interactions, in an effective fractal dimension $d_\mathrm{eff}$. This method simplifies the study of long-range models by leveraging known results from their local counterparts. While the validity of this approximation beyond the mean-field level has been long debated, we demonstrate that the effective dimension approach, while approximate for non-Gaussian fixed points, accurately estimates the critical exponents of long-range models with an accuracy typically larger than $97\%$. To do so, we review perturbative RG results, extend the approximation's validity using functional RG techniques, and compare our findings with precise numerical data from conformal bootstrap for the two-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Computing Nonequilibrium Responses with Score-shifted Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using equilibrium fluctuations to understand the response of a physical system to an externally imposed perturbation is the basis for linear response theory, which is widely used to interpret experiments and shed light on microscopic dynamics. For nonequilibrium systems, perturbations cannot be interpreted simply by monitoring fluctuations in a conjugate observable -- additional dynamical information is needed. The theory of linear response around nonequilibrium steady states relies on path ensemble averaging, which makes this theory inapplicable to perturbations that affect the diffusion constant or temperature in a stochastic system. Here, we show that a separate, ``effective'' physical process can be used to describe the perturbed dynamics and that this dynamics in turn allows us to accurately calculate the response to a change in the diffusion. Interestingly, the effective dynamics contains an additional drift that is proportional to the ``score'' of the instantaneous probability density of the system -- this object has also been studied extensively in recent years in the context of denoising diffusion models in the machine learning literature. Exploiting recently developed algorithms for learning the score, we show that we can carry out nonequilibrium response calculations on systems for which the exact score cannot be obtained.</description>

      <title>Unified theory for the scaling of the crossover between strong and weak disorder behaviors of optimal paths and directed/undirected polymers in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we are concerned with the crossover between strong disorder (SD) and weak disorder (WD) behaviors in three well-known problems that involve minimal paths: directed polymers (directed paths with fixed starting point and length), optimal paths (undirected paths with fixed end-to-end/spanning distance) and undirected polymers (undirected paths with fixed starting point and length). We present a unified theoretical framework from which we can easily deduce the scaling of the crossover point of each problem. Our theory is based on the fact that the SD limit behavior of these systems is closely related to the corresponding percolation problem. As a result, the properties of those minimal paths are completely controlled by the so-called red bonds of percolation theory. Our model is first addressed numerically and then approximated by a ``two-term'' approach. This approach provides us with an analytical expression that seems to be reasonably accurate. The results are in perfect agreement with our simulations and with most of the results reported in related works. Our research also lead us to propose this crossover point as a universal measure of the disorder strength in each case. Interestingly, that measure depends on both the statistical properties of the disorder and the topological properties of the network.</description>

      <title>Effective grand-canonical description of condensation in negative-temperature regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand-canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable but their lifetime $\tau$ is exponentially long with the temperature, $\tau \approx \exp(\lambda |T|)$ (for $T&lt;0$ and $\lambda&gt;0$). More precisely, we find that condensation on a given site (i.e. emergence of a tall discrete breather) can advance only once a critical mass has been accumulated therein. This result has been obtained by combining the development of an effective grand-canonical formalism with the implementation of suitable heat baths. A general expression for $\lambda$ is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of non-interacting particles. In the DNLS model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant, makes $\lambda$ even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.</description>

      <title>Fate of entanglement in quadratic Markovian dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description for the driven-dissipative dynamics of the entanglement negativity, which quantifies the genuine entanglement in mixed-state systems. We focus on quantum quenches in fermionic and bosonic systems subject to linear dissipation, as described by quadratic Lindblad master equations. In the spirit of hydrodynamics, we divide the system into mesoscopic cells. At early times, correlations are generated in each cell by the unitary component of the evolution. Correlations are then transported across different cells via ballistic quasiparticle propagation, while simultaneously evolving under the action of the environment. We show that in the hydrodynamic limit the negativity can be reconstructed from the correlations between the independently propagating quasiparticles. We benchmark our approach considering quenches from both homogeneous and inhomogeneous initial states in the Kitaev chain, the tight-binding chain, and the harmonic chain in the presence of gain/loss dissipation.</description>

      <title>Phase distribution in 1D localization and phase transitions in single-mode waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of electrons in 1D disordered systems is usually described in the random phase approximation, when distributions of phases \varphi and \theta, entering the transfer matrix, are considered as uniform. In the general case, the random phase approximation is violated, and the evolution equations (when the system length L is increased) contain three independent variables, i.e. the Landauer resistance \rho and the combined phases \psi=\theta-\varphi and \chi=\theta+\varphi. The phase \chi does not affect the evolution of \rho and was not considered in previous papers. The distribution of the phase \psi is found to exhibit an unusual phase transition at the point E_0 when changing the electron energy E, which manifests itself in the appearance of the imaginary part of \psi. The distribution of resistance P(\rho) has no singularity at the point E_0, and the transition looks unobservable in the electron disordered systems. However, the theory of 1D localization is immediately applicable to propagation of waves in single-mode optical waveguides. The optical methods are more efficient and provide possibility to measure phases \psi and \chi. On the one hand, it makes observable the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), which can be considered as a 'trace' of the mobility edge remaining in 1D systems. On the other hand, observability of the phase \chi makes actual derivation of its evolution equation, which is presented below. Relaxation of the distribution P(\chi) to the limiting distribution P_\infty(\chi) at L\to\infty is described by two exponents, whose exponentials have jumps of the second derivative, when the energy E is changed.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition of the two-dimensional $XY$ model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition of the two-dimensional $XY$ model on the honeycomb lattice is investigated using both the techniques of Neural Network (NN) and Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated in the literature that with certain plausible assumptions, the associated critical temperature $T_{\text{BKT,H}}$ is found to be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ exactly. Surprisingly, the value of $T_{\text{BKT,H}}$ obtained from our NN calculations is 0.560(9) which deviates significantly from $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. In addition, based on the helicity modulus, the $T_{\text{BKT,H}}$ determined is 0.571(8) agreeing well with that resulting from the NN estimation. The outcomes presented in this study indicate that a detailed analytic calculation is desirable to solve the found discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The interpolation method is a powerful tool for rigorous analysis of mean-field spin glass models, both with and without dilution. In this study, we show that the interpolation method can be applied to Ising spin glass models in one dimension, such as a one-dimensional chain and a two-leg ladder. In one dimension, the replica symmetric (RS) cavity method is naturally expected to be rigorous for Ising spin glass models. Using the interpolation method, we rigorously prove that the RS cavity method provides lower bounds on the quenched free energies of Ising spin glass models in one dimension at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>An inhomogeneous adiabatic preparation of a quantum critical ground state in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.</description>

      <title>Thermal activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory, which emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled, possesses eight types of relativistic particles whose mass spectrum and scattering matrices are organized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ algebra. It is predicted that all odd-parity particles are dark and cannot be directly excited from the ground state. This makes these dark particles hard to be detected. Here, we study the local dynamical spin structure factor of the model at low-frequencies and low-temperatures. In contrast to the invisibility of the dark particles in THz spectroscopy or inelastic neutron scattering measurement, we find that the lightest dark particle is detectable, manifested as a thermal activation gap in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

Abstract: Approximated functional renormalization group (FRG) equations lead to regulator-dependent $\beta$-functions, in analogy to the scheme-dependence of the perturbative renormalization group (pRG) approach. A scheme transformation redefines the couplings to relate the $\beta$-functions of the FRG method with an arbitrary regulator function to the pRG ones obtained in a given scheme. Here, we consider a periodic sine-Gordon scalar field theory in $d=2$ dimensions and show that the relation of the FRG and pRG approaches is intricate. Although, both the FRG and the pRG methods are known to be sufficient to obtain the critical frequency $\beta_c^2 =8\pi$ of the model independently of the choice of the regulator and the renormalization scheme, we show that one has to go beyond the standard pRG method (e.g., using an auxiliary mass term) or the Coulomb-gas representation in order to obtain the $\beta$-function of the wave function renormalization. This aspect makes the scheme transformation non-trivial. Comparing flow equations of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon theory without any scheme-transformation, i.e., redefinition of couplings, we find that the auxiliary mass pRG $\beta$-functions of the minimal subtraction scheme can be recovered within the FRG approach with the choice of the power-law regulator with $b=2$, therefore constitutes a preferred choice for the comparison of FRG and pRG flows.</description>

Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly recognized for their applications in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding the thermodynamic properties of these molten salts is essential to optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), are utilized to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor was used to guide model selection process for the thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl$_3$ system and provide statistical comparisons of liquid models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable model based on the available thermochemical data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system was further optimized with uncertainty quantification using MQMQA. The thermodynamic properties of compounds in the KCl-LaCl$_3$ system were obtained from DFT-based phonon calculations. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate model is important for accurately predicting the behavior of complex molten salts.</description>

      <title>Spinodal slowing down and scaling in a holographic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of first-order phase transitions in strongly coupled systems are relevant in a variety of systems, from heavy ion collisions to the early universe. Holographic theories can be used to model these systems, with fluctuations usually suppressed. In this case the system can come close to a spinodal point where theory and experiments indicate that the the behaviour should be similar to a critical point of a second-order phase transition. We study this question using a simple holographic model and confirm that there is critical slowing down and scaling behaviour close to the spinodal point, with precise quantitative estimates. In addition, we determine the start of the scaling regime for the breakdown of quasistatic evolution when the temperature of a thermal bath is slowly decreased across the transition. We also extend the analysis to the dynamics of second-order phase transitions and strong crossovers.</description>

Abstract: We derive the low temperature thermodynamic equations corrected by virtual processes for integrable QFT on large but finite size space circle. Obtained TBA's are solved numerically for the sinh-Gordon model. We also derive corresponding Euler scale generalized hydrodynamic (GHD) equations and display them explicitly for small occupation ratio of virtual quasiparticles.

      <description>arXiv:2310.18216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a simplified description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of buckled dimers on the Si(001) surface, we consider the anisotropic 2D Ising model and study the freezing of spatial correlations during a cooling quench across the critical point. We observe a crossover from 1D to 2D behavior. For rapid cooling, we find effectively 1D behavior in the strongly coupled direction, for which we provide an exact analytic solution of the non-equilibrium dynamics. For slower cooling rates, we start to see 2D behavior where our numerical simulations show an approach to the usual Kibble-Zurek scaling in 2D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a numerical study of the ordering kinetics in the two-dimensional ($2d$) active Ising model (AIM), a discrete flocking model with a conserved density field coupled to a non-conserved magnetization field. We find that for a quench into the liquid-gas coexistence region and in the ordered liquid region, the characteristic length scale of both the density and magnetization domains follows the Lifshitz-Cahn-Allen (LCA) growth law: $R(t) \sim t^{1/2}$, consistent with the growth law of passive systems with scalar order parameter and non-conserved dynamics. The system morphology is analyzed with the two-point correlation function and its Fourier transform, the structure factor, which conforms to the well-known Porod's law, a manifestation of the coarsening of compact domains with smooth boundaries. We also find the domain growth exponent unaffected by different noise strengths and self-propulsion velocities of the active particles. However, transverse diffusion is found to play the most significant role in the growth kinetics of the AIM. We extract the same growth exponent by solving the hydrodynamic equations of the AIM.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Newton method for iterative optimization of memory kernels for generalized Langevin thermostats in coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics simulations, dynamically consistent coarse-grained (CG) models commonly use stochastic thermostats to model friction and fluctuations that are lost in a CG description. While Markovian, i.e., time-local, formulations of such thermostats allow for an accurate representation of diffusivities/long-time dynamics, a correct description of the dynamics on all time scales generally requires non-Markovian, i.e., non-time-local, thermostats. These thermostats are typically in the form of a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) determined by a memory kernel. In this work, we use a Markovian embedded formulation of a position-independent GLE thermostat acting independently on each CG degree of freedom. Extracting the memory kernel of this CG model from atomistic reference data requires several approximations. Therefore, this task is best understood as an inverse problem. While our recently proposed approximate Newton scheme, Iterative Optimization of memory kernels (IOMK), allows for the iterative optimization of a memory kernel, Markovian embedding remained potentially error-prone and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a IOMK-Gauss-Newton scheme (IOMK-GN) based on IOMK, that allows for the direct parameterization of a Markovian embedded model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient sampling and approximation of Boltzmann distributions involving large sets of binary variables, or spins, are pivotal in diverse scientific fields even beyond physics. Recent advances in generative neural networks have significantly impacted this domain. However, these neural networks are often treated as black boxes, with architectures primarily influenced by data-driven problems in computational science. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel autoregressive neural network architecture named TwoBo, specifically designed for sparse two-body interacting spin systems. We directly incorporate the Boltzmann distribution into its architecture and parameters, resulting in enhanced convergence speed, superior free energy accuracy, and reduced trainable parameters. We perform numerical experiments on disordered, frustrated systems with more than 1000 spins on grids and random graphs, and demonstrate its advantages compared to previous autoregressive and recurrent architectures. Our findings validate a physically informed approach and suggest potential extensions to multivalued variables and many-body interaction systems, paving the way for broader applications in scientific research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2002, Chowdhury et al. introduced a simplified model aimed at depicting the dynamics of single-lane unidirectional ant traffic. Despite efforts, an exact solution for the stationary state of this ant-trail model remains elusive. The primary challenge arises from inherent fluctuations in the total amount of pheromone along the ant-trail. These fluctuations significantly influence ant movement. Consequently, unlike conventional models involving driven interacting particles, the average velocity exhibits non-monotonic behavior with ant density. In this study, we propose an exactly solvable model for ant traffic whose dynamics is based on the one in Chowdhury et al.'s model, and then discuss the circumstances under which the non-monotonic trend of average velocity arises.</description>

Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates. We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how, in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies and reproduces that known perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying crystal formation is crucial. For most systems, crystallization typically goes through a nucleation process that involves dynamics that happen at short time and length scales. Due to this, molecular dynamics serves as a powerful tool to study this phenomenon. Existing approaches to study the mechanism often focus analysis on static snapshots of the global configuration, potentially overlooking subtle local fluctuations and history of the atoms involved in the formation of solid nuclei. To address this limitation, we propose a methodology that categorizes nucleation pathways into reactive pathways based on the time evolution of constituent atoms. Our approach effectively captures the diverse structural pathways explored by crystallizing Lennard-Jones-like particles and solidifying Ni$_3$Al, providing a more nuanced understanding of nucleating pathways. Moreover, our methodology enables the prediction of the resulting polymorph from each reactive trajectory. This deep learning-assisted comprehensive analysis offers an alternative view of crystal nucleation mechanisms and pathways.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigation Thresholds in Noisy Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04278v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting useful information from noisy near-term quantum simulations requires error mitigation strategies. A broad class of these strategies rely on precise characterization of the noise source. We study the robustness of probabilistic error cancellation and tensor network error mitigation when the noise is imperfectly characterized. We adapt an Imry-Ma argument to predict the existence of a threshold in the robustness of these error mitigation methods for random spatially local circuits in spatial dimensions $D \geq 2$: noise characterization disorder below the threshold rate allows for error mitigation up to times that scale with the number of qubits. For one-dimensional circuits, by contrast, mitigation fails at an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time for any imperfection in the characterization of disorder. As a result, error mitigation is only a practical method for sufficiently well-characterized noise. We discuss further implications for tests of quantum computational advantage, fault-tolerant probes of measurement-induced phase transitions, and quantum algorithms in near-term devices.</description>

Abstract: Universality is a crucial concept in modern physics, allowing us to capture the essential features of a system's behavior using a small set of parameters. In this work, we unveil universal spin relaxation dynamics in anisotropic random Heisenberg models with infinite-range interactions at high temperatures. Starting from a polarized state, the total magnetization can relax monotonically or decay with long-lived oscillations, determined by the sign of a universal single function $A=-\xi_1^2+\xi_2^2-4\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_3^2$. Here $(\xi_1,\xi_3,\xi_3)$ characterizes the anisotropy of the Heisenberg interaction. Furthermore, the oscillation shows up only for $A&gt;0$, with frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{A}$. To validate our theory, we compare it to numerical simulations by solving the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equation with a melon diagram approximation and the exact diagonalization (ED). The results show our theoretical prediction works in both cases, regardless of a small system size $N=8$ in ED simulations. Our study sheds light on the universal aspect of quantum many-body dynamics beyond low energy limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A good theory of mathematical beauty is more practical than any current observation, as new predictions of physical reality can be verified self-consistently. This belief applies to the current status of understanding deep neural networks including large language models and even the biological intelligence. Toy models provide a metaphor of physical reality, allowing mathematically formulating that reality (i.e., the so-called theory), which can be updated as more conjectures are justified or refuted. One does not need to pack all details into a model, but rather, more abstract models are constructed, as complex systems like brains or deep networks have many sloppy dimensions but much less stiff dimensions that strongly impact macroscopic observables. This kind of bottom-up mechanistic modeling is still promising in the modern era of understanding the natural or artificial intelligence. Here, we shed light on eight challenges in developing theory of intelligence following this theoretical paradigm. Theses challenges are representation learning, generalization, adversarial robustness, continual learning, causal learning, internal model of the brain, next-token prediction, and finally the mechanics of subjective experience.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of energy transport in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ matrix product state simulations to study energy transport within the non-integrable regime of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model. To induce a non-equilibrium steady state throughout the system, we consider open system dynamics with boundary driving featuring jump operators with adjustable temperature and footprint in the system. Given a steady state, we diagnose the effective local temperature by minimizing the trace distance between the true local state and the local state of a uniform thermal ensemble. Via a scaling analysis, we extract the transport coefficients of the model at relatively high temperatures above both its gapless and gapped low-temperature phases. In the medium-to-high temperature regime we consider, diffusive transport is observed regardless of the low-temperature physics. We calculate the temperature dependence of the energy diffusion constant as a function of model parameters, including in the regime where the model is quantum critical at the low temperature. Notably, even within the gapless regime, an analysis based on power series expansion implies that intermediate-temperature transport can be accessed within a relatively confined setup. Although we are not yet able to reach temperatures where quantum critical scaling would be observed, our approach is able to access the transport properties of the model over a broad range of temperatures and parameters. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our method and potential extensions that could expand its scope, for example, to even lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian character and irreversibility of real-time quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of pairing correlations within the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) extension to superfluid systems, is tantamount to the presence of a quantum collision integral in the evolution equations, which leads to an obviously non-Markovian behavior of the single-particle occupation probabilities, unexpected in a traditional quantum extension of kinetic equations. The quantum generalization of the Boltzmann equation, based on a collision integral in terms of phase-space occupation probabilities, is the most used approach to describe nuclear dynamics and which by construction has a Markovian character. By contrast, the extension of TDDFT to superfluid systems has similarities with the Baym and Kadanoff kinetic formalism, which however is formulated with much more complicated evolution equations with long-time memory terms and non-local interactions. The irreversibility of quantum dynamics is properly characterized using the canonical wave functions/natural orbitals, and the associated canonical occupation probabilities, which provide the smallest possible representation of any fermionic many-body wave function. In this basis, one can evaluate the orbital entanglement entropy, which is an excellent measure of the non-equilibrium dynamics of an isolated system. To explore the phenomena of memory effects and irreversibility, we investigate the use of canonical wave functions/natural orbitals in nuclear many-body calculations, assessing their utility for static calculations, dynamics, and symmetry restoration. As the number of single-particle states is generally quite large, it is highly desirable to work in the canonical basis whenever possible, preferably with a cutoff. We show that truncating the number of canonical wave functions can be a valid approach in the case of static calculations, but that such a truncation is not valid for time-dependent calculations...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy properties of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain with time-reversal symmetry-breaking pseudo-scalar chiral interaction and propose a phase diagram for the model. In the integrable case of the isotropic Heisenberg model with the chiral interaction, we employ the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to find "chiralization", the response of the ground state versus the strength of the pseudo-scalar chiral interaction of a chiral Heisenberg chain. Unlike the magnetization case, the chirality of the ground state remains zero until the transition point corresponding to critical coupling $\alpha_c=2J/\pi$ with $J$ being the antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The central-charge $c=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) describe the two phases with zero and finite chirality. We show for this particular case and conjecture more generally for similar phase transitions that the difference between two emergent CFTs with identical central charges lies in the symmetry of their ground state (lightest weight) primary fields, i.e., the two phases are symmetry-enriched CFTs. At finite but small temperatures, the non-chiral Heisenberg phase acquires a finite chirality that scales with the temperature quadratically. We show that the finite-size effect around the transition point probes the transition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Representation of Gaussian Fermionic Pure States in Non-Computational Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for representing Gaussian fermionic states, pivotal in quantum spin systems and fermionic models, within a range of alternative quantum bases. We focus on transitioning these states from the conventional computational (\sigma^z) basis to more complex bases, such as ((\phi, \frac{\pi}{2}, \alpha)), which are essential for accurately calculating critical quantities like formation probabilities and Shannon entropy. We present a novel algorithm that not only simplifies the basis transformation but also reduces computational complexity, making it feasible to calculate amplitudes of large systems efficiently. Our key contribution is a technique that translates amplitude calculations into the Pfaffian computation of submatrices from an antisymmetric matrix, a process facilitated by understanding domain wall relationships across different bases. As an application, we will determine the formation probabilities for various bases and configurations within the critical transverse field Ising chain, considering both periodic and open boundary conditions. We aim to categorize the configurations and bases by examining the universal constant term that characterizes the scaling of the logarithm of the formation probability in the periodic system, as well as the coefficient of the logarithmic term in the case of open systems. In the open system scenario, this coefficient is influenced by the central charge and the conformal weight of the boundary condition-changing operator. This work is set to expand the toolkit available for researchers in quantum information theory and many-body physics, providing a more efficient and elegant solution for exploring Gaussian fermionic states in non-standard quantum bases.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for the electrical conductance of random resistor networks which mimic crack-template-based transparent conductive films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied random resistor networks produced with regular structure and random distribution of edge conductances. These networks are intended to mimic crack-template-based transparent conductive films as well some random networks produced using nano-imprinting technology. Applying an effective medium theory, we found out that the electrical conductance of such networks is $\approx 0.5852 \sqrt{n_E}$, where $n_E$ is the number density of conductive edges. This dependence is in agreement with numerical calculations in Voronoi networks, although the effective conductances are approximately 15\% larger.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Neural density functionals: Local learning and pair-correlation matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Dijkman et al. (arXiv:2403.15007) proposed training classical neural density functionals via bulk pair-correlation matching. We show their method to be an efficient regularizer for neural functionals based on local learning of inhomogeneous one-body direct correlations [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120 (2023), doi:10.1073/pnas.2312484120]. While Dijkman et al. demonstrated pair-correlation matching of a global neural free energy functional, we argue in favor of local one-body learning for flexible neural modelling of the full Mermin-Evans density functional map. Using spatial localization gives access to accurate neural free energy functionals, including convolutional neural networks, that transcend the training box.</description>
