      <title>True mass and atmospheric composition of the non-transiting hot Jupiter HD 143105 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Keck/KPIC phase II $K$-band observations of the non-transiting hot Jupiter HD 143105 b. Using a cross-correlation approach, we make the first detection of the planetary atmosphere at $K_p = 185^{+11}_{-13}\rm km\ s^{-1}$ and an inferior conjunction time 2.5 hours before the previously-published ephemeris. The retrieved $K_p$ value, in combination with orbital period, mass of the host star, and lack of transit detection, gives an orbital inclination of $78^{\circ+2}_{-12}$ and a true planet mass of 1.23$\pm0.10\rm\ M_J$. While the equilibrium temperature of HD 143105 b is in the transition regime between non-inverted and inverted atmospheres, our analysis strongly prefers a non-inverted atmosphere. Retrieval analysis indicates the atmosphere of HD 143105 b is cloud-free to approximately 1 bar and dominated by H$_2$O absorption ($\log \rm H_2O_{MMR} = -3.9^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$), placing only an upper limit on the CO abundance ($\log \rm CO_{MMR} &lt; -3.7$ at 95% confidence). We place no constraints on the abundances of Fe, Mg, or $^{13}$CO. From these abundances, we place an upper limit on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio for HD 143105 b, $\rm C/O &lt; 0.2$ at 95% confidence, and find the atmospheric metallicity is approximately $0.1\times$ solar. The low metallicity may be responsible for the lack of a thermal inversion, which at the temperature of HD 143105 b would likely require significant opacity from TiO and/or VO. With these results, HD 143105 b joins the small number of non-transiting hot Jupiters with detected atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach for mapping the stable orbits around planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical N-body simulations are commonly used to explore stability regions around exoplanets, offering insights into the possible existence of satellites and ring systems. This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) techniques to generate predictive maps of stable regions surrounding a hypothetical planet. The approach can also be extended to planet-satellite systems, planetary ring systems, and other similar configurations. A dataset was generated using 10^5 numerical simulations, each incorporating nine orbital features for the planet and a test particle in a star-planet-test particle system. The simulations were classified as stable or unstable based on stability criteria, requiring particles to remain stable over a timespan equivalent to 10,000 orbital periods of the planet. Various ML algorithms were tested and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to determine the most effective predictive model. Tree-based algorithms showed comparable accuracy in performance. The best-performing model, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 98.48%, with 94% recall and precision for stable particles and 99% for unstable particles. ML algorithms significantly reduce the computational time required for three-body simulations, operating approximately 100,000 times faster than traditional numerical methods. Predictive models can generate entire stability maps in less than a second, compared to the days required by numerical simulations. The results from the trained ML models will be made accessible through a public web interface, enabling broader scientific applications.</description>

      <title>A substellar flyby that shaped the orbits of the giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modestly eccentric and non-coplanar orbits of the giant planets pose a challenge to solar system formation theories which generally indicate that the giant planets emerged from the protoplanetary disk in nearly perfectly circular and coplanar orbits. We demonstrate that a single encounter with a 2-50 Jupiter-mass object, passing through the solar system at a perihelion distance less than 20 AU and a hyperbolic excess velocity less than 6 km/s, can excite the giant planets' eccentricities and mutual inclinations to values comparable to those observed. We estimate that there is about a 1-in-100 chance that such a flyby produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system. We describe a metric to evaluate how closely a simulated system matches the eccentricity and inclination secular modes of the solar system. The scenario of a close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular architecture of the planets.</description>

      <title>Chondrites as thermal and mechanical archives of accretion processes in the Solar protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As some of the most ancient materials in our Solar System, chondritic meteorites offer a valuable window into the early stages of planetary formation, particularly the accretion processes that built the most primitive asteroids. Until now, high energy shocks and collisions have been invoked to explain the deformation and fragmentation of chondrules, the main component of chondrites. However, simulating the cooling of chondrules using continuum mechanics and finite elements, we demonstrate that plastic deformation of chondrules can occur at low collision velocities of just a few meters per second and with kinetic energies less than tenths of a millijoule when temperatures exceed the glass transition temperature Tg ~ 1000 K. Conversely, below Tg, spontaneous chondrule cracking occurs due to differential thermal contraction between phases and is more pronounced in larger chondrules. Counterintuitively, our findings suggest that both ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites formed through similar low-energy processes, with varying degrees of ductility and brittleness depending on the amount of processed material. This implies that the environments where chondrites formed were likely less turbulent and more thermally active than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Water Enrichment from Pebble Drift in Disks with Gap-forming Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatiles like $H_2O$ are present as ice in solids in the outer cold regions of protoplanetary disks and as vapor in the warm inner regions within the water snow line. Icy pebbles drifting inwards from the outer disk sublimate after crossing the snow line, enriching the inner disk with solid mass and water vapor. Meanwhile, proto-planets forming within the disk open gaps in the disk gas, creating traps against the inward drift of pebbles and in turn reducing water enrichment in the inner disk. Recent disk observations from millimeter interferometry and infrared spectroscopy have supported this broad picture by finding a correlation between the outer radial distribution of pebbles and the properties of inner water vapor spectra. In this work, we aim at further informing previous and future observations by building on previous models to explore pebble drift in disks with multiple gaps. We systematically explore multiple gap locations and their depths (equivalent to specific masses of planets forming within), and different particle sizes to study their impact on inner disk water enrichment. We find that the presence of close-in deep gaps carved by a Jupiter-mass planet is likely crucial for blocking icy pebble delivery into the inner disk, while planets with lower masses only provide leaky traps. We also find that disks with multiple gaps show lower vapor enrichment in the inner disk. Altogether, these model results support the idea that inner disk water delivery and planet formation are regulated by the mass and location of the most massive planets.</description>

      <title>Eta-Earth Revisited II: Deriving a Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Lammer et al. 2024, we defined Earth-like Habitats (EH) as rocky planets in the habitable zone of complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$ can exist and derived a formula for estimating their maximum number in the Galaxy. Here, we apply this formula by considering only requirements that are already scientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate, initial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial distribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply models for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres with various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution and upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet frequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential large moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these criteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet scientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve. We find that EHs are rare by obtaining maximum numbers of $2.5^{+71.6}_{-2.4}\times10^{5}$ and $0.6^{+27.1}_{-0.59}\times10^{5}$ planets that can potentially host N$_2$-Earth-like atmospheres with maximum CO$_2$ mixing ratios of 10\% and 1\%, respectively, implying that a minimum of $\sim 10^3 - 10^6$ rocky HZCL planets are needed for 1 EH to evolve. Their actual number, however, may be substantially lower as several requirements are not included in our model; this also implies ETIs are significantly rarer still. Our results illustrate that neither every star can host EHs, nor that each rocky HZCL planet evolves such that it may be able to host complex animal-like life. The Copernican Principle therefore cannot be applied to infer that such life is common in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Eta-Earth Revisited I: A Formula for Estimating the Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this hypothesis article, we discuss the basic requirements of planetary environments where aerobe organisms can grow and survive, including atmospheric limitations of millimeter-to-meter-sized biological animal life based on physical limits, and O$_2$, N$_2$, and CO$_2$ toxicity levels. By assuming that animal-like extraterrestrial organisms adhere to similar limits, we define Earth-like Habitats ($\eta_{\rm EH}$) as rocky exoplanets in the Habitable Zone of Complex Life that host N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$, at which advanced animal-like life can in principle evolve and exist. We then derive a new formula that can be used to estimate the maximum occurrence rate of such Earth-like Habitats in the Galaxy. This contains realistic probabilistic arguments that can be fine-tuned and constrained by atmospheric characterization with future space and ground-based telescopes. As an example, we briefly discuss two specific requirements feeding into our new formula that, although not quantifiable at present, will become scientifically quantifiable in the upcoming decades due to future observations of exoplanets and their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The effect of radiation pressure on the dispersal of photoevaporating discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed IR excesses indicate that protoplanetary discs evolve slowly for the majority of their lifetime before losing their near- and mid-IR excesses on short timescales. Photoevaporation models can explain this "two-timescale" nature of disc evolution through the removal of inner regions of discs after a few million years. However, they also predict the existence of a population of non-accreting discs with large cavities. Such discs are scarce within the observed population, suggesting the models are incomplete. We explore whether radiation-pressure-driven outflows are able to remove enough dust to fit observations. We simulate these outflows using cuDisc, including dust dynamics, growth/fragmentation, radiative transfer and a parameterisation of internal photoevaporation. We find that, in most cases, dust mass-loss rates are around 5-10 times too small to meet observational constraints. Particles are launched from the disc inner rim, however grains larger than around a micron do not escape in the outflow, meaning mass-loss rates are too low for the initial dust masses at gap-opening. Only systems that have smooth photoevaporation profiles with gas mass-loss rates $&gt;\sim 5 \times 10^{-9}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and disc dust masses $&lt;\sim$1 $M_\oplus$ at the time of gap opening can meet observational constraints; in the current models these manifest as EUV winds driven by atypically large high-energy photon fluxes. We also find that the height of the disc's photosphere is controlled by small grains in the outflow as opposed to shadowing from a hot inner rim; the effect of this can be seen in synthetic scattered light observations.</description>

      <title>C/O ratios in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs with dust evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Novel Physics of Escaping Secondary Atmospheres May Shape the Cosmic Shoreline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS-1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</description>

      <title>Using the helium triplet as a tracer of the physics of giant planet outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic outflows, such as those observed escaping close-in gas giant planets, are not isothermal in structure. Their highly ionized nature allows them to cool adiabatically at distances beyond several planetary radii. The contrast between the hottest gas temperatures at around 10,000K and the coldest at around 1,000K triggers an excess population of the observable helium triplet. This excess is caused by the suppression of collisional de-excitation from the triplet state at cool temperatures. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we show that this helium triplet excess may explain the excess broadening seen in HD 189733b's observed transmission spectrum, demonstrating adiabatic cooling of its outflow, confirming its hydrodynamic nature on scales of several planetary radii. However, further observations are required to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, we explore a range of electron transitions for neutral helium which were not considered in the previous literature. We find that the He$2^1$S state is unavailable as a potential reservoir for He$2^3$S electrons. Additionally, the de-excitation to the ground state must be considered for stellar spectra later than K2 in predicting the correct helium triplet population. Importantly, since triplet helium inherits momentum from ionized helium as it is generated by recombination, it is significantly less prone to fractionation than ground-state neutral helium. However at separations of $\gtrsim 0.05$~au, ionization at the flow base and drag on helium weaken, leading to significant fractionation of the then mostly neutral helium. This in turn, can cause a suppression of the Helium transit depth, even though the helium line width remains large.</description>

      <title>New Ultracool Companions to Nearby White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a search for new ultracool companions to nearby white dwarfs using multiple methods, including the analysis of colors and examination of images in both the optical and the infrared. Through this process, we identified fifty-one previously unrecognized systems with candidate ultracool companions. Thirty-one of these systems are resolved in at least one catalog, and all but six are confirmed as co-moving companions via common proper motion and consistent parallax measurements (when available). We have followed up four co-moving companions with near-infrared spectroscopy and confirm their ultracool nature. The remaining twenty candidates are unresolved, but show clear signs of infrared excess which is most likely due to the presence of a cold, low-mass companion or a dusty circumstellar disk. Three of these unresolved systems have existing optical spectra that clearly show the presence of a cool stellar companion to the white dwarf primary via spectral decomposition. These new discoveries, along with our age estimates for the primary white dwarfs, will serve as valuable benchmark systems for future characterization of ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>SDSS J100711.74+193056.2: A Candidate Common Motion Substellar Companion to the Nearest B-Type Star Regulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The L9 dwarf SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is situated 7$^{\circ}$.5 north of the nearest B-type star Regulus (d = 24.3+-0.2 pc), part of a stellar quadruplet. The object is at similar distance (d = 21.9+-1.0 pc) as Regulus, with a 3D separation of 3.9+0.6-0.5 pc ($\sim$1.6 tidal radii from Regulus), and shares tangential motion within 2 km/s, hinting at a physical connection. Near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES finds that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 also has a comparable radial velocity as Regulus A and B, a metallicity similar to Regulus B, and a spectral morphology consistent with the estimated 1--2 Gyr total age of Regulus's close pre-white dwarf companion. Taken together, these observations indicate that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is a very widely-separated and potentially physically-bound companion to Regulus, with a binding energy and mass ratio comparable to other wide star-brown dwarf systems. It joins a growing list of brown dwarfs at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition with independent constraints on physical properties such as age and metallicity.</description>

      <title>Uniform characterisation of an ensemble of main-sequence benchmark stars: effect of Gaia-based data on grid search models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of stellar parameters (such as radius and mass) through asteroseismic forward modelling depends on the number, accuracy, and precision of seismic and atmospheric constraints. ESA's Gaia space mission is providing precise parallaxes which yield an additional constraint to be included in the model grid search. Using a handful of main-sequence benchmark stars, we perform a uniform characterisation of these stars. We assess the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters inferred from grid-based searches when a Gaia-based luminosity is combined with different stellar constraints. We also examine the precision needed for an interferometric radius (model-independent radius) to have a significant contribution towards the determination of stellar mass in the optimisation process. Our findings show that more precise stellar masses are inferred for some stars when seismic and spectroscopic constraints are complemented with a Gaia-based luminosity, with a scatter varying from 1.9 per cent to 0.8 per cent. However, the inferred stellar radii are underestimated when compared to the interferometric radii and yield a scatter of $\sim$1.9 per cent. In addition, we demonstrate that a precisely measured interferometric radius ($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) when applied in the optimisation process yields a mass with a precision $\lesssim$ 1.5 per cent. Finally, we find that when only $l=0$ mode oscillation frequencies are available, robust masses and radii are still attainable. However, this requires precise and numerous $l=0$ mode oscillations frequencies ($&gt;$ 8) to be coupled with atmospheric constraints.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Saturn: A Post-Cassini Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Saturn System has been studied in detail by the Cassini-Huygens Mission. A major thrust of those investigations has been to understand how Saturn formed and evolved and to place Saturn in the context of other gas giants and planetary systems in general. Two models have been proposed for the formation of the giant planets,the core accretion model and the disk instability model. The heavy element enrichment, core size, and internal structure of Saturn, compared to Jupiter strongly favor the core accretion model as for Jupiter. Two features of the core accretion model that are distinct from the disk instability model are the growth of a core with a mass several times that of the Earth, followed by runaway collapse of gas onto the core once a mass threshold is reached. The heavy element core grows slowly over millions of years through accretion of cm-m sized pebbles, even larger bodies, and moon sized embryos in the gaseous disk. The abundance pattern of heavy elements is thus a key constraint on formation models. C, N, S, and P at Saturn are presently known to varying degree of uncertainty. The He to H ratio in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding heat balance, interior processes, and planetary evolution, but present values at Saturn range from low to high, allowing for a wide range of possibilities. While the very low values are favored to explain excess luminosity, high values might indicate presence of layered convection in the interior, resulting in slow cooling. Additional insight into Saturn's formation comes from the unique data on the rings from Cassini's Grand Finale orbits. While the solar system is the only analog for the extra solar systems, detection of the alkali metals and water in giant exoplanets is useful for understanding the formation and evolution of Saturn, where such data are presently lacking.</description>

      <title>Predicting Interstellar Object Chemodynamics with Gaia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar object population of the Milky Way is a product of its stars. However, what is in fact a complex structure in the Solar neighbourhood has traditionally in ISO studies been described as smoothly distributed. Using a debiased stellar population derived from the Gaia DR3 stellar sample, we predict that the velocity distribution of ISOs is far more textured than a smooth Gaussian. The moving groups caused by Galactic resonances dominate the distribution. 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have entirely normal places within these distributions; 1I is within the non-coeval moving group that includes the Matariki (Pleiades) cluster, and 2I within the Coma Berenices moving group. We show that for the composition of planetesimals formed beyond the ice line, these velocity structures also have a chemodynamic component. This variation will be visible on the sky. We predict that this richly textured distribution will be differentiable from smooth Gaussians in samples that are within the expected discovery capacity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Solar neighbourhood ISOs will be of all ages and come from a dynamic mix of many different populations of stars, reflecting their origins from all around the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: TOI-5688 A b, a low-density giant orbiting a high-metallicity early M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a low-density planet orbiting the high-metallicity early M-dwarf TOI-5688 A b. This planet was characterized as part of the search for transiting giant planets ($R \gtrsim8$ M${}_\oplus$) through the Searching for GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) survey. The planet was discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and characterized with ground-based transits from Red Buttes Observatory (RBO), the Table Mountain Observatory of Pomona College, and radial velocity (RV) measurements with the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF) on the 10 m Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET) and NEID on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. From the joint fit of transit and RV data, we measure a planetary mass and radius of $124\pm24$ M$_\oplus$ ($0.39\pm0.07$ M${}_J$) and $10.4\pm0.7$ R$_\oplus$ ($0.92\pm0.06$ R${}_J$) respectively. The spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the host star TOI-5688 A shows that it is a metal-rich ([Fe/H] $ = 0.47\pm0.16$ dex) M2V star, favoring the core-accretion formation pathway as the likely formation scenario for this planet. Additionally, Gaia astrometry suggests the presence of a wide-separation binary companion, TOI-5688 B, which has a projected separation of $\sim5"$ (1110 AU) and is an M4V, making TOI-5688 A b part of the growing number of GEMS in wide-separation binary systems.</description>

      <title>Water in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI: spectral excitation atlas and radial distribution from temperature diagnostic diagrams and Doppler mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims at providing fundamental general tools for the analysis of water spectra as observed in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI. We analyze 25 high-quality spectra from the JDISC Survey reduced with asteroid calibrators as presented in Pontoppidan et al. (2024). First, we present a spectral atlas to illustrate the clustering of H$_2$O transitions from different upper level energies ($E_u$) and identify single (un-blended) transitions that provide the most reliable measurements. With that, we demonstrate two important excitation effects: the opacity saturation of ortho-para line pairs that overlap, and the non-LTE excitation of $v=1-1$ lines scattered across the $v=0-0$ rotational band. Second, we define a shorter list of fundamental lines spanning $E_u=$ 1500-6000 K to develop simple line-ratio diagnostic diagrams for the radial temperature distribution of water in inner disks, which can be interpreted using discrete temperature components or a radial gradient. Third, we report the detection of disk-rotation Doppler broadening of molecular lines, which confirms the radial distribution of water emission including, for the first time, the radially-extended $\approx$ 170-220 K reservoir close to the snowline. The combination of measured line ratios and broadening suggests that drift-dominated disks have shallower temperature gradients with an extended cooler disk surface enriched by ice sublimation. We also report the first detection of a H$_2$O-rich inner disk wind from narrow blue-shifted absorption in the ro-vibrational lines. We summarize these findings and tools into a general recipe to make the study of water in planet-forming regions reliable, effective, and sustainable for samples of $&gt; 100$ disks.</description>

      <title>History and Habitability of the LP 890-9 Planetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerous aspects of the evolution of the LP 890-9 (SPECULOOS-2/TOI-4306) planetary system, focusing on the likelihood that planet c can support life. We find that the host star reaches the main sequence in 1 Gyr and that planet c lies close to the inner boundary of the habitable zone. We find the magma ocean stage can last up to 50 Myr, remove 8 Earth-oceans of water, and leave up to 2000 bars of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, if the planet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water will be lost during the star's pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape processes. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion resonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal dissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of mantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c's orbit may require more than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach hundreds of terawatts. We thus conclude that the habitability of planet c depends most strongly on the initial volatile content and internal properties, but no data yet preclude the viability of an active biosphere on the planet.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG LXVI. A homogeneous search for Na i and its possible variability in ten gas giant exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutral sodium resonance doublet (Na i D) has been detected in the upper atmosphere of several close-in gas giants, through high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to investigate whether its variability is linked to the planets' properties, the data quality, or the accuracy of the system parameters used.
  Using the public code SLOPpy, we extracted the transmission spectrum in the Na i D region of ten gas giants for which a large number of HARPS-N observations are available. We modelled the absorption signals found, performing an MCMC analysis, and converted the measured absorption depth to the corresponding atmospheric height over which most sodium absorption occurs.
  While two targets (GJ 436 b and KELT-7 b) show no Na i D feature, we found variability in the transmission spectrum of the other targets. Three of them (HD 209458 b, WASP-80 b, and WASP-127 b) present absorption on only some nights, while in the other five targets (HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b), a significant absorption signal is present on most of the nights analysed. Except for WASP-69 b, the measured absorption depths lead to a ratio of the two Na I D depths that is compatible with or slightly larger than one.
  As was expected from literature, the relative atmospheric height follows an empirical exponential trend as a function of a scaled product of the planet's equilibrium temperature and surface gravity.
  We confirm the sodium detection on HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b. The signal detected in WASP-127 b requires further observations for definitive confirmation. We exclude a planetary origin for the signals found on HD 209458 b and WASP-80 b. The sodium absorption variability does not appear to be related to planetary properties, but rather to data quality, sub-optimal data treatment, or stellar activity.</description>

      <title>From Misaligned Sub-Saturns to Aligned Brown Dwarfs: The Highest $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ Systems Exhibit Low Obliquities, Even around Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&gt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&lt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.</description>
