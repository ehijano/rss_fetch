      <title>Data time travel and consistent market making: taming reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems with anonymous data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning works best when the impact of the agent's actions on its environment can be perfectly simulated or fully appraised from available data. Some systems are however both hard to simulate and very sensitive to small perturbations. An additional difficulty arises when an RL agent must learn to be part of a multi-agent system using only anonymous data, which makes it impossible to infer the state of each agent, thus to use data directly. Typical examples are competitive systems without agent-resolved data such as financial markets. We introduce consistent data time travel for offline RL as a remedy for these problems: instead of using historical data in a sequential way, we argue that one needs to perform time travel in historical data, i.e., to adjust the time index so that both the past state and the influence of the RL agent's action on the state coincide with real data. This both alleviates the need to resort to imperfect models and consistently accounts for both the immediate and long-term reactions of the system when using anonymous historical data. We apply this idea to market making in limit order books, a notoriously difficult task for RL; it turns out that the gain of the agent is significantly higher with data time travel than with naive sequential data, which suggests that the difficulty of this task for RL may have been overestimated.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Relative Valuation of Municipal Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trading ecosystem of the Municipal (muni) bond is complex and unique. With nearly 2\% of securities from over a million securities outstanding trading daily, determining the value or relative value of a bond among its peers is challenging. Traditionally, relative value calculation has been done using rule-based or heuristics-driven approaches, which may introduce human biases and often fail to account for complex relationships between the bond characteristics. We propose a data-driven model to develop a supervised similarity framework for the muni bond market based on CatBoost algorithm. This algorithm learns from a large-scale dataset to identify bonds that are similar to each other based on their risk profiles. This allows us to evaluate the price of a muni bond relative to a cohort of bonds with a similar risk profile. We propose and deploy a back-testing methodology to compare various benchmarks and the proposed methods and show that the similarity-based method outperforms both rule-based and heuristic-based methods.</description>

      <title>Quantile Regression using Random Forest Proximities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of financial markets, maintaining models that produce precise predictions over time is difficult. Often the goal isn't just point prediction but determining uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty, especially the aleatoric uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of market drivers, helps investors understand varying risk levels. Recently, quantile regression forests (QRF) have emerged as a promising solution: Unlike most basic quantile regression methods that need separate models for each quantile, quantile regression forests estimate the entire conditional distribution of the target variable with a single model, while retaining all the salient features of a typical random forest. We introduce a novel approach to compute quantile regressions from random forests that leverages the proximity (i.e., distance metric) learned by the model and infers the conditional distribution of the target variable. We evaluate the proposed methodology using publicly available datasets and then apply it towards the problem of forecasting the average daily volume of corporate bonds. We show that using quantile regression using Random Forest proximities demonstrates superior performance in approximating conditional target distributions and prediction intervals to the original version of QRF. We also demonstrate that the proposed framework is significantly more computationally efficient than traditional approaches to quantile regressions.</description>

      <title>CLVR Ordering of Transactions on AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trading on decentralized exchanges via an Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism has been massively adopted, with a daily trading volume reaching $1B. This trading method has also received close attention from researchers, central banks, and financial firms, who have the potential to adopt it to traditional financial markets such as foreign exchanges and stock markets. A critical challenge of AMM-powered trading is that transaction order has high financial value, so a policy or method to order transactions in a "good" (optimal) manner is vital. We offer economic measures of both price stability (low volatility) and inequality that inform how a "social planner" should pick an optimal ordering. We show that there is a trade-off between achieving price stability and reducing inequality, and that policymakers must choose which to prioritize. In addition, picking the optimal order can often be costly, especially when performing an exhaustive search over trade orderings (permutations). As an alternative we provide a simple algorithm, Clever Look-ahead Volatility Reduction (CLVR). This algorithm constructs an ordering which approximately minimizes price volatility with a small computation cost. We also provide insight into the strategy changes that may occur if traders are subject to this sequencing algorithm.</description>
