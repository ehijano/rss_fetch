      <title>Analysis of Channel Uncertainty in Trusted Wireless Services via Repeated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous sub-networks in 6G poses new security and trust concerns and thus calls for a perimeterless-security model. Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) provides a trust-building approach via repeated interactions rather than relying on pre-established trust or central authentication. Such a trust-building process naturally supports dynamic trusted services across various service providers (SP) without the need for perimeter-based authentications; however, it remains vulnerable to environmental and system unreliability such as wireless channel uncertainty. In this study, we investigate channel unreliability in the trust-building framework based on repeated interactions for secure wireless services. We derive specific requirements for achieving cooperation between SP and client via a repeated game model and illustrate the implications of channel unreliability on sustaining trusted access services. We consider the framework optimization to guarantee SP-client cooperation, given a worst-case channel condition. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of cooperation region to represent the robustness of the trust-building process and explore the maximum cooperation area to enhance service resilience. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate the system performance over fading channels and verify our results.</description>

      <title>CloudCap (C2app) : A Cloud-Based Platform for Packet Analysis On The Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data exchange through mobile devices is rapidly increasing due to the high information demands of today's applications. The need for monitoring the exchanged traffic becomes important in order to control and optimize the device and network performance and security. Taking this under consideration, in this paper, we developed a cloud-based system for the analysis of network traffic. The smartphone devices act both as traffic captors and visualization endpoints, enabling the user to get an overview of the network while minimizing resource consumption. In the presented work, we evaluate our system using two test cases and a variety of target devices. Our results prove the usefulness of the proposed system architecture.</description>

      <title>System for Measurement of Electric Energy Using Beacons with Optical Sensors and LoRaWAN Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the results of experiments with finding an efficient radio transmission method for an electric energy measurement system called OneMeter 2.0. This system offers a way of collecting energy usage data from beacons attached to regular, non-smart meters. In our study, we compared several low power wide area network (LPWAN) protocols, out of which we chose the LoRaWAN protocol. We verified the energy consumption of a LoRa-based transmission unit, as well as the transmission range between network nodes in urban conditions. We discovered that LoRaWAN-based transmission was highly energy-efficient and offered decent coverage, even in a difficult, dense urban environment.</description>

      <title>A Communication Satellite Servises Based Decentralized Network Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a decentralized network protocol, Space Network Protocol, based on Communication Satellite Services. The protocol outlines a method for distributing information about the status of satellite communication services across the entire blockchain network, facilitating fairness and transparency in all communication services. Our primary objective is to standardize the services delivered by all satellite networks under the communication satellite protocol. This standard remains intact regardless of potential unreliability associated with the satellites or the terminal hardware. We proposed PoD (Proof of Distribution) to verify if the communication satellites are online and PoF (Proof of Flow) to authenticate the actual data flow provided by the communication satellites. In addition, we also proposed PoM (Proof of Mesh) to verify if the communication satellites have successfully meshed together. Utilizing zero-knowledge proof and multi-party cryptographic computations, we can evaluate the service provisioning parameters of each satellite, even in the presence of potential terminal or network node fraud. This method offers technical support for the modeling of distributed network services.</description>

      <title>FedAQ: Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning via Joint Uplink and Downlink Adaptive Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm which leverages the data as well as the computational resources of clients, while protecting clients' data privacy. However, the substantial model size and frequent aggregation between the server and clients result in significant communication overhead, making it challenging to deploy FL in resource-limited wireless networks. In this work, we aim to mitigate the communication overhead by using quantization. Previous research on quantization has primarily focused on the uplink communication, employing either fixed-bit quantization or adaptive quantization methods. In this work, we introduce a holistic approach by joint uplink and downlink adaptive quantization to reduce the communication overhead. In particular, we optimize the learning convergence by determining the optimal uplink and downlink quantization bit-length, with a communication energy constraint. Theoretical analysis shows that the optimal quantization levels depend on the range of model gradients or weights. Based on this insight, we propose a decreasing-trend quantization for the uplink and an increasing-trend quantization for the downlink, which aligns with the change of the model parameters during the training process. Experimental results show that, the proposed joint uplink and downlink adaptive quantization strategy can save up to 66.7% energy compared with the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Significance in Remote Estimation of Discrete-State Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the semantics-aware remote estimation of a discrete-state Markov source with normal (low-priority) and alarm (high-priority) states. Erroneously announcing a normal state at the destination when the source is actually in an alarm state (i.e., missed alarm error) incurs a significantly higher cost than falsely announcing an alarm state when the source is in a normal state (i.e., false alarm error). Moreover, successive reception of an estimation error may cause significant lasting impact, e.g., maintenance cost and misoperations. Motivated by this, we assign different costs to different estimation errors and introduce two new age metrics, namely the Age of Missed Alarm (AoMA) and the Age of False Alarm (AoFA), to account for the lasting impact incurred by different estimation errors. Notably, the two age processes evolve dependently and can distinguish between different types of estimation errors and different synced states. The aim is to achieve an optimal trade-off between the cost of estimation error, lasting impact, and communication utilization. The problem is formulated as an average-cost, countably infinite state-space Markov decision process (MDP). We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching-type structure, making it amenable to policy storage and algorithm design. Notably, when the source is symmetric and states are equally important, the optimal policy has identical thresholds, i.e., threshold-type. Theoretical and numerical results underscore that our approach extends the current understanding of the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) and the cost of actuation error (CAE), showing that they are specific instances within our broader framework.</description>

      <title>Joint Metrics for EMF Exposure and Coverage in Real-World Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the downlink performance of cellular networks in terms of coverage and electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE), in the framework of stochastic geometry. The model is constructed based on datasets for sub-6~GHz macro cellular networks but it is general enough to be applicable to millimeter-wave networks as well. On the one hand, performance metrics are calculated for $\beta$-Ginibre point processes which are shown to faithfully model a large number of motion-invariant networks. On the other hand, performance metrics are derived for inhomogeneous Poisson point processes with a radial intensity measure, which are shown to be a good approximation for motion-variant networks. For both cases, joint and marginal distributions of the EMFE and the coverage, and the first moments of the EMFE are provided and validated by Monte Carlo simulations using realistic sets of parameters from two sub-6~GHz macro urban cellular networks, i.e., 5G~NR~2100 (Paris, France) and LTE~1800 (Brussels, Belgium) datasets. In addition, this paper includes the analysis of the impact of the network parameters and discusses the achievable trade-off between coverage and EMFE.</description>

      <title>On the Uplink and Downlink EMF Exposure and Coverage in Dense Cellular Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing studies analyzing electromagnetic field (EMFE) in wireless networks have primarily considered downlink communications. In the uplink, the EMFE caused by the user's smartphone is usually the only considered source of radiation, thereby ignoring contributions caused by other active neighboring devices. In addition, the network coverage and EMFE are typically analyzed independently for both the uplink and downlink, while a joint analysis would be necessary to fully understand the network performance and answer various questions related to optimal network deployment. This paper bridges these gaps by presenting an enhanced stochastic geometry framework that includes the above aspects. The proposed topology features base stations modeled via a homogeneous Poisson point process. The users active during a same time slot are distributed according to a mixture of a Mat\'ern cluster process and a Gauss-Poisson process, featuring groups of users possibly carrying several equipments. In this paper, we derive the marginal and meta distributions of the downlink and uplink EMFE and we characterize the uplink to downlink EMFE ratio. Moreover, we derive joint probability metrics considering the uplink and downlink coverage and EMFE. These metrics are evaluated in four scenarios considering BS, cluster and/or intracluster densifications. Our numerical results highlight the existence of optimal node densities maximizing these joint probabilities.</description>
