      <title>Strategic Attribute Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A researcher allocates a budget of informative tests across multiple unknown attributes to influence a decision-maker. We derive the researcher's equilibrium learning strategy by solving an auxiliary single-player problem. The attribute weights in this problem depend on how much the researcher and the decision-maker disagree. If the researcher expects an excessive response to new information, she forgoes learning altogether. In an organizational context, we show that a manager favors more diverse analysts as the hierarchical distance grows. In another application, we show how an appropriately opposed advisor can constrain a discriminatory politician, and identify the welfare-inequality Pareto frontier of researchers.</description>

      <title>Status substitution and conspicuous consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper adapts ideas from social identity theory to set out a new framework for modelling conspicuous consumption. Agents derive status from their own conspicuous consumption and from belonging to an identity group with high conspicuous consumption. Importantly, these two sources of status are substitutes. Agents also feel pressure to conform with their neighbours in a network. This framework can rationalise a set of seemingly conflicting stylised facts about conspicuous consumption that are currently explained by different families of models. In addition, our model delivers new testable predictions regarding the effect of network structure and income inequality on conspicuous consumption.</description>

      <title>Local non-bossiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The student-optimal stable mechanism (DA), the most popular mechanism in school choice, is the only one that is both stable and strategy-proof. However, when DA is implemented, a student can change the schools of others without changing her own. We show that this drawback is limited: a student cannot change her classmates while remaining in the same school. We refer to this new property as local non-bossiness and use it to provide a new characterization of DA that does not rely on stability. Furthermore, we show that local non-bossiness plays a crucial role in providing incentives to be truthful when students have preferences over their colleagues. As long as students first consider the school to which they are assigned and then their classmates, DA induces the only stable and strategy-proof mechanism. There is limited room to expand this preference domain without compromising the existence of a stable and strategy-proof mechanism.</description>

      <title>Risk aggregation and stochastic dominance for a class of heavy-tailed distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of heavy-tailed distributions for which any weighted average of independent and identically distributed random variables is larger than one such random variable in (usual) stochastic order. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to this class. The established stochastic dominance relation can be further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables dominates their distribution mixtures in stochastic order.</description>
