      <title>On the microlocal phase space concentration of Schr\"odinger evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microlocal properties of the evolutions of Schr\"odinger equations using metaplectic Wigner distributions. So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schr\"odinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies.</description>

      <title>Higher integrability for parabolic PDEs with generalized Orlicz growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove higher integrability of the gradient of weak solutions to nonlinear parabolic systems whose prototype is \[ \partial_t u-\mathrm{div}\Big(\frac{\varphi'(z, |\nabla u|)}{|\nabla u|}\nabla u\Big) =0, \qquad u=(u^1,\dots,u^N), \] where $\varphi$ is a generalized Young function. Special cases of our main theorem include previously known results for the $p$-growth, the variable exponent and the double phase growth. Also included are previously unknown borderline double phase growth and perturbed variable exponent growth, among others. The problem is controlled by a natural requirement of comparison of $\varphi$ between points in intrinsic parabolic cylinders via an (A1)-condition, which unifies disparate conditions from the special cases. Moreover, we handle both the singular and degenerate cases at the same time, providing a simple proof of a reverse H\"older type inequality, which is new even in the $p$-growth case.</description>

      <title>Viability Theory in the $1$-Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish necessary and sufficient viability conditions for continuity inclusions over the 1-Wasserstein space. Depending on the regularity properties of the dynamics, we derive two results which are based on fairly different proof strategies. When the admissible velocities are Lipschitz in the measure variable, we show that it is necessary and sufficient for viable solutions to exist that the latter intersect the graphical derivative of the constraints. On the other hand, when the admissible velocities are merely upper semicontinuous in the measure variable, we provide a sufficient condition for viability involving the infinitesimal behaviour of their Aumann integral over a neighbouring set of measures.</description>

      <title>Structured Continuity Equations in Fibred Wasserstein Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a comprehensive ODE-theory for structured continuity equations in fibred probability spaces, which represent a class of heterogeneous PDEs arising as the meanfield limit nonexchangeable particle systems. After investigating in depth the topologies induced by the so-called fibred and classical Wasserstein metrics on such probability spaces, we establish quantitative Cauchy-Lipschitz and qualitative Carath\'eodory-Peano well-posedness results for structured continuity equations, along with precise correspondences between this class of evolutions, classical Lagrangian dynamics, and continuity equations. In keeping with what has long been known for exchangeable dynamics, we derive a general meanfield approximation result by solutions of nonexchangeable particle systems, along with a quantitative variant thereof under practically reasonable regularity assumptions on the driving field and initial data.</description>

      <title>On the Schiffer and Berenstein conjectures for centrally symmetric convex domains in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, convex, centrally symmetric in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with a connected $C^{2,\epsilon}$ ($\epsilon\in(0,1)$) boundary. We show that, if the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=\alpha u\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, u=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partial\Omega,\,\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution corresponding to a sufficiently large eigenvalue $\alpha$, then $\Omega$ is a disk, which is the partially affirmative answer to the Berenstein conjecture. Similarly, we show that, if $\Omega$ has a Lipschitz connected boundary and the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=\alpha u\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partial\Omega,\,\,u =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution corresponding to a sufficiently large eigenvalue $\alpha$, then $\Omega$ is also a disk, which is the partially affirmative answer to the Schiffer conjecture.</description>

      <title>From the quantum Boltzmann operator to the quantum Landau operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we derive the quantum Landau operator as the weak-coupling limit of the quantum Boltzmann operator (also known as the Uehling-Uhlenbeck operator). We consider both Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. Our approach is inspired by the work by Benedetto and Pulvirenti, where the classical Landau operator was derived from the quantum Boltzmann operator. To capture the ternary term in the quantum Landau operator, we introduce a new two-parameter scaling that preserves the quantum effects in the limit. Furthermore, we provide an explicit rate of convergence that depends on the regularity of the interaction potential.</description>

      <title>Control and stabilization problem for a class of fourth-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on boundaryless compact manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the control and stabilization problem for a class of fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation on compact manifold without boundary with dimensions $d\in[1,5]$:
  \begin{align*}
  i\partial_tu+(\Delta_g^2-\beta\Delta_g)u=|u|^{2k}u,
  \end{align*}
  where $k\in\Bbb N$.
  For $1\leq d\leq4$ and $k\geq1$, we combine the method proposed by Loyola and semiclassical analysis to prove the stabilization result only under the geometric control condition (GCC), which removes the unique continuation assumption in Capistrano-Filho-Pampu [Math. Z. (2022)]. For $d=5$, we focus on a special case, i.e. $\Bbb S^5$. Establishing the propagation of singularity in Bourgain space, we prove the similar control and stabilization result in energy space as lower dimensions, which generalizes the result of Laurent [SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2009)].</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann equation in an infinite layer: spectrum and asymptotics toward the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we develop spectral theory to analyze the sharp asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Boltzmann equation around global Maxwellians in a three-dimensional infinite layer $\mathbb{R}^2\times (-1,1)$. The isothermal diffuse reflection boundary condition is imposed on two parallel infinite planes at $x_3=\pm 1$. The main difficulties lie in the fact that the direct Fourier transform is not applicable to the vertical $x_3$-variable, and the linear collision operator $K$ loses its compactness on $L^2((-1,1)\times \R^3_v)$ although it is compact on $L^2(\R^3_v)$. By introducing a regularization operator $K_n$ via the finite-dimensional Fourier series truncation in $L^2(-1,1)$, we study the spectrum of the linearized initial-boundary value approximation problem, establish the resolvent estimates, and identify the leading diffusive eigenvalue. This spectral structure governs the sharp asymptotic dynamics of the original linear problem as $n\to \infty$, enabling us to construct the large-time behavior for the nonlinear problem and rigorously prove that the solution converges with a faster rate toward that of the two-dimensional heat equation in the horizontal direction.</description>

      <title>Equi-integrable approximation of Sobolev mappings between manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that limits of sequences of smooth maps between compact Riemannian manifolds with equi-integrable $W^{1, p}$-Sobolev energy can always be strongly approximated by smooth maps, giving a counterpart of Hang's density result in $W^{1, 1}$ for the Sobolev space $W^{1, p}$ with integer $p \ge 2$. Our result extends to higher-order Sobolev spaces and is straightforward in fractional Sobolev spaces. We also provide a proof based on the weak continuity of Jacobians in the cases where the cohomological criterion of Bethuel, Demengel, Colon and H\'elein applies.</description>

      <title>A not-so-strange term coming from somewhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Laplace's equation in a periodically perforated domain, with Robin boundary conditions on the holes and a Robin coefficient inversely proportional to the total surface area of the holes. We show that, in a certain critical regime, the homogenised equation contains an additional zero-order term, which depends nonlinearly on the Robin coefficient. This additional term is defined in terms of solutions to a Steklov-type spectral problem, where the eigenvalue appears both in the equation and the boundary conditions. The ``strange term'' for the problem with Robin conditions converges to zero as the Robin parameter tends to zero and, at least under suitable assumptions, it converges to the capacitary ``strange term'' for the Dirichlet problem as the Robin parameter tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problem for a Schr\"odinger-type equation related to the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem in the space $H^1(\Sigma)$ for a nonlinear damped Schr\"odinger equation of the form \[ i u_t + \Delta u + i \lambda u \, \zeta(|u|+1) = 0, \quad u(0,x) = u_0, \] where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. This equation involves a damping term inspired by a fundamental object from number theory. We first establish the uniqueness of solutions in the sense of distributions. Then, by considering a regularized problem, we prove the existence of a global solution in $H^1(\Sigma)$, using uniform energy estimates and compactness arguments. Finally, we show that the limiting solution indeed satisfies the original equation in the weak sense,In the last part of this work, we provide an explicit estimate for the mass associated with the equation \begin{equation}\tag{E0}\label{5454} i v_t + \Delta v + i\lambda \frac{v}{|v|} = 0, \qquad v(0,x)=v_0.</description>

Abstract: We study the isentropic compressible Euler equations in multi-dimensions with stochastic perturbation of transport type. On the one hand, this is motivated by the physical modelling in turbulence theory. On the other hand, it has been shown recently that this type of noise can have regularising effects. In this paper, we prove the existence of dissipative measure-valued martingale solutions, the weak-strong uniqueness property and the existence of Markov selections.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of least energy solutions to the nonlinear Hartree equation near critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study that the nearly critical nonlocal problem \begin{equation*} \left\lbrace \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta u=(|x|^{-{(n-2)}}\ast u^{p-\epsilon})u^{p-1-\epsilon} \quad \mbox{in}\quad \Omega,
  &amp;u&gt;0\quad \mbox{in}\quad\hspace{1mm} \Omega,
  &amp;u=0\quad \mbox{on}\hspace{2.5mm}\partial\Omega,
  \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n=3,4,5$, $\ast$ denotes the standard convolution, $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a small parameter and $p=\frac{n+2}{n-2}$ is energy-critical exponent.
  We study the asymptotic behavior of least energy solutions as $\epsilon\rightarrow0$. These solutions are shown to blow-up at exactly one point $x_0$ and location of this point is characterized. In addition, the shape and exact rates for blowing-up are studied. Finally, in order to further locate the blowing-up point $x_0$, we prove that $x_0$ is a global maximum point of the Robin's function of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Rate independent capillary motion on a narrow Wilhelmy plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a rate independent energetic model of the Wilhelmy plate experiment in capillarity. The evolution is driven by vertical motions of the plate. We show stability of energy solutions to the evolution, in the sense used in the rate-independent systems literature, as the ratio between container width and plate width goes to infinity. In particular, we show that the volume-constraint for the finite-ratio problem disappears in the limit. This leads to a volume-unconstrained Dirichlet-forced evolution, a setting where monotonicity, uniqueness, and contact line regularity properties have been established in previous literature.
  Our result is based on using comparison principle techniques for the prescribed mean curvature equation with capillary contact angle condition that characterizes the liquid surface at equilibrium. Through barrier arguments, we are able to develop asymptotics for the energy which give us control independent of the container-to-plate ratio.</description>

      <title>A Calder\'on Problem for the Dirac operator with chiral boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider on a spin manifold with boundary a Dirac operator $D_A$ with chiral boundary conditions, twisted by a unitary connection $A$. When $m$ is not in the chiral spectrum of $D_A$, we define an analogue of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Dirac equation $D_A - m$, which we call the boundary conjugation map, and show that it is a pseudodifferential operator of order $0$ on the boundary. We show that in dimension greater than 2, its symbol determines the Taylor series of the metric and connection modulo gauge on the boundary when $m \neq 0$ and $m^2$ is not in the Dirichlet spectrum of $D_A^2$. We go on to show that a real-analytic Riemannian manifold and twisted spinor bundle with twisted spin connection can be recovered from its boundary conjugation map. Under further hypotheses, one can recover the unitary connection up to global gauge equivalence and the complex spinor bundles. Similar results hold in dimension $2$ when the auxiliary bundle and connection are absent.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions to a class of Laplace equations with a gradient term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate positive solutions to a class of Laplace equations with a gradient term on a complete, connected, and noncompact Riemannian manifold \((M^n,g)\) with nonnegative Ricci curvature, namely \[-\Delta u = f(u)|\nabla u|^q\quad\text{in }~M^n,\] where \(n\geqslant 3\), \(q&gt;0,\) and \(f\) is a positive continuous function. We prove some Liouville theorems employing a key differential identity derived via the invariant tensor technique. In particular, for \(f(u)=u^{\frac{2-q}{n-2}(n+\frac{q}{1-q})-1}\) is the second critical case in dimension \(n=3,4,5\), without any additional conditions, such as integrable conditions on \(u\), we show the rigidity for the ambient manifold and classification result of positive solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first rigidity result for equations with gradient terms in the second critical case. Moreover, this result confirms that all solutions must be of the form found in \cite{BV-GH-V2019}.</description>

      <title>Extremals for sharp Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities: periodically perforated sets and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider periodically perforated unbounded open sets and prove existence of extremals for the relevant sharp Poincar\'e-Sobolev embedding constant. The existence result holds no matter the shape or the regularity of the hole: it is sufficient that the latter is a compact set with positive capacity. We also show how to apply the main result in order to get a similar existence statement, for sets which are periodic in some directions and bounded in all the others.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and uniqueness of the positive solution for the critical Hartree equation on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the moving plane method in integral forms to classify the positive solutions of the critical Hartree equation on Heisenberg group \begin{equation}\label{0.1}
  -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u=\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\xi)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\zeta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\xi\right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u,~~~\zeta,\xi\in\mathbb{H}^{n}, \end{equation} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}$ denotes the Kohn Laplacian, $u(\xi)$ is a real-valued function, $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $\mu\in (0,Q)$ is a real parameter and $Q^{\ast}_{\mu}=\frac{2Q-\mu}{Q-2}$ is the upper critical exponent associated with the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group. By introducing the $\mathbb{H}$-reflection, we prove that the solutions of (\ref{0.1}) are cylindrical, upto Heisenberg translation and suitable scaling of function \begin{equation*}\label{0.2} u_{0}(\zeta)=u_{0}(z,t)=\left((1+|z|^{2})^{2}+t^{2}\right)^{-\frac{Q-2}{4}},~~~\zeta=(z,t)\in \mathbb{H}^{n}. \end{equation*} Furthermore, we show that these positive solutions are also CR inversion-symmetric with respect to the unit CC sphere. Consequently, we establish the uniqueness of positive solutions to equation (\ref{0.1}).</description>

      <title>A sharp Sobolev inequality on the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, the sharp classical Sobolev inequality is equivalent by conformal invariance to a Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$. This inequality is sharp in dimension $d\geq 4$, but it is not in dimension $d=3$ by results of Benguria, Frank and Loss, as well as Mancini and Sandeep. In this article, we investigate a similar phenomenon for the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality and its hyperbolic analogue. In our setting, the condition for improving the inequality reads $n\in [3,4)$, where $n$ is an ``effective dimension''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the development of the Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) formalism (the Fokas method) for the Camassa-Holm equation under periodic boundary conditions. Particularly, we present a representation of the solution to this problem in terms of the solution of the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem, the data for which are determined by the initial data for the problem in terms of the associated spectral functions.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow up solutions for heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions on $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions $$ \begin{cases} u_{t}=\Delta u &amp; \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}_{+}^{4} \times(0, T) ,\\ -\frac{d u}{d x_{4}}(\tilde{x}, 0, t) \ =u^2(\tilde{x}, 0, t)&amp; \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{3} \times(0, T). \end{cases} $$ We establish the existence of a finite-time blow-up solution. Specifically, for any sufficiently small $T&gt;0$ and any $k$ distinct points $q_{1},\dots,q_{k}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}$, there exists an initial datum $u_{0}$ such that the corresponding solution $u(x,t)$ blows up exactly at $q_{1},\dots,q_{k}$ as $t\nearrow T$. Furthermore, when $t\nearrow T$, the solution admits the asymptotic profile $$u(x,t)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}U_{\mu_{j}(t),\xi_{j}(t)}(x)+Z_0^*(x)+o(1)\quad \text{as}~ t\nearrow T,$$ where $$U_{\mu_{j}(t),\xi_{j}(t)}(x):=\mu_{j}^{-1}(t) U\left(\frac{x-\xi_{j}(t)}{\mu_{j}(t)}\right),~ x\in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{4},$$ and $Z_{0}^{*}\in C_{0}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}_{+}^{4})$ satisfying $$Z_{0}^{*}(q_{j},0)&lt;0\quad \text{for all}\ j=1,\dots,k.$$ Here, $U(y)$ denotes the harmonic extension to $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{4}$ of the positive radially symmetric solution $\widetilde{U}$ to the fractional Yamabe problem $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}} \widetilde{U} = \widetilde{U}^{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. For some constants $\beta_{j}&gt;0$, the scaling parameters $\mu{j}(t)$ and the translation parameters $\xi_{j}(t)$ satisfy $$\mu_{j}(t)=\beta_{j}\frac{|\log 2T|(T-t)}{|\log(T-t)|^{2}}(1 + o(1)) \to 0,~\xi_{j}(t)\to (q_{j},0)\quad \text{as} ~t\nearrow T.$$</description>

      <title>Analyticity in space and time for global solutions to the anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations in the critical $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the real analyticity of the global solutions to the $3$D incompressible anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations. We show that if only the horizontal component of initial velocity is small and analytic in $x_3$, then there exists a unique global solution which is analytic in $t&gt;0$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}^3$. Our functional framework lies in some anisotropic Besov spaces based on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first contribution to the well-posedness of the anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations in function spaces of the Besov type based on the full $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, we prove that in the small energy limit, any sequence of breathers decomposes into a finite sum of decoupled, periodically modulated canonical solitons. Each of these solitons is asymptotically equal to an explicit sine-Gordon breather and the distance between them grows to infinity as the energy decreases to 0. Finally we prove that none of these breathers is centered in a bounded set provided that a certain non resonance condition holds.</description>

      <title>The modified Novikov-Veslov Equation and the Inverse Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper corrects several errors in the author's previous papers (Journal of Spectral Theory 2016, Analysis and PDE 2014) on the Davey-Stewartson II (DS II) and modified Novikov-Veselov (mNV) equations. In each of these papers a proof was given that the solution by inverse scattering yields a classical solution to the PDE. The mNV equation lies in the integrable hierarchy of the DS II equation, so the same scattering transform may be used in both cases. In the 2014 paper, an incorrect formula is given for the nonlinearity in the mNV equation. Here we correct errors in the proof and obtain a correct statement of the mNV equation as solved by inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Extension and neural operator approximation of the electrical impedance tomography inverse map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of noise-robust neural operator approximation for the solution map of Calder\'on's inverse conductivity problem. In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the lower semi continuity of the Morse index and the upper continuity of the Morse Index plus nullity of sequences of critical points of the Sacks-Uhlenbeck type relaxation of the Yang-Mills Energy in 4 dimension. The result is known not to be true in general for the ``cousin problem'' of hamonic maps from surfaces into arbitrary manifolds. This result is stressing the more stable behaviour of Yang-Mills Fields compare to harmonic maps as observed in other contexts such as the flow. The Morse Index control at the limit of critical points to Sacks Uhlenbeck relaxations of Yang-Mills Lagrangian is a central result in the implementation of minmax operation on this Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Hearing the Serre invariant of a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a previous novel way of defining kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators on a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold $X$, one such operator $\Delta_0^s$ with $s\in\mathds{R}$ is applied to hearing the Serre invariant $i(X)$ by showing that a wavelet eigenvalue is always congruent to $i(X)$ modulo $q-1$, where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field $k$ attached to a $p$-adic number field $K$. It is shown how the number of $k$-rational points of the special fibre of the N\'eron model of an elliptic curve defined over $K$ relates to the wavelet spectrum of $\Delta^s_0$, and this then leads to the realisation that the Serre invariant $i(E(X))$ in the case of an elliptic curve $E$ with split multiplicative reduction vanishes modulo $q-1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a ferromagnetic nanowire, with an energy functional E with easy-axis in the direction $e_1$, and which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We consider configurations of the magnetization which are perturbations of two well separated domain wall, and study their evolution under the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert flow associated to E. Our main result is that, if the two walls have opposite speed, these configurations are asymptotically stable, up to gauges intrinsic to the invariances of the energy E. Our analysis builds on the framework developed in [4], taking advantage that it is amenable to space localisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a free boundary model to example the effect of vesicle transport onto neurite growth. It consists of systems of drift-diffusion equations describing the evolution of the density of antero- and retrograde vesicles in each neurite coupled to reservoirs located at the soma and the growth cones of the neurites, respectively. The model allows for a change of neurite length depending on the vesicle concentration in the growth cones. After establishing existence and uniqueness for the time-dependent problem, we briefly comment on possible types of stationary solutions. Finally, we provide numerical studies on biologically relevant scales using a finite volume scheme. We illustrate the capability of the model to reproduce cycles of extension and retraction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck operators of the form $$ \mathcal{L}u=\sum_{i,j=1}^{q}a_{ij}(x,t)u_{x_{i}x_{j}}+\sum_{k,j=1}^{N} b_{jk}x_{k}u_{x_{j}}-\partial_{t}u, $$ with $\left( x,t\right) \in\mathbb{R}^{N+1},N\geq q\geq1$. We assume that $a_{ij}\in L^{\infty}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) $, the matrix $\left\{ a_{ij}\right\} $ is symmetric and uniformly positive on $\mathbb{R}^{q}$, and the drift \[ Y=\sum_{k,j=1}^{N}b_{jk}x_{k}\partial_{x_{j}}-\partial_{t} \] has a structure which makes the model operator with constant $a_{ij}$ hypoelliptic, translation invariant w.r.t. a suitable Lie group operation, and $2$-homogeneus w.r.t. a suitable family of dilations. We also assume that the coefficients $a_{ij}$ are $VMO$ w.r.t. the space variable, and only bounded measurable in $t$. We prove, for every $p\in\left( 1,\infty\right) $, global Sobolev estimates of the kind: \begin{align*} \Vert u\Vert _{W_{X}^{2,p}(S_{T})} \equiv &amp; \sum_{i,j=1}^{q}\Vert u_{x_{i}x_{j}}\Vert_{L^{p}(S_{T})}
  +\Vert Yu\Vert _{L^{p}(S_{T})} +\sum_{i=1}^{q}\Vert u_{x_{i}}\Vert _{L^{p}(S_{T})} +\Vert u\Vert _{L^{p}(S_{T})} \\ &amp; \leq c\big\{ \Vert \mathcal{L}u\Vert _{L^{p}(S_{T})}+\Vert u\Vert_{L^{p}(S_{T})}\big\}
  \end{align*} with $S_{T}=\mathbb{R}^{N}\times\left( -\infty,T\right) $ for any $T\in(-\infty,+\infty]$. Also, the well-posedness in $W_{X}^{2,p}(\Omega_{T})$, with $\Omega_{T}=\mathbb{R}^{N}\times(0,T) $ and $T\in\mathbb{R}$, of the Cauchy problem% $$ \begin{cases} \mathcal{L}u=f &amp; \text{in $\Omega_{T}$} \\ u(\cdot,0) =g &amp; \text{in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$} \end{cases} $$ is proved, for $f\in L^{p}(\Omega_{T}), g\in W_{X}^{2,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caffarelli's contraction theorem bounds the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-convex measure and a strongly log-concave measure. We show that an analogous phenomenon holds on the level of the trace: The trace of the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-subharmonic measure and a strongly log-concave measure is bounded. We show that this trace bound has a number of consequences pertaining to volume-contracting transport maps, majorization and its monotonicity along Wasserstein geodesics, growth estimates of log-subharmonic functions, the Wehrl conjecture for Glauber states, and two-dimensional Coulomb gases. We also discuss volume-contraction properties for the Kim-Milman transport map</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equivalence between the $L^p$-parabolicity, the $L^q$-Liouville property of positive super-harmonic functions, and the existence of nonharmonic positive solutions to the following elliptic differential system
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -\Delta u\geq 0,
  \Delta(|\Delta u|^{p-2}\Delta u)\geq 0,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation*} 
  on weighted graphs, where $1\leq p&lt; \infty$, and $(p, q)$ are H\"{o}lder conjugate exponent pair. Furthermore, by refining a new technique on estimate of heat kernel, we can establish two-sided estimates of Green function on graph, and find the sharp volume growth criteria for the $L^q$-Liouville property on a large class of graphs. As an application, many non-trivial interesting examples are presented.</description>

      <title>New Liouville type theorems for 3D steady incompressible MHD equations and Hall-MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Liouville type results for the three-dimensional stationary incompressible MHD equations and Hall-MHD equations. Using the energy method and an iteration argument, we establish Liouville type theorems if Lebesgue norms of the velocity and magnetic field on the annulus satisfy certain growth conditions. Furthermore, by establishing new energy estimates and developing some novel differential inequality techniques, we relax the growth conditions by logarithmic factors and obtain logarithmic improvement version of Liouville type theorems. For the MHD equations, the assumptions imposed on the magnetic field are weaker and wider than that of the velocity field in certain sense. Our results extend and improve several recent works.</description>

      <title>Another look at quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with prescribed mass via dual method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the existence of ground state normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $-\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=h(u)+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N$, under the mass constraint $\int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a,$ where $N\geq2$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $h$ is a nonlinear reaction term with some suitable conditions. By employing a suitable transformation $u=f(v)$, we reformulate the original problem into the equivalent form $-\Delta v =h(f(v))f'(v)+\lambda f(v)f'(v),\,\, x\in\R^N,$ with prescribed mass $ \int_{\R^N}|f(v)|^2\text{d}x=a. $ To address the challenge posed by the $L^2$-norm $\|f(v)\|^2_2$ not necessarily equaling
  $a$, we introduce a novel stretching mapping: $ v_t(x):=f^{-1}(t^{N/2}f(v(tx))). $ This construction, combined with a dual method and detailed analytical techniques, enables us to establish the following existence results:
  (1)Existence of solutions via constrained minimization using dual methods;
  (2) Existence of ground state normalized solutions under general
  $L^2$-supercritical growth conditions, along with nonexistence results, analyzed via dual methods;
  (3)Existence of normalized solutions under critical growth conditions, treated via dual methods.
  Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy obtained in {\bf(P2)}. Our results extend and refine those of Colin-Jeanjean-Squassina [Nonlinearity 20: 1353-1385, 2010], of Jeanjean-Luo-Wang [J. Differ. Equ. 259: 3894-3928, 2015], of Li-Zou [Pacific J. Math. 322: 99-138, 2023], of Zhang-Li-Wang [Topol. Math. Nonl. Anal. 61: 465-489, 2023] and so on. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of normalized solutions for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations via the dual method.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity and anti-maximum principles for semilinear and linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with existence and qualitative properties of positive solutions of semilinear elliptic equations in bounded domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show the existence of positive solutions in the vicinity of the linear equation and the log-concavity of the solutions when the domain is strictly convex. We also review the standard results on the log-concavity or the more general quasi-concavity of solutions of elliptic equations. The existence and other convergence results especially rely on the maximum principle, on a quantified version of the anti-maximum principle, on the Schauder fixed point theorem, and on some a priori estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following nonlinear elliptic system of Hamiltonian type with critical exponents: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u + V(|y'|,y'')\, u = |v|^{p-1}v, &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N,\newline
  -\Delta v + V(|y'|,y'')\, v = |u|^{q-1}u, &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $(y', y'') \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$, $V(|y'|, y'') \not\equiv 0$ is a bounded, nonnegative function on $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$ and $p, q &gt; 1$ lie on the critical hyperbola: \[
  \frac{1}{p+1} + \frac{1}{q+1} = \frac{N-2}{N}. \] By applying the finite-dimensional reduction method and local Pohozaev identities combined with the Green representation formula and technical analysis, we show that, under the assumptions that $N \ge 5$, $(p,q)$ lies in a certain admissible range, and $r^2 V(r, y'')$ has a stable critical point, the above problem admits infinitely many solutions whose energy can be made arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Moving boundary problems for a novel extended mKdV equation. Application of Ermakov-Painlev\'e II symmetry reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel extension of the canonical solitonic mKdV equation is introduced which admits hybrid Ermakov-Painlev\'e II symmetry reduction. Application of the latter is made to obtain exact solution of Airy-type to a class of moving boundary problems of Stefan kind for this extended mKdV equation. A reciprocal transformation is then applied to the latter to generate an associated exactly solvable class of moving boundary problems for an extension of a base Casimir member of a compacton hierachy. The extended mKdV equation is shown to be embedded in a range of nonlinear evolution equations with temporal modulation as determined via the action of a class of involutory transformations with origin in Ermakov theory. Associated temporal modulation for the hybrid mKdV and KdV equation as embedded in the classical solitonic Gardner equation is delimited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasilinear Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations on bounded smooth convex domains. We show that the quasilinear Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations arise naturally from stochastic optimal control problems with exit-time costs. The PDE is obtained via dynamic programming applied to controlled It\^{o} diffusions, providing both a probabilistic interpretation and a rigorous derivation. Our result establishes existence and uniqueness of positive classical solutions under sub-quadratic growth conditions on the source term. The constructive proofs, based on monotone iteration and barrier techniques, also provide a framework for algorithmic implementation with applications in production planning and image restoration. We provide complete detailed proofs with rigorous estimates and establish the connection to stochastic control theory through the dynamic programming principle.</description>

      <title>Optimal uniform regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to Lotka-Volterra type systems with strong competition and asymmetric coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the following Lotka-Volterra type system of strong competition with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
  \begin{align*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u_{i,\beta} = f_{i,\beta}(x, u_{i,\beta}) - \beta u_{i,\beta}^{p_i} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^k a_{ij} u_{j,\beta}^{p_j}, \quad u_{i,\beta} &gt; 0 &amp; \text{in } \Omega,
  u_{i,\beta} = \varphi_{i,\beta} &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{array}\right.
  \end{align*}
  where $N \geq 1$, $1 \leq i \leq k$ with $k \geq 3$, $\beta &gt; 0$, $p_i \geq 1$, $a_{ij} &gt; 0$ for $i \neq j$, and $\Omega$ is a $C^{1,\text{Dini}}$ bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$. First, we prove that the uniform boundedness of the solutions implies their uniform interior and global Lipschitz boundedness as $\beta \to +\infty$. Such uniform results are optimal; partial versions thereof are known in the literature for symmetric coefficients (i.e., $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all $i \neq j$) and homogeneous competition terms (i.e., $p_i = p_j$ for all $i\neq j$). Here, we establish an Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman type monotonicity formula for the system and then employ blow-up analysis to show that these results also hold in the asymmetric or nonhomogeneous case. Next, as consequences of the uniform optimal regularity, we derive sharp quantitative pointwise estimates for the densities near the interface between different components.</description>

      <title>Vanishing viscosity limit of the 2D stationary Navier-Stokes equations outside a rotating disc and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the vanishing viscosity limit result of the 2D stationary Navier-Stokes equations outside a rotating disc. On the boundary of the disc, the fluid is subjected to a small perturbation of a non zero rotation of rigid body. While at the spacial infinity, the fluid stays at rest. Due to the Prandtl-Batchelor theory, the limiting Euler solution is chosen to be the rotation flow $\frac{A}{r} e_\theta$ for some suitable constant $A$, which is determined by the Batchelor-Wood formula. When the viscosity approaches to zero, we will construct a solution to the 2D Navier-Stokes equations by using higher order asymptotic approximation and show the validity of the boundary layer expansion. Also the asymptotic behavior of the solution at spacial infinity is obtained. Our result partially answers one of the open problems (Problem 11b) raised by V. I. Yudovich in [Eleven great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics, Mosc. Math. J. 3 (2003), no. 2, 711--737].
  As an application, we can show an existence result to the 2D stationary Navier-Stokes equations with fixed viscosity outside a disc when the fluid is subjected to a large perturbation of a fast rotation of rigid body at the boundary.</description>

      <title>A critical drift-diffusion equation: intermittent behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process with a time-independent and divergence-free random drift that is of white-noise character. We are interested in the critical case of two space dimensions, where one has to impose a small-scale cut-off for well-posedness, and is interested in the marginally super-diffusive behavior on large scales.
  In the presence of an (artificial) large-scale cut-off at scale L, as a consequence of standard stochastic homogenization theory, there exist harmonic coordinates with a stationary gradient $F_L$; the merit of these coordinates being that under their lens, the drift-diffusion process turns into a martingale.
  It has recently been established that the second moments diverge as $\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2\sim\sqrt{\ln L}$ for $L\uparrow\infty$. We quantitatively show that in this limit, and in the regime of small P\'eclet number, $|F_L|^2/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2$ is not equi-integrable, and that $\mathbb{E}|{\rm det}F_L|/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2 $ is small. Hence the Jacobian matrix of the harmonic coordinates is very peaked and non-conformal.
  We establish this asymptotic behavior by characterizing a proxy $\tilde F_L$ introduced in previous work as the solution of an It\^{o} SDE w. r. t. the variable $\ln L$, and which implements the concept of a scale-by-scale homogenization based on a variance decomposition and admits an efficient calculus. For this proxy, we establish $\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^4\gg(\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^2)^2$ and $\mathbb{E}({\rm det}\tilde F_L-1)^2\ll 1$. In view of the former property, we assimilate this phenomenon to intermittency. In fact, $\tilde F_L$ behaves like a tensorial stochastic exponential, and as a field can be assimilated to multiplicative Gaussian chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a new framework, \emph{simultaneous saturation}, designed to quantify the size of sets whose elements are simultaneously large. The framework establishes a correspondence between the magnitude of such sets and a system of interdependent conditions linking their points. We first prove a general theorem establishing the correspondence and then apply the framework to multilinear restriction-type estimates. From this perspective, we obtain a new proof (independent of Bennett-Carbery-Tao \cite{BCT}) of the $d$-linear restriction/extension theorem, and establish the $\lambda^{\epsilon}$ loss conjectured bounds for the $k$-linear $L^{2}\to L^{p/k}$ extension problem under mixed transversality/curvature conditions $(k&lt;d)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a finite-time stochastic drift control problem with the assumption that the control is bounded and the system is controlled until the state process leaves the half-line. Assuming general conditions, it is proved that the resulting parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation has a classical solution. In fact, we consider an even more general family of semilinear equations, which might be helpful in solving other control or game problems. Not only is the existence result proved, but also a recursive procedure for finding a solution resulting from a fixed-point argument is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and conditional uniqueness in the Krylov class for SDEs with singular divergence-free drifts in the endpoint critical Lorentz space $L^{\infty}(0,T; L^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$, $d \geqslant 2$, which particularly includes the $2$D Biot-Savart law. The uniqueness result is shown to be optimal in dimensions $d \geqslant 3$, by constructing different martingale solutions in the case of supercritical Lorentz drifts. As a consequence, the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular kernels is derived. In particular, this yields the uniqueness of the $2$D vorticity Navier-Stokes equations even in certain supercritical-scaling spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the path laws of solutions to McKean-Vlasov equations with critical singular kernel form a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean.</description>

      <title>Energy inequalities for cutoff functions of $p$-energies on metric measures spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $p&gt;1$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we provide various geometric and functional conditions for the validity of the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78 (2025), no. 9, 1523--1608].</description>

Abstract: Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.
  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.</description>
