      <title>Critical spacetime crystals in continuous dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically construct a one-parameter family of critical spacetimes in arbitrary continuous dimensions D&gt;3. This generalizes Choptuik's D=4 solution to spherically symmetric massless scalar-field collapse at the threshold of D-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole formation. We refer to these solutions, which share the discrete self-similarity of their four-dimensional counterpart, as critical spacetime crystals. Our main results are the echoing period and Choptuik exponent of the crystals as continuous functions of D, with detailed data for the interval 3.05&lt;D&lt;5.5. Notably, the echoing period has a maximum near D=3.76. As a by-product, we recover the echoing periods and Choptuik exponents in D=4 (5): Delta=3.445453 (3.22176) and gamma=0.373961 (0.41322). We support these numerical results with analytical expansions in 1/D and D-3. They suggest that both the echoing period and Choptuik exponent vanish as D approaches 3 from above. This paves the way for a small-(D-3) expansion, paralleling the large-$D$ expansion of general relativity. We also extend our results to two-dimensional dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Accelerated expansion of the universe purely driven by scalar field fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that scalar field fluctuations alone can drive cosmic acceleration, provided the universe is spatially closed and the Compton wavelength of the field exceeds the radius of curvature. This mechanism may open new perspectives on inflation and dark energy, which could arise from a gas of sufficiently light bosons in a closed universe.</description>

      <title>A class of $d$-dimensional regular black holes: Shadows, Thermodynamics and Gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a recently introduced class of regular black holes that can form from the collapse of a polytropic star with an arbitrary polytropic index. This class has a de Sitter core and reduces to the Bardeen and Hayward black holes when the polytropic index is chosen appropriately. We demonstrate that this class of black holes is sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian in $d$ dimensions and that its regularity stems from the presence of magnetic charge. We analyze the energy conditions and study the photon spheres analytically and the shadows numerically. Then, we compare our results with observations. Additionally, we present the thermodynamic properties of this class of black holes, including their temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also examine their thermodynamic stability. Finally, we generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt collapse scenario to this $d$-dimensional class of black holes and study stellar collapse into them, as well as the evolution of the star's surface, the apparent horizon, and the event horizon.</description>

      <title>The measurable impact of the 2pN spin-dependent accelerations on the jet precession of M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological production of dark matter in the Universe and in the laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry.
  The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion.
  Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Spacetime of rotating black holes surrounded by massive scalar charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive scalar charges are ubiquitous in extensions to General Relativity and the Standard Model in particle physics. We describe spectral methods which can accurately construct the spacetime of rotating black holes with dimensionless spin up to $a \leq 0.8$ surrounded by massive scalar fields nonminimally coupled to spacetime curvature. We consider axi dilaton, dynamical Chern Simons, and scalar Gauss Bonnet couplings, and obtain leading order solutions for both the scalar field and the associated metric modifications. Our method accurately resolves massive scalar fields with Compton wavelengths as short as 5 times the black hole mass, achieving residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-5}$, and yields the corresponding leading order spacetime modifications with residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Using the constructed spacetimes, we computes the leading-order shifts in the surface gravity and the angular velocity of the event horizon, important information for computing the quasinormal modes. These results pave the way to incorporate massive scalar charges into electromagnetic observations and gravitational-wave detections of black holes, potentially enabling new probes of fundamental scalar degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of slowly rotating black holes embedded in matter environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology in $f(R, T)$ Theory with Schutz's Perfect Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity extends general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational Lagrangian to depend on both the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schr\"odinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics.</description>

      <title>From mergers to collapse: scalarisation dynamics in neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully non-linear evolutions of binary neutron star mergers in a moving-punctures approach in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We study both linear and quadratic-type couplings between the scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and uncover new post-merger phenomena. These include an enhancement of the prompt collapse of a long-lived hyper-massive neutron star remnant and cases where the remnant develops a scalar configuration due to different scalarisation instabilities. This study initiates the exploration of beyond-General-Relativistic effects enhanced by the non-linear dynamics of the neutron star's fluid.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamical Regular Black Holes from Generalized Polytropic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of exact, dynamical, and fully analytic solutions describing regular black holes formed via the gravitational collapse of matter obeying a generalized polytropic equation of state. Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center.
  We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=\alpha\rho-\zeta\rho^{\gamma}$, where the polytropic index $\gamma$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters.
  Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter.</description>

      <title>Dust collapse and bounce in spherically symmetric quantum-inspired gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collapse and possible bounce of dust in quantum-inspired gravity models with spherical symmetry. Starting from a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we write down the covariant Hamiltonian constraints that under dynamical flow give rise to metrics of many spherically symmetric gravity models. Gravity is minimally coupled to a dust field. The constraint equations are solved for the Hamiltonian evolution and simple equations for the location of the outer boundary of the dust versus time and the apparent horizons in terms of shape functions are obtained. The dust density is not assumed to be homogeneous inside the collapsing ball. In many cases, the effective quantum gravity effects stop the collapse of the dust matter field, then causes the dust field to expand thus creating a bounce at a minimum radius and avoiding the classical singularity. Using this formalism, we examine several quantum-inspired gravity metrics to obtain bounce results either previously obtained by different methods or new results.</description>

      <title>Wave Propagation and Effective Refraction in Lorentz-Violating Wormhole Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of massless scalar waves in static, spherically symmetric Lorentz-violating wormhole spacetimes within a geometric-optical framework. Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in the Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate vacuum polarization on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole carrying a global monopole. For a massless scalar field $\Psi$ in the Hartle-Hawking state and with arbitrary curvature coupling, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value $\langle \Psi^2 \rangle_{\textrm{ren}}$. The monopole produces a solid-angle deficit and makes the spacetime non-Ricci-flat. Working perturbatively in the monopole parameter $\eta$ and retaining terms through $O(\eta^2)$, we find that $\langle \Psi^2 \rangle_{\textrm{ren}}$ on the horizon splits into two contributions: a genuinely monopole-induced term evaluated at the horizon and the usual Schwarzschild result - with the event horizon radius modified by the presence of $\eta$. Our result parallels earlier analyses for Schwarzschild black holes pierced by a cosmic string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the convergent Leaver method, we investigate the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field propagating in the background of the Casadio--Fabbri--Mazzacurati brane-world black hole. We show that the spectrum exhibits two distinct types of modes, depending on their behavior as the field mass $\mu$ increases. In one class, the real oscillation frequency decreases and eventually approaches zero, while in the other the damping rate tends to vanish. When either the real or imaginary part of the frequency reaches zero, the corresponding mode disappears from the spectrum, and the first overtone replaces it.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for tidal heating with extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) provide unique probes of near-horizon dissipation through the tidal heating. We present a full Bayesian analysis of tidal heating in equatorial eccentric EMRIs by performing injection-recovery studies and inferring posterior constraints on the reflectivity parameter $|\mathcal{R}|^2$ while sampling in the full EMRI parameter space. We find that in the strong-field regime the posterior uncertainties are smaller, indicating a stronger constraining capability on the tidal heating. Using two-year signals with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\rho=50$, EMRIs can put bounds on $|\mathcal{R}|^2$ at the level of $10^{-3}$--$ 10^{-4}$ for a rapidly spinning central object. Moreover, we show that neglecting the tidal heating can induce clear systematic biases in the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system. These results establish EMRIs as promising precision probes for detecting and constraining black hole event horizons.</description>

      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Curvature Correction to the Euclidean Action of Rotating AdS Black Holes in General Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt the improved Reall-Santos method to obtain the leading-order perturbative correction of the quadratic curvature invariants to the on-shell Euclidean action of rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in general $D$ dimensions. The corresponding Gibbs free energy is a function of thermodynamic variables, temperature and angular velocities, which are unperturbed in this approach.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Expansion Induces Interference Between Communication and Entanglement Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between genuine entanglement harvesting and communication mediated correlations for local particle detectors in expanding cosmological spacetimes. Focusing on a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze how spacetime expansion induces interference between these two sources of entanglement when the detectors are in causal contact. We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration that qubits can be cloned at will, if encrypted with a single-use decryption key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use.</description>

      <title>Classical strings and the double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy is by now a well-established relationship between scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in gauge and gravity (field) theories, and is itself inspired by amplitude relations in string theory. In this paper, we generalise the classical double copy to the motion of strings, taking as a case study the motion of an open string in a background abelian gauge field. We argue that the double copy of this situation is a closed string moving in a spacetime background arising as the double copy of the gauge theory background. The gauge theory background we consider is that of a constant electric field, which has a critical value beyond which the open string motion is pathological. We find no counterpart of this behaviour in the double copy, and interpret this result. We then examine how the closed string nevertheless still knows about the single copy gauge theory. Our results pave the way for more systematic study of the double copy in a classical string context, thus going beyond the KLT relations for amplitudes in flat space.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Formation Channel for Galactic Dual-Line Gravitational-Wave Sources: von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect in Triples Involving Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense Galactic Center environment is expected to host compact binary inspirals detectable by future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories (e.g., LISA, TianQin, Taiji) in the millihertz band. Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\sim 3$, from rare to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Yukawa-Coupled Fields Across a Rindler Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy across a Rindler horizon in scalar field theory with Yukawa interaction. Starting from a microscopic scalar-mediator theory in flat spacetime, we integrate out the massive mediator to obtain a quadratic but nonlocal effective kernel that determines the ground-state wavefunctional. The reduced density matrix for a single Rindler wedge is constructed explicitly by tracing over the complementary wedge, allowing the entanglement entropy to be evaluated directly from the kernel without replica or geometric methods. Exploiting translational invariance parallel to the horizon, the problem decomposes into independent transverse momentum sectors that reduce effectively to one-dimensional nonlocal systems and can be diagonalized analytically in the weak-coupling regime. The interaction-induced entropy obeys an area law, with leading corrections controlled by the Yukawa screening mass and logarithmically sensitive to the transverse ultraviolet cutoff, reflecting the localization of correlations near the horizon. Although the modular Hamiltonian depends on the Rindler acceleration, the entanglement spectrum and entropy are independent of this choice, demonstrating the observer-independent nature of vacuum entanglement. Our framework provides a direct and microscopically transparent approach to computing interaction-induced corrections to horizon entanglement using nonlocal effective kernels.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum gravitational corrections to the thermodynamical quantities of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within the framework of effective field theory. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at the one-loop level. We perform a complete thermodynamic analysis for both non-extremal and extremal black holes, and are mainly concerned about the shift in the charge-to-mass ratio $q/M$ that plays an important role in analyzing the weak gravity conjuecture. For non-extremal black holes, we identify a relationship between the shift in the charge-to-mass ratio and the thermodynamic stability of the black holes. For extremal black holes, we show that quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality $q/M&gt;1$ of charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.
  In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.
  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4).
  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac test field perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution. We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Pad\'e Averaging. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.</description>

      <title>Charged particle bound orbits around magnetized Schwarzschild black holes: S2 star and hotspot applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of charged particles around magnetized black holes provide valuable insights into astrophysical processes near compact objects. In this work, we investigate the bound and unbound trajectories of charged particles in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external, uniform magnetic field. By analyzing the effective potential and solving the corresponding equations of motion, we classify the possible orbital configurations and identify the critical parameters governing the transition between stable and escape trajectories. The influence of the magnetic field strength and particle charge on the orbital structure, energy, and angular momentum is systematically explored. Applications of the obtained results are discussed in the context of the S2 star orbiting Sagittarius A* and the motion of bright hotspots detected near the event horizon, offering a potential interpretation of recent observations in terms of magnetized dynamics. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of charged-particle motion around black holes and its relevance to high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the galactic center. Finally, we test our model by fitting it to real data from the observed trajectory of the S2 star using a statistical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This allows us to find the best estimates for magnetic field and charge of the S2 star.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures from Periodic Orbits around a non-commutative inspired black hole surrounded by quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational wave emission from periodic orbits of a test particle around a noncommutative-inspired black hole surrounded by quintessence. Using the zoom-whirl taxonomy, which is characterized by three topological numbers $(z, w, v)$, we classify these orbits and calculate several representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits. We find that the noncommutative parameter $\Theta$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $\Theta$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. These results suggest that future space-based gravitational wave missions could probe or constrain noncommutative effects in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Stability of spherical thin-shell wormholes in scalar-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct a family of spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes within scalar-tensor theories of gravity. In the case of wormholes symmetric across the throat, we study the matter content and analyze the stability of the static configurations under radial perturbations. We apply the formalism to a particular example involving Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled to a conformally invariant scalar field. We show that stable configurations are possible for suitable values of the parameters involved.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise characterization on the detection of mHz stochastic gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays' hint for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) leverages the expectations of a future detection in the millihertz band, particularly with the LISA space mission. However, finding an SGWB with a single orbiting detector is challenging: It calls for cautious modelling of instrumental noise, which is also mainly stochastic. It was shown that agnostic noise reconstruction methods provide robustness in the detection process. We build on previous work to include more realistic instrumental simulations and additional degrees of freedom in the noise inference model and analyze the impact of LISA's sensitivity to SGWBs. Particularly, we model the two main types of noise sources with separate transfer functions and power spectral density spline fitting. We assess the detectability bounds and their dependence on the flexibility of the noise model and on the prior probability, allowing us to refine previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by considering the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density within the framework of teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the inherent difficulties in the old models. Furthermore, the Nieh-Yan coupling causes parity violation in gravitational waves, and this can be considered as a clear prediction of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual. This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons, will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Crustal lattice pressure as a source of neutron star mountains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin frequencies of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries may be limited by the emission of gravitational waves. A candidate for producing such steady emission is a mass asymmetry, or "mountain", sourced by temperature asymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined temperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear species and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture layers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries. However, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of such deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative source of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the pressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that temperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be significant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations, self-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the perturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries, to establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the crustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the possibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and isolated neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, none of the metric model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of some exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties do not allow us to detect exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spinning test bodies in the Schwarzschild space-time: reduction and circular orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a rotating test body in the Schwarzschild space-time. After reduction, this problem reduces to an analysis of a three-degree-of-freedom. Hamiltonian system whose desired trajectories lie on the invariant manifold described by the Tulczyjew condition. An analysis is made of the fixed points of this system which describe the motion of the test body in a circle. New circular orbits are found for which the orbital angular momentum is not parallel to the angular momentum of the test body. Using a Poincare map, bifurcations of periodic solutions are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a coherent classical fluid model may recover the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can recover some of the simplest mathematical formalisms of quantum and relativistic theory.</description>

      <title>Observers, $\alpha$-parameters, and the Hartle-Hawking state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend recent ideas about observers and closed universes to theories where observers can be fluctuated into existence in the Hartle-Hawking state. This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $\alpha$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $\alpha$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS.</description>
