      <title>Shallow-water convergence of the intermediate long wave equation in $L^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study on the convergence issue of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) on both the real line and the circle. In particular, we establish convergence of the scaled ILW dynamics to that of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in the shallow-water limit at the $L^2$-level. Together with the recent work by the first three authors and D. Pilod (2024) on the deep-water convergence in $L^2$, this work completes the well-posedness and convergence study of ILW on both geometries within the $L^2$-framework. Our proof equally applies to both geometries and is based on the following two ingredients: the complete integrability of ILW and the normal form method. More precisely, by making use of the Lax pair structure and the perturbation determinant for ILW, recently introduced by Harrop-Griffths, Killip, and Vi\c{s}an (2025), we first establish weakly uniform (in small depth parameters) equicontinuity in $L^2$ of solutions to the scaled ILW, providing a control on the high frequency part of solutions. Then, we treat the low frequency part by implementing a perturbative argument based on an infinite iteration of normal form reductions for KdV.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Parameter Identification for Tumor Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling tumor growth accurately is essential for understanding cancer progression and informing treatment strategies. To estimate the parameters in the tumor growth model described by a nonlinear PDE, we adopt Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which show advantages especially when the observation data is scarce and contains noise. With the help of real-life lab data, we have demonstrated the potential of applying deep learning tools to address data-driven modeling for tumor growth in biology.</description>

      <title>An $L^2$-quantitative global approximation for the Stokes initial-boundary value problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first quantitative Runge approximation theorem, with explicit $L^2$-estimates, for the 3d nonstationary Stokes system on a bounded spatial domain. This result addresses the two primary limitations of the qualitative result [H.-Sueur, 2025] obtained in collaboration with Franck Sueur: first, it bypasses the non-constructive Hahn-Banach theorem used in [H.-Sueur, 2025], precluding quantitative estimates; and second, it extends the scope of the theory from interior approximations to the physically important initial-boundary value problem. Our proof is founded on the modern quantitative framework of [R\"{u}land-Salo, 2019], which we adapt to the Stokes system by combining semigroup theory with a quantitative approximation for the associated resolvent problem.</description>

      <title>Liouville--Type Results for Infinity Elliptic Equations Involving Gradient and Hardy--H\'enon Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study Liouville-type properties for a class of degenerate elliptic equations driven by the fractional infinity Laplacian with nonlinear lower-order terms, \[ \Delta_\infty^{\beta}u - c\,H(u,\nabla u) - \lambda\, f(|x|,u)=0 \qquad \text{in }\mathbb{R}^n, \] where $\beta\in[0,2]$, $\Delta_\infty^\beta$ denotes the fractional infinity Laplace operator, and the nonlinearities $H$ and $f$ represent Hamiltonian and Hardy--H\'enon type effects, respectively. We extend the Liouville theory for the classical and normalized infinity Laplacian by establishing a new weighted comparison principle together with sharp local Lipschitz estimates for viscosity solutions.
  Our Liouville theorems are derived from precise growth conditions for bounded nonnegative solutions when $f$ exhibits power-type behavior, i.e.\ $f\sim u^\gamma$. We also treat the exponential case $f\sim e^u$, for which the equation becomes strongly supercritical: under suitable assumptions on the growth of $u$ at spatial infinity, only partial Liouville-type conclusions can be obtained.
  The analysis relies on radial reduction, barrier constructions, and refined comparison arguments. Altogether, the results provide a unified framework linking regularity, comparison principles, and Liouville-type phenomena for degenerate elliptic equations involving fractional infinity Laplacians and nonlinear lower-order effects.</description>

      <title>On some uniqueness results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to extend the results of Serrin and Tang in [{\it Indiana Univ. Math. J., 49 (2000), 897--923}] to the low-dimensional case. Specifically, the paper deals with the radial solutions of the following overdetermined problem $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta_m u=f(u),\quad u&gt;0~\hbox{in}~B_R,\\ u=\partial_\nu u=0~\hbox{on}~\partial B_R, \end{cases} $$ where $B_R$ is the open ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$ centered at 0 and with radius $R&gt;0$. We prove uniqueness when $1\leq N\leq m$ {and $m&gt;1$} under certain suitable assumptions on~$f$. Additionally, this work is motivated by the sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg/Nash inequality. While the framework presented in this article is standard and closely resembles that of Serrin and Tang, the detail of our proofs differ significantly. It is important to note that Serrin and Tang explicitly stated (see Subsection~6.2 of their work) that {\it``the proofs in the present paper rely extensively on the assumption $N&gt;m$ and cannot be extended easily to values $N\leq m$."}</description>

      <title>Spreading Properties of a City-Road Reaction-Diffusion Model on One-Dimensional Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a new model to describe biological invasions constrained on infinite homogeneous one dimensional metric graphs. Our model consists of an infinite PDE-ODE system where, at each vertex of the one-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, we have a logistic equation, and connections between vertices are given by diffusion equations on the edges supplemented with Robin like boundary conditions at the vertices. We establish the main properties of the system and study the long time behavior of the solutions, especially by characterizing an asymptotic spreading speed for the system. In the fast diffusion regime, we derive a novel asymptotic model which exhibits similar propagation properties as the classical discrete Fisher-KPP on the one-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>The Immersed Boundary Problem in 2-D: the Navier-Stokes Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the immersed boundary problem in 2-D. It models a 1-D elastic closed string immersed and moving in a fluid that fills the entire plane, where the fluid motion is governed by the 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with a positive Reynolds number subject to a singular forcing exerted by the string. We introduce the notion of mild solutions to this system, and prove its existence, uniqueness, and optimal regularity estimates when the initial string configuration is $C^1$ and satisfies the well-stretched condition and when the initial flow field $u_0$ lies in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $p\in (2,\infty)$. A blow-up criterion is also established. When the Reynolds number is sent to zero, we show convergence in short time of the solution to that of the Stokes case of 2-D immersed boundary problem, with the optimal error estimates derived. We prove the energy law of the system when $u_0$ additionally belongs to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Lastly, we show that the solution is global when the initial data is sufficiently close to an equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior and sharp estimates for spreading fronts in a cooperative system with free boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of a reaction-diffusion system with two free boundaries, modeling the invasion of two cooperative species, where the free boundaries represent expanding fronts. We first analyze the long-term behavior of the system, showing that it follows a spreading-vanishing dichotomy: the two species either spread across the entire region or eventually die out. In the case of spreading, we determine the asymptotic spreading speed of the fronts by using a semi-wave system and provide sharp estimates for the moving fronts. Additionally, we show that the solution to the system converges to the corresponding semi-wave solution as time tends to infinity. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics of cooperative species in reaction-diffusion systems with free boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate wave scattering by a pair of closely spaced inclusions embedded in a homogeneous medium, characterized by a high contrast physical parameters. The system is modeled by the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. We show that this configuration exhibits two sub-wavelength resonant modes, whose frequencies display distinct leading-order asymptotic behaviors. These findings differ significantly from those in the three-dimensional Helmholtz setting. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative analysis of the gradient blow-up rates for the wave field localized between the two resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of convergence of a sequence of gradient flows defined on different Hilbert spaces. In order to give meaning to this idea, we introduce a notion of connecting operators. This permits us to generalize the concept of Mosco convergence of functionals to our present setting, and state a desired convergence result for gradient flows, which we then prove. We present a variety of examples, including thin domains, dynamic boundary conditions, and discrete-to-continuum limits.</description>

      <title>Regularity for elliptic equations with monomial weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity properties for solutions to elliptic equations that are degenerate or singular along orthogonal hyperplanes. The degenerate ellipticity is carried out by a weight term which is the monomial product of different powers of the distance functions to each hyperplane; that is, given the space dimension $d\geq2$, the number of orthogonally crossing hyperplanes $1\leq n\leq d$ and the generic variable point $z=(x,y)\in\mathbb R^{d-n}\times\mathbb R^n$, then the weight is given by $\omega(y)=\prod_{i=1}^ny_i^{a_i}$ with $a_i&gt;-1$, $y_i=\mathrm{dist}(z,\Sigma_i)$ and $\Sigma_i=\{y_i=0\}$. We prove $C^{0,\alpha}$ and $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates up to the corners formed by the intersections of two or more hyperplanes, for solutions of the conormal problem with variable coefficients. This is done by a regularization-approximation procedure, a blow-up argument and Liouville theorems. Finally, we provide smoothness of solutions when the equation is isotropic and homogeneous, and we show an application to Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities with monomial weights.</description>

      <title>Non-isoparametric Serrin domains of $\mathbb{S}^3$ with connected toric boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the overdetermined torsion problem
  $\begin{cases} -\Delta u = 1 &amp; \text{in}\ \Omega\\ u=0 &amp; \text{on}\ \partial \Omega\\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=\text{const.} &amp; \text{on}\ \partial \Omega, \end{cases}$
  where $\Omega$ is a smooth Riemannian domain. Domains admitting a solution to this problem are called \textit{Serrin domains}, after the celebrated work of Serrin \cite{Se71}, where is proved that in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such domains are geodesic balls. In the present paper we establish the existence of two distinct types of Serrin domains of $\mathbb{S}^3$, respectively of small and large volume, each of whose boundary is connected and is neither isometric to a geodesic sphere nor to a Clifford torus. These domains arise as nontrivial perturbations of some classical symmetric solutions to the same problem. Our approach relies on an implicit construction based on the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, which allows us to detect branches of non-radial solutions bifurcating from a family of radial ones. The resulting examples highlight new geometric configurations of the torsion problem in the three-dimensional sphere, providing another proof of the fact that the rigidity of Serrin-type results can fail in the presence of curvature.</description>

      <title>A novel way of computing the shape derivative for a class of non-smooth PDEs and its impact on deriving necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes of a design problem governed by a non-smooth PDE. The main particularity of the state system is the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity. We work in the framework of the functional variational approach (FVA), which has the capacity to transfer geometric optimization problems into optimal control problems, the set of admissible shapes being parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. In the FVA setting, we introduce a sensitivity analysis technique that is novel even for smooth PDEs. We emphasize that we do not resort to extensions on the hold-all domain or any kind of approximation of the original PDE. The computation of the directional derivative of the state w.r.t. functional variations results in a new way of computing the shape derivative. The presented approach allows us to handle in the objective pointwise observation and derivatives of the state on an observation set as well as distributed observation terms. In addition, we introduce the concept of locally optimal shapes and we put into evidence its connection to locally minimizers of the corresponding control problem. With directional differentiability results for the control-to-state map at our disposal, we can then state necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes in general non-smooth settings.</description>

      <title>Age-structured model of dengue transmission dynamics with time-varying parameters, and its application to Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An age structured mathematical model with time dependent parameters is developed to investigate the dynamics of dengue transmission. Its properties are thoroughly analyzed in the first part of this work, as for example its disease free steady state, the corresponding effective reproduction numbers, its basic reproduction number (obtained via the Euler and Lotka equation and the next generation matrix approach). We also provide formulas for the time-varying effective reproduction number, and draw relations with the instantaneous growth rate. In the second part, we apply this model to Brazil and use weekly time series data from this country. Various medical parameters are firstly evaluated from these data, and an extensive numerical simulations for the period 2021 to 2024 is then carried out. Estimation of the transmission rates are derived both from epidemiological data and from environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The time-varying effective reproduction numbers are then estimated on these data, following the theoretical investigations performed in the first part. The sensitive parameters that significantly affect the model dynamics are presented graphically. Model predictions for following year by using different transmission rates are finally presented. Our findings show the importance of population age distribution, vector population dynamics, and climate, contributing to a deeper understanding of dengue transmission dynamics in Brazil.</description>

      <title>Full flexibility of isometric immersions of metrics with low H\"older regularity in Poznyak theorem's dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result by Poznyak asserts that any smooth $2$-dimensional Riemannian metric $g$, posed on the closure of a simply connected domain $\omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, has a smooth isometric immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$. Using techniques of convex integration, we prove that for any $2$-dimensional $g\in\mathcal{C}^{r,\beta}$, an isometric immersion of regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\bar\omega,\mathbb{R}^4)$ for any $\alpha&lt;\min\{\frac{r+\beta}{2},1\}$, may be found arbitrarily close to any short immersion. The fact that this result's regularity reaches $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-}$ for $g\in \mathcal{C}^2$, which is referred to as "full flexibility", should be contrasted with: (i) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1/3-}$ achieved by Cao, Hirsch and Inauen for isometric immersions into $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and the lack of flexibility (rigidity) of such isometric immersions with regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1, 2/3+}$ proved by Borisov and then by Conti, de Lellis and Szekelyhidi; (ii) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-}$ obtained by K\"allen for isometric immersions into higher codimensional space; and (iii) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\frac{1}{d(d+1)/k}-}$ achieved by the author in the general case of $d$-dimensional metrics and $(d+k)$-dimensional immersions for the closely related Monge-Amp\`ere system.</description>

Abstract: The elastic properties of a material are encoded in a stiffness tensor field and the propagation of elastic waves is modeled by the elastic wave equation. We characterize analytic and algebraic properties a general anisotropic stiffness tensor field has to satisfy in order for Finsler-geometric methods to be applicable in studying inverse problems related to imaging with elastic waves.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Reconstruction of Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an intrinsic information-theoretic approach for recovering Riemannian curvature from the small-time behaviour of heat diffusion. Given a point and a two-plane in the tangent space, we compare the heat mass transported along that plane with its Euclidean counterpart using the relative entropy of finite measures. We show that the leading small-time distortion of this directional entropy encodes precisely the local curvature of the manifold. In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.
  The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $P(\Phi)_2$-model on the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. By establishing coming down from infinity for the associated stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) on the plane, we first construct a $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane as a limit of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measures on large tori. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane thus constructed, namely, we study the defocusing stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation forced by an additive space-time white noise (= the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model) on the plane. In particular, by taking a limit of the invariant Gibbs dynamics on large tori constructed by the first two authors with Gubinelli and Koch (2021), we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. Our main strategy is to develop further the ideas from a recent work on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model on the three-dimensional torus by the first two authors and Okamoto (2021), and to study convergence of the so-called enhanced Gibbs measures, for which coming down from infinity for the associated SNLH with positive regularity plays a crucial role. By combining wave and heat analysis together with ideas from optimal transport theory, we then conclude global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane and invariance of the associated Gibbs measure. As a byproduct of our argument, we also obtain invariance of the limiting $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane under the dynamics of the parabolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model.</description>

      <title>A general nonlinear characterization of stochastic incompleteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic incompleteness of a Riemannian manifold $M$ amounts to the nonconservation of probability for the heat semigroup on $M$. We show that this property is equivalent to the existence of nonnegative, nontrivial, bounded (sub)solutions to $\Delta W=\psi(W)$ for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\psi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing, with $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi&gt;0$ in $(0,+\infty)$. Similar statements hold for unsigned (sub)solutions. We also prove that stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the nonuniqueness of bounded solutions to the nonlinear parabolic equation $\partial_t u =\Delta\phi(u)$ with bounded initial data for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\phi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing and nonconstant. Such a generality allows us to deal with equations of both fast-diffusion and porous-medium type, as well as with the one-phase and two-phase classical Stefan problems, which seem to have never been investigated in the manifold setting.</description>

      <title>A Harnack inequality for solutions of elliptic-parabolic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We want to prove a Harnack type inequality for solutions of strongly degenerate parabolic, or elliptic-parabolic, equations. To do that, we first define a De Giorgi class of order $p = 2$ that contains the solutions of evolution equations of the types $\uprho (x,t) u_t + A u = 0$ and $(\uprho (x,t) u)_t + A u = 0$, where $\uprho &gt; 0$ almost everywhere and $A$ is a suitable elliptic operator. For functions belonging to this class we prove an inhomogeneous parabolic Harnack inequality, i.e. a Harnack inequality that takes into account the mean value of $\uprho$ in different regions of $\Omega \times (0,T)$. \\ As a consequence, thanks to an approximation result and a delicate passage to the limit, we are able to get a Harnack inequality for solutions, and in these cases only for solutions, of strongly degenerating parabolic equations, i.e. when $\uprho \geqslant 0$. \\ As a byproduct one obtains H\"older continuity for solutions of a subclass of the first equation (i.e. $\uprho (x,t) u_t + A u = 0$): in particular the solutions of this subclass are H\"older continuous in the interface where $\uprho$ changes its sign, from positive to zero.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a quantitative refinement of a classical symmetrisation result for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We prove that the deficit in the comparison result, established by Giarrusso and Nunziante, controls both the asymmetry of the domain and the deviation of the solution and data from radial symmetry. This yields a stability version of the Giarrusso-Nunziante inequality.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and infinite-speed propagation of solutions to models arising in porous media, when the mobility is highly degenerate (inverse power law). The approach is based on maximum principles for the fractional Laplacian, and allows to derive lower bounds on solutions in a straightforward manner. Finally, in the case of clogged porous media, where the mobility vanishes at points of unbounded density, solutions that become instantaneously bounded are constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address local- and global-in-time well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for nonlinear heat equations without imposing growth rate restrictions on the nonlinearity a priori. Our results constitute a non-trivial expansion of the classical $L^q$-theory for nonlinearities dominated by polynomial growth and the exponential-Orlicz space theory for nonlinearities of exponential growth, to one dealing with nonlinearities of arbitrarily large growth rate. A key ingredient is a new smoothing estimate for the action of the heat semigroup between two arbitrary Orlicz spaces, and in particular into $L^{\infty}$. For nonlinearities growing at least exponentially we are able to identify explicitly a critical space for local well-posedness and for small initial data global well-posedness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (HNLS) on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We obtain the sharp local well-posedness up to the critical regularity for cubic nonlinearity and in critical spaces for higher odd nonlinearities. Moreover, when the initial data is small, we prove the global existence and scattering for the solutions to HNLS with higher nonlinearities (except the cubic one) in critical Sobolev spaces. The main ingredient of the proof is the sharp up to the endpoint local/global-in-time Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Existence of transmission eigenvalues for biharmonic scattering by a clamped planar region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the so-called clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. This is a new transmission eigenvalue problem that is derived from the scattering of an impenetrable clamped obstacle in a thin elastic plate. The scattering problem is modeled by a biharmonic wave operator given by the Kirchhoff--Love infinite plate problem in the frequency domain. These scattering problems have not been studied to the extent of other models. Unlike other transmission eigenvalue problems, the problem studied here is a system of homogeneous PDEs defined in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This provides unique analytical and computational difficulties when studying the clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. We are able to prove that there exist infinitely many real clamped transmission eigenvalues. This is done by studying the equivalent variational formulation. We also investigate the relationship of the clamped transmission eigenvalues to the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the negative Laplacian for the bounded scattering obstacle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a theorem of Lair concerning the existence of positive entire large solutions to competitive semilinear elliptic systems. While Lair's original result \cite{Lair2025} was established for power-type nonlinearities, our work extends the theory to a broad class of general nonlinearities satisfying a Keller--Osserman-type growth condition. The proof follows the same conceptual framework monotone iteration to construct global positive solutions, reduction to a scalar inequality for the sum of the components, application of a Keller--Osserman transform, and a two-step radial integration argument but replaces the explicit power-law growth with a general monotone envelope function. This approach yields a unified and verifiable criterion for the existence of large solutions in terms of the Keller--Osserman integral, thereby encompassing both critical and supercritical growth regimes within a single analytical setting.</description>

Abstract: We establish new estimates for the size and structure of the nodal set $\{u=0\}$ and the singular set $\{u=|\nabla u|=0\}$ of solutions $u$ to parabolic inequalities with parabolic Lipschitz coefficients. In particular, we show that almost all of the nodal and singular sets are covered by regular parabolic Lipschitz graphs with estimates, and that both sets satisfy parabolic Minkoswki estimates depending only on a doubling quantity at a point. Many of our results are new even for the heat equation on $\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Resource Distribution in a One-Dimensional Logistic Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the optimization of resource distributions in a one-dimensional logistic diffusive model. The goal is to determine a distribution on a bounded one-dimensional domain that maximizes the total population at equilibrium. Previous works have shown that optimal resources are bang-bang, and in one dimension, a sufficiently large dispersal rate forces the optimal resource to be concentrated. For general dispersal rates, however, the analysis becomes more difficult because the equilibrium population may behave irregularly, and the optimal resource may be fragmented. To address this, we introduce a block decomposition that reduces fragmented resources to a collection of concentrated blocks. We then define an advantage function, which measures the gain in the equilibrium population obtained by allocating resources on a fixed interval and is used to analyze the contribution of each block to the total population. This function also allows us to reformulate the optimization problem as a convexity analysis of the advantage function. We prove the superlinearity of this function when the total resource is small enough, and this property leads to an explicit characterization of the optimal control with sufficiently small total resource.</description>

Abstract: We develop a fully discrete, semi-implicit mixed finite element method for approximating solutions to a class of fourth-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz and non-monotone nonlinearities, perturbed by spatially smooth multiplicative Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme is applicable to a range of physically relevant nonlinear models, including the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (sLLBar) equation, the stochastic convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with mass source, and the stochastic regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, among others. To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated problem converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated system, and we establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation. Numerical simulations are provided to support the theoretical results.</description>
