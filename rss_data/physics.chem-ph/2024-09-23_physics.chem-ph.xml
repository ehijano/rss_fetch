      <title>Spatial Signatures of Electron Correlation in Least-Squares Tensor Hyper-Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Least Squares Tensor Hypercontraction (LS-THC) has received some attention in recent years as an approach to reduce the significant computational costs of wavefunction based methods in quantum chemistry. However, previous work has demonstrated that the LS-THC factorization performs disproportionately worse in the description of wavefunction components (e.g. cluster amplitudes $\hat{T}_2$) than Hamiltonian components (e.g. electron repulsion integrals $(pq|rs)$). This work develops novel theoretical methods to study the source of these errors in the context of the real-space $\hat{T}_2$ kernel, and reports, for the first time, the existence of a "correlation feature" in the errors of the LS-THC representation of the "exchange-like" correlation energy $E_X$ and $\hat{T}_2$ that is remarkably consistent across ten molecular species, three correlated wavefunctions, and four basis sets. This correlation feature portends the existence of a "pair-point kernel" missing in the usual LS-THC representation of the wavefunction, which critically depends upon pairs of grid points situated close to atoms and with inter-pair distances between one and two Bohr radii. These findings point the way for future LS-THC developments to address these shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Networks for Prediction of Electronic Excitation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a machine learning based approach which can learn the time-dependent electronic excitation dynamics of small molecules subjected to ion irradiation. Ensembles of recurrent neural networks are trained on data generated by time-dependent density functional theory to relate atomic positions to occupations of molecular orbitals. New data is incrementally and efficiently added to the training data using an active learning process, thereby improving model accuracy. Predicted changes in orbital occupations made by the recurrent neural network ensemble are found to have errors and one standard deviation uncertainties which are two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical values of the orbital occupation numbers. The trained recurrent neural network ensembles demonstrate a limited ability to generalize to molecules not used to train the models. In such cases, the models are able to identify key qualitative features, but struggle to match the quantitative values. The machine learning procedure developed here is potentially broadly applicable and has the potential to enable study of broad ranges of both materials and dynamical processes by drastically lowering the computational cost and providing surrogate model for multiscale simulations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling High Selectivity Origin of Pt-Bi Catalysts for Alkaline Methanol Electrooxidation via CO-free pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing puzzle for methanol electrooxidation is how to achieve a CO-free pathway and accurately understand the origin of electrocatalytic selectivity. Herein, we unequivocally demonstrate that the Bi-modified Pt/C follows a CO-free dominated pathway during alkaline methanol electrooxidation, and unveil the formaldehyde (HCHO) intermediate as a critical factor influencing pathway selectivity. These findings are substantiated by kinetic isotope effects, formate Faradaic efficiency, in situ spectroscopy, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, and density functional theory calculations. Bi modification significantly increases the HCHO dehydrogenation barrier, which facilitates its desorption and subsequent conversion to the H2COOH- anion at the alkaline interface, intrinsically avoiding CO formation. More specifically, the formation of ensemble sites featuring V-shaped Bi-Pt-Bi configuration inhibits the cleavage of C-H bond, and the weak OH binding energy at Bi adatoms effectively prevents blockage of oxygenated species, allowing such ensemble sites to fulfill their functional role. Our study opens up a novel dimension for designing advanced CO-free catalysts.</description>

      <title>Scattering of CO from vacant-MoSe$_2$ with O adsorbates: is CO$_2$ formed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, based on density functional theory that also accounts for van der Waals interactions, we study the oxidation of gas phase CO on MoSe$_2$ with a Se vacancy and oxygen coverage of 0.125~ML. In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically slow cooling of hot electrons in CdSe nanocrystals compared to CdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of excited charge carriers in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) for optoelectronic technologies has been a long-standing goal in the field of nanoscience. Experimental efforts to extend the lifetime of excited carriers have therefore been a principal focus. To understand the limits of these lifetimes, in this work, we theoretically study the timescales of pure electron relaxation in negatively charged NCs composed of two prototypical materials: CdSe and CdS. We find that hot electrons in CdSe have lifetimes that are five to six orders of magnitude longer than in CdS when the relaxation is governed only by the intrinsic properties of the materials. Although these two materials are known to have somewhat different electronic structure, we elucidate how this enormous difference in lifetimes arises from relatively small quantitative differences in electronic energy gaps, phonon frequencies, and their couplings. We also highlight that the effect of the phonons on electron relaxation is dominated by a Fr\"ohlich-type mechanism in these charged systems with no holes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kink Filtration: Achieving Asymptotic Size-Independence of Path Integral Simulations Utilizing the Locality of Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. The main difficulty that still needs to be surmounted is that the scaling of the algorithms still depends upon the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. The adaptive kink filtration technique introduced here is compatible with previously introduced approaches to making path integral simulations more efficient, and can additionally be used for calculation of correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Site-site interaction model for alcohol models in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interaction site-based model of two-dimensional alcohols is proposed as a follow up of the recent SSMB site-site model for 2D water [J. Mol. Liq. 386 (2023 122475]. Computer simulation studies indicate that the model exhibits hbond-type clustering based on the same charge order feature observed in real alcohols. Hence, the equivalent of 2D mono-ols ranging from methanol to octanol were studied for their clustering properties, focusing on how the micro-structure affects the shape of the site-site pair correlation functions and structure factors, as well as the combination of the latter into the radiation scattering intensities. The major finding is the apparent contradiction between the existence of large pre-peaks in the structure factors, usually associated to the existence of clusters, and the exponential decay of the cluster distribution indicating the absence of specific clusters, contrary to the 3D case. This is resolved by realizing that the pair correlation function is an observable of the local density fluctuations, hence the pre-peak witnesses fluctuations around clustering tendencies, which are the result of charge ordering of the polar groups, and visible in the snapshots. The scattering pre-peak witnesses only fluctuations due to charge ordering, and not the clusters themselves, underlining the fact that these are labile entities. The study highlights how charge order through atomic sites is a universal feature behind the micro-structure of organized liquids, and, in the particular case of 2D liquids, a more realistic alternative to orientation based models such as the Mercedes-Benz model, for instance.</description>

      <title>Slowly Quenched, High Pressure Glassy B$_2$O$_3$ at DFT Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling inorganic glasses requires an accurate representation of interatomic interactions, large system sizes to allow for intermediate-range structural order, and slow quenching rates to eliminate kinetically trapped structural motifs. Neither first principles- nor force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations satisfy these three criteria unequivocally. Herein, we report the development of a machine learning potential (MLP) for a classic glass, B$_2$O$_3$, which meets these goals well. The MLP is trained on condensed phase configurations whose energies and forces on the atoms are obtained using periodic quantum density functional theory. Deep potential MD (DPMD) simulations based on this MLP accurately predict the equation of state and the densification of the glass with slower quenching from the melt. At ambient conditions, quenching rates larger than 10$^{11}$ K/s are shown to lead to artifacts in the structure. Pressure-dependent X-ray and neutron structure factors from the simulations compare excellently with experimental data. High-pressure simulations of the glass show varied coordination geometries of boron and oxygen, which concur with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the core-excited states of the allyl using CVS-icMRCISD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allyl radical (C3H5) is a well-characterized hydrocarbon radical, renowned for its pivotal role as an intermediate species in high-energy environments. Its core excited states can elucidate intricate details pertaining to its electronic and structural properties. The core excited states of allyl were studied experimentally using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and the primary characteristic peaks were assigned using the MCSCF approach, but not entirely. In this work, the recently developed CVS-icMRCISD scheme was used to simulate the excitation and ionization processes of C's K-shell electrons within allyl radicals, cations, and anions, respectively. Our results indicate that the XAS spectrum obtained not merely captured the distinctive peaks associated with allyl radicals, but also encompassed the characteristic peaks pertaining to allyl cations. Meanwhile, unlike manually adjusting the state weights of different electronic states to align with experimental spectral data, we adopt the CVS-icMRCISD scheme, which uses state averaging and produces unbiased results, making it suitable for studying multiple states simultaneously and easy to converge. More importantly, when accounting for the dynamic electron correlation, our results align seamlessly with the experimental XAS. This congruence underscores the potential of our CVS-icMRCISD as a robust tool for theoretical investigations pertaining to the excitation of inner shell electrons in small molecules.</description>

      <title>Combustion Toolbox: An open-source thermochemical code for gas- and condensed-phase problems involving chemical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Combustion Toolbox (CT) is a newly developed open-source thermochemical code designed to solve problems involving chemical equilibrium for both gas- and condensed-phase species. The kernel of the code is based on the theoretical framework set forth by NASA's computer program CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) while incorporating new algorithms that significantly improve both convergence rate and robustness. The thermochemical properties are computed under the ideal gas approximation using an up-to-date version of NASA's 9-coefficient polynomial fits. These fits use the Third Millennium database, which includes the available values from Active Thermochemical Tables. Combustion Toolbox is programmed in MATLAB with an object-oriented architecture composed of three main modules: CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET. The kernel module, CT-EQUIL, minimizes the Gibbs/Helmholtz free energy of the system using the technique of Lagrange multipliers combined with a multidimensional Newton-Raphson method, upon the condition that two state functions are used to define the mixture properties (e.g., enthalpy and pressure). CT-SD solves processes involving strong changes in dynamic pressure, such as steady shock and detonation waves under normal and oblique incidence angles. Finally, CT-ROCKET estimates rocket engine performance under highly idealized conditions. The new tool is equipped with a versatile Graphical User Interface and has been successfully used for teaching and research activities over the last four years. Results are in excellent agreement with CEA, Cantera within Caltech's Shock and Detonation Toolbox (SD-Toolbox), and the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA) code. CT is available under an open-source GPLv3 license via GitHub https://github.com/CombustionToolbox/combustion_toolbox, and its documentation can be found in https://combustion-toolbox-website.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of amide + amine mixtures. 3. Relative permittivities of N,N-dimethylformamide + N-propylpropan-1-amine, + N-butylbutan-1-amine, + butan-1-amine, or + hexan-1-amine systems at several temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative permittivities at 1 MHz, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$, and at (293.15-303.15) K, are reported for the binary systems N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) + N-propylpropan-1-amine (DPA), + N-butylbutan-1-amine (DBA), + butan-1-amine (BA) or + hexan-1-amine (HxA). The values of the excess relative permittivities, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$, have also been determined for these solutions. The measurements were realized by means of a precision impedance analyser 4294A, to which a 16452A cell connected using a 16048G test lead, all of them from Agilent. The $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ values are large and negative, and diminish when the size of the amine increases along a homologous series, which has been ascribed mainly to the rupture of interactions between like molecules along mixing. Calculations on excess molar orientational polarizabilities support this conclusion, indicating a dominant contribution to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ from the orientational polarizability of the molecules in the mixture. The analysis of excess relative Kirkwood correlation factors shows that the correlation between dipoles is effectively decreased along the mixing process.</description>

      <title>Orientational effects in mixtures of organic carbonates with alkanes or 1-alkanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions and structure of organic carbonate + alkane, and 1-alkanol + organic carbonate mixtures have been investigated by means of a set of molar excess functions: enthalpies, volumes, isobaric heat capacities, or entropies; and considering internal pressure, liquid-liquid equilibria or permittivity data. In addition, the mentioned systems have been studied using the Flory model and the concentration-concentration structure factor formalism. The mixtures under consideration are characterized by dipolar interactions and by homocoordination (that is, by interactions between like molecules). In systems with a given solvent, dipolar interactions are weakened in the order: propylene carbonate (PC) &gt; dimethyl carbonate (DMC) &gt; diethyl carbonate (DEC). Comparison of mixtures containing DMC or DEC with those involving 2-propanone or 3-pentanone shows that dipolar interactions are not determined merely by values of the dipole moment, but they also depend on the group size. The enthalpies of the alkanol-carbonate interactions have been evaluated from calorimetric data. They are stronger in DMC solutions and become weaker when the alcohol size increases in mixtures with a given carbonate. Application of the Flory model to 43 systems of the type 1-alkanol + carbonate provides a mean relative standard deviation for excess molar enthalpy equal to 0.107. Results reveal that orientational effects decrease in the order DEC &gt; PC &gt; DMC. Orientational effects are particularly relevant in methanol or ethanol + DEC mixtures. Interestingly, the mentioned effects are weaker in 1-alkanol + DMC mixtures than in DMC + alkane systems. A similar trend is observed in DEC solutions when the considered alcohol is longer than ethanol.</description>

      <title>Dissolution of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen monoxide in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) and nitrogen monoxide (NO) are some of the gas impurities present in the carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) separated from fume using post combustion capture process. Even in a small amount, these impurities may have an impact on storage process development. The dissolution of such gases in aqueous phase is part of the studies carried out to develop processes and analyze the risks in case of geological storage. The enthalpies of solution of SO$_2$ and NO in water were here investigated by calorimetry, using a flow calorimetric technique. The enthalpies of solution were determined at 323.15 K and 373.15 K for sulfur dioxide, and at 323.15 K for nitrogen monoxide. The experimental enthalpy data were used together with available solubility data to test thermodynamic models representative of vapor-liquid equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Electrical Response of Nanofluidic Systems Subjected to Viscosity Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is expected that the introduction of a viscosity gradient across a nanofluidic system will drastically vary its current-voltage response, $i-V$. However, to date, there is no self-consistent theoretical model that can be used to fully characterize such a system. This work provides an internally self-consistent model that details all the key characteristics of ion transport through a nanofluidic system for an arbitrary viscosity field. In particular, this work addresses three separate issues. First, we provide a new expression for the Ohmic conductance, $g_{Ohmic} = i/V$. Second, several previous theoretical studies have suggested that the introduction of a viscosity gradient can result in the shift of the $i-V$ such that it does not cross the origin. This work unequivocally shows that the $i-V$ is expected to always cross the origin. Third, we demonstrate that even without electroosmotic flows, the introduction of a viscosity gradient results in current rectification. Importantly, all theoretical results are verified by non-approximated numerical simulations. This work provides the appropriate framework to analyze and interpret experimental and numerical simulations of nanofluidic systems subject to a viscosity gradient.</description>

      <title>Learning Ordering in Crystalline Materials with Symmetry-Aware Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures. Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability, strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various orderings.</description>

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the role that LLMs play in chemistry which lead to an increased focus on the development of LLMs benchmarks tailored to chemical domains to assess the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of chemical tasks varying in type and complexity. However, existing benchmarks in this domain fail to adequately meet the specific requirements of chemical research professionals. To this end, we propose \textbf{\textit{ChemEval}}, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4 crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across 42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on ChemEval under zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, which included carefully selected demonstration examples and carefully designed prompts. The results show that while general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 excel in literature understanding and instruction following, they fall short in tasks demanding advanced chemical knowledge. Conversely, specialized LLMs exhibit enhanced chemical competencies, albeit with reduced literary comprehension. This suggests that LLMs have significant potential for enhancement when tackling sophisticated tasks in the field of chemistry. We believe our work will facilitate the exploration of their potential to drive progress in chemistry. Our benchmark and analysis will be available at {\color{blue} \url{https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/ChemEval}}.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in chromatin: mesoscopic and mean-field approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of a minimal physical model, we investigate the interplay of two phase transitions at play in chromatin organization: (1) liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within the fluid solvating chromatin, resulting in the formation of biocondensates, and (2) the coil-globule crossover of the chromatin fiber, which drives the condensation or extension of the chain. In our model, a species representing a domain of chromatin is embedded in a binary fluid. This fluid phase separates to form a droplet rich in a macromolecule (B). Chromatin particles are trapped in a harmonic potential to reproduce the coil and globular phases of an isolated polymer chain. We investigate the role of the droplet material B on the radius of gyration of this polymer and find that this radius varies nonmonotonically with respect to the volume fraction of B. This behavior is reminiscent of a phenomenon known as $\textit{co-non-solvency}$: a polymer chain in good solvent (S) may collapse when a second good solvent (here B) is added in low quantity, and expand at higher B concentration. Additionally, the presence of finite-size effects on the coil-globule transition results in a qualitatively different impact of the droplet material on polymers of various sizes. In the context of genetic regulation, our results suggest that the size of chromatin domains and the quantity of condensate proteins are key parameters to control whether chromatin may respond to an increase of the quantity of chromatin-binding proteins by condensing or expanding.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resetting for Informed Search Strategies and the Design of Non-equilibrium Steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian Transition in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects, which are further amplified by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. These phenomena serve as alternative indicators of the shift from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior. Moreover, the spectral features can act as sensitive probes for distinguishing geometric structures of the aggregates. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that for carbon monosulfide ${\rm C}\,{\rm S}$ in the Born-Oppenheimer formalism, by taking into account the RKR turning points found by Coxon and Hajigeorgiou (2023), and asymptotics at small and large internuclear distances, the potential curve $V(R)$ for the electronic ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ is constructed in full generality for the whole range of internuclear distances $R \in [0,\infty)$ with an accuracy of 3-4 significant figures. Solving two-body nuclear Schr\"odinger equation with the potential $V(R)$ the whole rovibrational spectrum for ${}^{12} {\rm C}\,{}^{32} {\rm S}$ dimer is found: the $\sim 14500$ rovibrational energy states with $L_{max}=289$ and $\nu_{max} \sim 82$ with accuracy $\sim 10^{-4}$ hartree in energy.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Large and Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a massively parallel, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the calculation of the vertical excitation energies (VEEs) and optical absorption spectra of condensed and molecular systems, starting from single-particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained with density functional theory. The algorithms adopted here enable one to circumvent the slowly converging sums over empty and occupied states and the inversion of large dielectric matrices, through a density matrix perturbation theory approach and a low-rank decomposition of the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively. In addition, we achieve computational savings by exploiting the nearsightedness of the density matrix of semiconductors and insulators, and we scale our calculations to thousands of GPUs with a hierarchical loop- and data-distribution strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by computing the VEEs of several spin defects in wide band-gap materials, and we show that supercells with up to 1000 atoms are necessary to obtain converged results. We discuss the validity of common approximations, e.g., the solution of the BSE with truncated sums over empty and occupied states. We then apply our GW-BSE implementation to a diamond lattice with 1727 atoms to study the symmetry breaking of triplet states caused by the interaction of a point defect with an extended line defect.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGA) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. The performance of MGGAs on {\em non} magnetic systems greatly improves upon that of GGAs from the lower rung. Instead, failures of MGGAs on magnetic materials are daunting and make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. This raises the question as to whether consistent improvements can be achieved for magnetism along the lines of the Jacob's ladder. Here, we present a solution from first principles: departing from the standard approach (i.e. collinear spin-DFT), we exploit the U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge symmetry of the exact functional of spin-current-DFT to access an extended set of building blocks for approximations. Crucially, this allows us to treat broken symmetry ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. For these states, we derive a collinear MGGA that performs well for prototypical magnets and make it available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

Abstract: Ultrashort pulses can excite or ionize molecules and populate coherent electronic wavepackets, inducing complex dynamics. In this work, we simulate the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics upon ionization to different electronic wavepackets of (deuterated) benzene and fluoro-benzene molecules, quantum mechanically and in full dimensionality. In fluoro-benzene, the calculations unravel both inter-state and intra-state quantum interferences that leave clear signatures of attochemistry and charge-directed dynamics in the shape of the autocorrelation function. The latter are in agreement with experimental high harmonic spectroscopy measurements of benzenes and fluoro-benzene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving phosphor photoluminescence efficiency is a key parameter to boost the performances of many optical devices. In this work, colloidal silver nanocubes, homogeneously spread on a luminescent surface, have proved to help both injecting and extracting light in and out of the photoluminescent layer and hence contributed significantly to the enhancement of the fluorescence. This approach has been applied to two materials: the well-known Y$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$:Ce yellow phosphor and an optical quartz. The emission efficiency, for sol-gel derived YAG:Ce layers, has increased of 80\% in the presence of an optimal nanoparticle density -- whereas for quartz, a weakly fluorescent material, the photoluminescence signal can be enhanced by a 200-fold factor. A physical analysis based on simulations shows that the disorder is an important factor and that the surface density of Ag nanoparticles is a crucial parameter.</description>

Abstract: We examine the potential-energy curves and polarization of the dipole moments of two static polar molecules under the influence of an external dc electric field and their anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. We model the molecules as quantum rigid rotors to take their rotational degrees of freedom into account and consider a selection of linear, symmetric, and asymmetric top molecules. We provide a comprehensive examination of the energy curves and polarization of the dipoles for varying inter-molecular separation and direction of the electric field and find that the properties of the molecules depend strongly on the field's direction at short separations, showing the importance of accounting for molecular rotation. The latter provides insight into the possible effects of accounting for rotational degrees of freedom in molecular dipolar gases.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping between molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest. This was historically accomplished via the development of descriptors which requires significant domain expertise and struggles to generalize. Thus the field has morphed into Molecular Property Prediction and been given over to learned representations which are highly generalizable. The paper introduces fastprop, a DeepQSPR framework which uses a cogent set of molecular level descriptors to meet and exceed the performance of learned representations on diverse datasets in dramatically less time. fastprop is freely available on github at github.com/JacksonBurns/fastprop.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime, which we describe as a thermodynamic system-bath model [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 234112 (2024)]. Based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle, non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials are expressed in terms of non-equilibrium extensive and intensive variables in time derivative form. This is made possible by incorporating the entropy production rate into the definitions of non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Unlike fluctuation theorem and stochastic thermodynamics theory, this theory does not require the assumption of a factorized initial condition and is valid in the full quantum regime where the system and bath are quantum mechanically entangled. Our results are numerically verified by simulating a thermostatic Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal processes and two thermostatic processes using the quantum hierarchical Fokker--Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that, from weak to strong system-bath interactions, the thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.</description>
