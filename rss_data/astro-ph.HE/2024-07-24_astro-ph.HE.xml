      <title>Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes Explains the X-Ray Weakness of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at $z&gt;4$ in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with $M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates ($1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4$) with zero spin, viewed at angles $&gt;30^\circ$ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed $2-10$ keV band reach $\sim10^4$ at $z=6$, $\sim5$ times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs exhibit $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values outside standard ranges, with X-ray weakness increasing with optical-UV luminosity; they are also extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index $\Gamma=3.1$, mode of $\Gamma=4.4$). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot ($&gt;10^8$ K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within $10^\circ$ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a $\sim1.5\%$ probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at $z\sim6$ from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains $50\%$ of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of $\sim3$. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.</description>

      <title>Radiation and outflow properties of super-Eddington accretion flows around various mass classes of black holes: Dependence on the accretion rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion flow and outflow around black holes to examine the properties of radiation and outflow as functions of the black hole mass and the accretion rate onto the black hole ($\dot M_{\rm BH}$). We find that the $\dot{m}_{\rm BH} (\equiv \dot{M}_{\rm BH}c^2 /L_{\rm Edd})$ dependence of $L_{\rm rad}/L_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm mech}/L_{\rm Edd}$ found for stellar-mass black hole can apply to the high mass cases, where $L_{\rm rad}$ is the radiation luminosity, $L_{\rm mech}$ is the mechanical luminosity, $c$ is the speed of light, and $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. Such universalities can appear in the regime, in which electron scattering opacity dominates over absorption opacity. Further, the normalized isotropic mechanical luminosity $L_{\rm mech}^{\rm ISO}/L_{\rm Edd}$ (evaluated by normalized density and velocity at $\theta=10^\circ$) exhibits a broken power-law relationship with ${\dot m}_{\rm BH}$; $L_{\rm mech}^{\rm ISO}/ L_{\rm Edd} \propto{\dot m}_{\rm BH}^{2.7}$ (or $\propto {\dot m}_{\rm BH}^{0.7}$) below (above) ${\dot m}_{\rm BH}\sim 400$. This is because the radial velocity stays nearly constant (or even decreases) below (above) the break with increase of $\dot m_{\rm BH}$. We also find that the luminosity ratio is $L_{\rm mech}/L_{\rm rad}^{\rm ISO} \sim$ 0.05 at ${\dot m}_{\rm BH} \sim 100$, which is roughly consistent with the observations of NLS1, 1H 0323+103.</description>

      <title>Extreme magnetic fields around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results of the event horizon-scale images of M87* and Sagittarius A* from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration show that strong magnetic fields are likely present around the central black holes (BHs) in these sources. Magnetically arrested disks (MADs), the end stage of magnetic flux saturation around BHs, are especially rich in horizon-scale physics due to the presence of powerful jets and magnetic flux eruptions that provide significant feedback on the accretion mechanism. Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge about the magnetic field evolution in numerical simulations of accreting BHs, focusing on jet launching, black hole-interstellar medium feedback, and black hole imaging of MADs. We find that misaligned MAD accretion flows seemingly exhibit jet ejection cycles that could produce flaring states in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei. Further, we show that advances in horizon-scale interferometric telescopes could identify disk misalignment by imaging the disk-jet connection region.</description>

      <title>Is Gamma-ray Burst 221009A Really a Once-in-10,000 Year Event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) brighter than the GRB 221009A, the brightest yet observed, have previously been estimated to occur at a rate of 1 per 10,000 years, based on the extrapolation of the distribution of fluences of the Long GRB population. We show that bursts this bright could instead have a rate as high as approximately one per 200 years if they are from a separate population of narrow-jet GRBs. This population must have a maximum redshift of about $z\approx 0.38$ in order to avoid over-producing the observed rate of fainter GRBs. We show that it will take $&gt; 100$ years to confirm this new population based on observing another GRB from it with a $\gamma$-ray detector; observing an orphan optical afterglow from this population with Vera Rubin Observatory or an orphan radio afterglow with the Square Kilometer Array will also take similarly long times to observe, and it is unclear if they could be distinguished from the standard GRB population. We show that the nearby narrow-jet population has more favorable energetics for producing ultra-high energy cosmic rays than standard GRBs. The rate of bursts in the Milky Way bright enough to cause mass extinctions of life on Earth from the narrow jet population is estimated to be approximately 1 per 500 Myr. This GRB population could make life in the Milky Way less likely, with implications for future searches for life on exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Robustness of neutron star merger simulations to changes in neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers play an important role in nuclear astrophysics: their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals carry information about the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear saturation density, and they may be one of the main sources of r-process elements in the Universe. Neutrino-matter interactions during and after merger impact the properties of these electromagnetic signals, and the relative abundances of the produced r-process elements. Existing merger simulations are however limited in their ability to realistically model neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions. Here, we perform a comparison of the impact of the use of state-of-the art two-moment or Monte-Carlo transport schemes on the outcome of merger simulations, for a single binary neutron star system with a short-lived neutron star remnant ($(5-10)\,{\rm ms}$). We also investigate the use of different reaction rates in the simulations. While the best transport schemes generally agree well on the qualitative impact of neutrinos on the system, differences in the behavior of the high-density regions can significantly impact the collapse time and the properties of the hot tidal arms in this metastable merger remnant. The chosen interaction rates, transport algorithm, as well as recent improvements by Radice et al to the two-moment algorithms can all contribute to changes at the $(10-30)\%$ level in the global properties of the merger remnant and outflows. The limitations of previous moment schemes fixed by Radice et al also appear sufficient to explain the large difference that we observed in the production of heavy-lepton neutrinos in a previous comparison of Monte-Carlo and moment schemes in the context of a low mass binary neutron star system.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Analysis of Crab Pulsar Giant Pulse Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small number of pulsars are known to emit giant pulses, single pulses much brighter than average. Among these is PSR J0534+2200, also known as the Crab pulsar, a young pulsar with high giant pulse rates. Long-term monitoring of the Crab pulsar presents an excellent opportunity to perform statistical studies of its giant pulses and the processes affecting them, potentially providing insight into the behavior of other neutron stars that emit bright single pulses. Here, we present an analysis of a set of 24,985 Crab giant pulses obtained from 88 hours of daily observations at a center frequency of 1.55 GHz by the 20-meter telescope at the Green Bank Observatory, spread over 461 days. We study the effects of refractive scintillation at higher frequencies than previous studies and compare methods of correcting for this effect. We also search for deterministic patterns seen in other single-pulse sources, possible periodicities seen in several rotating radio transients and fast radio bursts, and clustering of giant pulses like that seen in the repeating fast radio burst FRB121102.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent and energy-integrated two-moment general-relativistic neutrino transport simulations of hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16017v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two-moment based \emph{energy-dependent} and 3 variants of \emph{energy-integrated} neutrino transport general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of hypermassive neutron star. To study the impacts due to the choice of the neutrino transport schemes, we perform simulations with the same setups and input neutrino microphysics. We show that the main differences between energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino transport are found in the disk and ejecta properties, as well as in the neutrino signals. The properties of the disk surrounding the neutron star and the ejecta in energy-dependent transport are very different from the ones obtained using energy-integrated schemes. Specifically, in the energy-dependent case, the disk is more neutron-rich at early times, and becomes geometrically thicker at later times. In addition, the ejecta is more massive, and on average more neutron-rich in the energy-dependent simulations. Moreover, the average neutrino energies and luminosities are about 30\% higher. Energy-dependent neutrino transport is necessary if one wants to better model the neutrino signals and matter outflows from neutron star merger remnants via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Parametric Representations of Neutron-Star Equations of State With Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of low-dimensional parametric representations of neutron-star equations of state that include discontinuities caused by phase transitions. The accuracies of optimal piecewise-analytic and spectral representations are evaluated for equations of state having first- or second-order phase transitions with a wide range of discontinuity sizes. These results suggest that the piecewise-analytic representations of these non-smooth equations of state are convergent, while the spectral representations are not. Nevertheless, the lower-order (2 &lt;= N_parms &lt;= 7) spectral representations are found to be more accurate than the piecewise-analytic representations with the same number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.</description>

      <title>An alternative model for the orbital decay of M82 X-2: the anomalous magnetic braking of a Bp star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the first pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-2 was reported to be experiencing a rapid orbital decay at a rate of $\dot{P}=-(5.69\pm0.24)\times 10^{-8}~\rm s\,s^{-1}$ based on seven years \emph{NuSTAR} data. To account for the observed orbital-period derivative, it requires a mass transfer rate of $\sim200\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ ($\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate) from the donor star to the accreting neutron star. However, other potential models cannot be completely excluded. In this work, we propose an anomalous magnetic braking (AMB) model to interpret the detected orbital decay of M82 X-2. If the donor star is an Ap/Bp star with an anomalously strong magnetic field, the magnetic coupling between strong surface magnetic field and irradiation-driven wind from the surface of the donor star could cause an efficient angular-momentum loss, driving a rapid orbital decay observed in M82 X-2. The AMB mechanism of an Ap/Bp star with a mass of $5.0-15.0~M_{\odot}$ and a surface magnetic field of $3000-4500~\rm G$ could produce the observed $\dot{P}$ of M82 X-2. We also discuss the possibility of other alternative models including the companion star expansion and a surrounding circumbinary disk.</description>

      <title>Very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from young massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is known for its high star formation activity. At its center lies the young massive star cluster R136, providing a significant amount of the energy that makes the nebula shine so brightly at many wavelengths. Recently, young massive star clusters have been suggested to also efficiently produce high-energy cosmic rays, potentially beyond PeV energies. Here, we report the detection of very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the direction of R136 with the High Energy Stereoscopic System, achieved through a multicomponent, likelihood-based modeling of the data. This supports the hypothesis that R136 is indeed a very powerful cosmic-ray accelerator. Moreover, from the same analysis, we provide an updated measurement of the $\gamma$-ray emission from 30 Dor C, the only superbubble detected at TeV energies presently. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity above $0.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$ of both sources is $(2-3)\times 10^{35}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This exceeds by more than a factor of 2 the luminosity of HESS J1646$-$458, which is associated with the most massive young star cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-ray emission from each source is extended with a significance of $&gt;3\sigma$ and a Gaussian width of about $30\,\mathrm{pc}$. For 30 Dor C, a connection between the $\gamma$-ray emission and the nonthermal X-ray emission appears likely. Different interpretations of the $\gamma$-ray signal from R136 are discussed.</description>

      <title>Physical conditions that lead to the detection of the pair annihilation line in the BOAT GRB221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest of all time (BOAT) GRB221009A show evidence for a narrow, evolving MeV emission line. Here, we show that this line can be explained as due to pair annihilation in the prompt emission region, and that its temporal evolution is naturally explained as the high-latitude emission (emission from higher angles from the line of sight) after prompt emission is over. We consider both the high and low optical depth for pair production regimes, and find acceptable solutions, with the GRB Lorentz factor $\Gamma \approx 600$ and the emission radius $r \gtrsim 10^{16.5}$~cm. We discuss the conditions for the appearance of such a line, and show that a unique combination of high luminosity and Lorentz factor that is in a fairly narrow range are required for the line detection. This explains why such an annihilation line is rarely observed in GRBs.</description>

      <title>Recent IceCube Results: Diffuse Flux, Point Sources and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, the IceCube Collaboration reported the first observation of an astrophysical neutrino flux, with energies extending up to the PeV-scale. Over the last decade, this flux has been characterized by measurements in multiple detection channels that are complementary with respect to the sensitive energy range, flavor composition, sky coverage, and backgrounds. The origin of these neutrinos remains largely unknown. However, evidence has been found for neutrino emission from the directions of the blazar TXS 0506+056, Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. and the Galactic Plane. IceCube also has an active program of indirect dark matter searches with competitive constraints on dark matter models. In this talk, we will present recent results of the IceCube experiment, highlighting the latest diffuse flux measurements, point source searches, and dark matter analyses.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic analysis of the strongly lensed SN~Encore: Constraints on cosmic evolution of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing magnifies the light from a background source, allowing us to study these sources in detail. Here, we study the spectra of a $z = 1.95$ lensed Type Ia supernova SN~Encore for its brightest Image A, taken 39 days apart. We infer the spectral age with template matching using the supernova identification (SNID) software and find the spectra to be at 29.0 $\pm 5.0$ and 37.4 $\pm 2.8$ rest-frame days post maximum respectively, consistent with separation in the observer frame after accounting for time-dilation. Since SNe~Ia measure dark energy properties by providing relative distances between low- and high-$z$ SNe, it is important to test for evolution of spectroscopic properties. Comparing the spectra to composite low-$z$ SN~Ia spectra, we find strong evidence for similarity between the local sample of SN~Encore. The line velocities of common SN~Ia spectral lines, Si II 6355 and Ca II NIR triplet are consistent with the distribution for the low-$z$ sample as well as other lensed SNe~Ia, e.g. iPTF16geu ($z = 0.409$) and SN~H0pe ($z = 1.78$). The consistency in SN~Ia spectra across cosmic time demonstrates the utility of using SNe~Ia in the very high-$z$ universe for dark energy inference. We also find that the spectra of SN~Encore match the predictions for explosion models very well. With future large samples of lensed SNe~Ia, spectra at such late phases will be important to distinguish between different explosion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Modelling AR Sco: Generalised Particle Dynamics and Strong Radiation-Reaction Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of relativistic plasmas have become more feasible, popular, and crucial for various astrophysical sources with the availability of computational resources. The necessity for high-accuracy particle dynamics is especially highlighted in pulsar modelling due to the extreme associated electromagnetic fields and particle Lorentz factors. Including the radiation-reaction force in the particle dynamics adds even more complexity to the problem, but is crucial for such extreme astrophysical sources. We have also realised the need for such modelling concerning magnetic mirroring and particle injection models proposed for AR Sco, the first white dwarf pulsar. This paper demonstrates the benefits of using higher-order explicit numerical integrators with adaptive time step methods to solve the full particle dynamics with radiation-reaction forces included. We show that for standard test scenarios, namely various combinations of uniform $E$- and $B$-fields and a static dipole $B$-field, the schemes we use are equivalent to and in extreme field cases outperform standard symplectic integrators in accuracy. We show that the higher-order schemes have massive computational time improvements due to the adaptive time steps we implement, especially in non-uniform field scenarios and included radiation reaction where the particle gyro-radius rapidly changes. When balancing accuracy and computational time, we identified the adaptive Dormand-Prince eighth-order scheme to be ideal for our use cases. The schemes we use maintain accuracy and stability in describing the particle dynamics and we indicate how a charged particle enters radiation-reaction equilibrium and conforms to the analytic Aristotelian Electrodynamics expectations.</description>

      <title>An indirect search for dark matter with a combined analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from VERITAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature and identity of dark matter is a key goal in the physics community. In the case that TeV-scale dark matter particles decay or annihilate into standard model particles, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (greater than 100 GeV) will be present in the final state. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array that can indirectly detect VHE gamma rays in an energy range of 100 GeV to &gt; 30 TeV. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are ideal candidates in the search for dark matter due to their high dark matter content, high mass-to-light ratios, and their low gamma-ray fluxes from astrophysical processes. This study uses a legacy data set of 638 hours collected on 17 dSphs, built over 11 years with an observing strategy optimized according to the dark matter content of the targets. The study addresses a broad dark matter particle mass range, extending from 200 GeV to 30 PeV. In the absence of a detection, we set the upper limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous simulations of cataclysmic variables studied either the quiescence, or the outburst state in multiple dimensions or they simulated complete outburst cycles in one dimension using simplified models for the gravitational torques. We self-consistently simulate complete outburst cycles of normal and superoutbursts in cataclysmic variable systems in two dimensions. We study the effect of different $\alpha$ viscosity parameters, mass transfer rates, and binary mass ratios on the disk luminosities, outburst occurrence rates, and superhumps. We simulate non-isothermal, viscous accretion disks in cataclysmic variable systems using a modified version of the FARGO code with an updated equation of state and a cooling function designed to reproduce s-curve behavior. Our simulations can model complete outburst cycles using the thermal tidal instability model. We find higher superhump amplitudes and stronger gravitational torques than previous studies, resulting in better agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark photon parameters based on the very high energy observations of blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photon is a new gauge boson beyond the Standard Model as a kind of dark matter (DM) candidate. Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) interacts with electromagnetic fields via kinetic mixing, implicating an approach to give a constraint with extragalactic very high energy (VHE) sources. In this work, we attempt to constrain the kinetic mixing from the photon-dark photon scattering process in the host galaxy of blazar, the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way. The VHE photons from a blazar would pass through a dense DM spike around the supermassive black hole where the absorption from DPDM is dramatically enhanced. The kinetic mixing is constrained to be $\epsilon \sim 10^{-7}$ at a 95$\%$ confidence level with $m_{\rm D}\sim 0.03 - 1$ eV mass range from the observations of Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature equations of state of compact stars with hyperons: three-dimensional tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00484v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct tables of finite temperature equation of state (EoS) of hypernuclear matter in the range of densities, temperatures, and electron fractions that are needed for numerical simulations of supernovas, proto-neutron stars, and binary neutron star mergers and cast them in the format of {\sc CompOSE} database. The tables are extracted from a model that is based on covariant density functional (CDF) theory that includes the full $J^P=1/2^+$ baryon octet in a manner that is consistent with the current astrophysical and nuclear constraints. We employ a parameterization with three different values of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}=30$, 50 and 70 MeV and fixed skewness $Q_{\rm sat}= 400$ MeV for above saturation matter. A model for the EoS of inhomogeneous matter is matched at sub-saturation density to the high-density hypernuclear EoS. We discuss the generic features of the resulting EoS and the composition of matter as a function of density, temperature, and electron fraction. The nuclear characteristics and strangeness fraction of these models are compared to the alternatives from the literature. The integral properties of static and rapidly rotating compact stars in the limit of zero temperature are discussed and confronted with the multimessenger astrophysical constraints.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at avoided crossing near exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Donor Star Rejuvenation on Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In close binary star systems, common envelope evolution may occur after a previous phase of mass transfer. Some isolated formation channels for double neutron star binaries suggest that the donor of common envelope evolution was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer. Accretion should substantially alter the structure of the donor, particularly by steepening the density gradient at the core-envelope interface and rejuvenating the star. We study the common envelope evolution of a donor that was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer and has a rejuvenated structure. We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the common envelope evolution of a 18 $M_\odot$ supergiant with a 1.4 $M_\odot$ companion using rejuvenated and non-rejuvenated 1D stellar models for the donor. We compare the two simulations to characterize the effect of the rejuvenation on the outcome of the common envelope phase and the shape of the ejecta. We find that accounting for a previous phase of mass transfer reduces the duration of the inspiral phase by a factor of two, likely due to the different structure in the outer layers of the donor. In the rejuvenated case, the simulations show more equatorially concentrated and asymmetric ejecta, though both cases display evidence for the formation of a pressure-supported thick circumbinary disk. During the dynamical inspiral phase, the impact of rejuvenation on the unbinding of the envelope is unclear; we find that rejuvenation decreases the amount of unbound mass by 20$\%$ to 40$\%$ depending on the energy criterion used.</description>

      <title>Bulk Viscosity in Dense Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, I describe bulk viscosity as a general concept, and then focus on bulk viscosity in the dense matter present in compact objects. While this review is focused on bulk viscosity in the conditions present in neutron star mergers, I present a history of bulk viscosity research in dense matter, from its role in damping radial oscillations in neutron stars through its current applications in neutron star mergers. The majority of the chapter consists of calculations of the bulk viscosity from Urca processes in generic neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter, and then in dense matter containing muons ($npe\mu$ matter) as well. I make several approximations in these calculations to keep the focus on the concepts. More precise calculations exist in the literature, to which I refer the reader. One concept I attempt to elucidate is the thermodynamic behavior of a fluid element throughout an oscillation and how that leads to bulk-viscous dissipation. I conclude with a discussion of the recent research into the role of weak interactions and bulk viscosity in neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Gravity experiments with radio pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the first pulsar in a binary star system, the Hulse--Taylor pulsar, 50 years ago opened up an entirely new field of experimental gravity. For the first time it was possible to investigate strong-field and radiative aspects of the gravitational interaction. Continued observations of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar eventually led, among other confirmations of the predictions of general relativity (GR), to the first evidence for the reality of gravitational waves. In the meantime, many more radio pulsars have been discovered that are suitable for testing GR and its alternatives. One particularly remarkable binary system is the Double Pulsar, which has far surpassed the Hulse--Taylor pulsar in several respects. In addition, binary pulsar-white dwarf systems have been shown to be particularly suitable for testing alternative gravitational theories, as they often predict strong dipolar gravitational radiation for such asymmetric systems. A rather unique pulsar laboratory is the pulsar in a hierarchical stellar triple, that led to by far the most precise confirmation of the strong-field version of the universality of free fall. Using radio pulsars, it could be shown that additional aspects of the Strong Equivalence Principle apply to the dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies, like the local position and local Lorentz invariance of the gravitational interaction. So far, GR has passed all pulsar tests with flying colours, while at the same time many alternative gravity theories have either been strongly constrained or even falsified. New telescopes, instrumentation, timing and search algorithms promise a significant improvement of the existing tests and the discovery of (qualitatively) new, more relativistic binary systems.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help to identify the host galaxy. Since GW events directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help to study cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting EM counterparts from BNS mergers is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformations of BNS components offer insights into the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). In such cases, the tidal parameters of NSs, combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. Several efforts have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using the tidal parameters of BNSs, without EM counterparts, termed dark BNSs. Moreover, some studies have focused on the joint estimation of population and NS EoS for unbiased NS EoS estimation. However, none of the works consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. This method can well constrain the Hubble constant with as few as $5$ BNS observations using current-generation detectors. This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating the NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information.</description>

Abstract: Despite being one of the longest known classes of astrophysical transients, novae continue to present modern surprises. The Fermi-LAT discovered that many if not all novae are GeV gamma ray sources, even though theoretical models had not even considered them as a possible source class. More recently, MAGIC and H.E.S.S. detected TeV gamma rays from a nova. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the gamma rays are produced hadronically, and that the long-studied optical emission by novae is also shock-powered. If this is true, novae should emit a neutrino signal correlated with their gamma-ray and optical signals. We present the first search for neutrinos from novae. Because the neutrino energy spectrum is expected to match the gamma-ray spectrum, we use an IceCube DeepCore event selection focused on GeV-TeV neutrinos. We present results from two searches, one for neutrinos correlated with gamma-ray emission and one for neutrinos correlated with optical emission. The event selection presented here is promising for additional astrophysical transients including gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiments and hence modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars. The observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, some universal relations exist between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We study the universal relation including the stars containing exotic degrees of freedom such as heavier strange and non-strange baryons, strange quark matter in normal and superconducting phases, etc. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study the correlation of non-radial f-mode and p-mode frequencies with stellar properties. We find the f-mode frequency observes the universal relation with dimensionless tidal deformability but the p-mode frequency does not show a good correlation with stellar properties. The p-mode frequency is sensitive to the composition of the matter. We find that universal relation is also applicable for stars with exotic matter in the core of the star with several models of exotic matter.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray polarization in Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6$+$6124 with {\it IXPE}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of first ever spectro-polarimetric analyses of the Galactic ultra-luminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6$+6124$ during the 2023 outburst using quasi-simultaneous {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations. A pulsation of period $\sim 9.79$ s is detected in {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations with pulse fractions (PFs) $\sim 18\%$ ($2-8$ keV) and $\sim 28\%$ ($3-78$ keV), respectively. Energy dependent study of the pulse profiles with {\it NuSTAR} indicates an increase in PF from $\sim 27\%$ ($3-10$ keV) to $\sim 50\%$ ($40-78$ keV). Further, epoch-dependent polarimetric measurements during the decay phase of the outburst confirm the detection of significant polarization, with the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) ranging between $\sim 2 -3.1\%$ and $\sim8.6^{\circ}-10.8^{\circ}$, respectively, in the $2-8$ keV energy range. We also observe that the PD increases up to $\sim 4.8\%$ at higher energies ($\gtrsim 5$ keV) with dominating \texttt{bbodyrad} flux contribution ($1.5 \lesssim F_{\rm BB}/F_{\rm PL} \lesssim 3.4$) in the {\it IXPE} spectra. The phase-resolved polarimetric study yields PD as $\sim 1.7-3.1\%$ suggesting a marginal correlation with the pulse profiles. Moreover, the broad-band ($0.6-70$ keV) energy spectrum of combined {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations is well described by the combination of \texttt{bbodyrad} and \texttt{cutoffpl} components with seed photon temperature ($kT_{\rm bb}$) $\sim 0.86 \pm 0.03$ keV and photon index ($\Gamma$) $\sim 0.98 \pm 0.01$. With the above findings, we infer that the observed `low' PD in Swift J0243.6$+6124$ is attributed possibly due to `vacuum resonance' effect between the overheated and relatively cooler regions of the neutron star boundary layer.</description>

      <title>High angular momentum hot differentially rotating equilibrium star evolutions in conformally flat spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal flatness approximation to the Einstein equations has been successfully used in many astrophysical applications such as initial data constructions and dynamical simulations. Although it has been shown that full general relativistic strongly differentially rotating equilibrium models deviate by at most a few percent from their conformally flat counterparts, whether those conformally flat solutions remain stable has not been fully addressed. To further understand the limitations of the conformal flatness approximation, in this work, we construct spatially-conformally-flat hot hypermassive neutron stars with post-merger-like rotation laws, and perform conformally flat evolutions and analysis over dynamical timescales. We find that enforcing conformally-flat spacetime could change the equilibrium of quasi-toroidal models with high angular momentum for $J \gtrsim 9 ~G M_{\odot}^2 / c$ compared to fully general relativistic cases. In contrast, all the quasi-spherical models considered in this work remain stable even with high angular momentum $J=9~G M_{\odot}^2 / c$. Our investigation suggests that the quasi-spherical models are suitable initial data for long-lived hypermassive neutron star modeling in conformally flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Stripe 82X Data Release 3: Multiwavelength Catalog with New Spectroscopic Redshifts and Black Hole Masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg$^2$) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1297 Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of $r&lt;22$. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened ($R-K &gt; 4$, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Unlike other surveys, there is only a 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have SDSS spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the H$\beta$,MgII, H$\alpha$, and CIV emission lines. We find wide scatter in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statiscal analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize bias. We find that the AGN with the highest X-ray luminosities are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most black hole mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous ($L_{\rm 2-10 keV} &gt; 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$).</description>

Abstract: We investigate impacts of stellar rotation and magnetic fields on black hole (BH) formation and its subsequent explosive activities, by conducting axisymmetric radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of gravitational collapse of a 70 $M_\odot$ star with two-moment multi energy neutrino transport in numerical relativity. Due to its dense stellar structure, all models cannot avoid the eventual BH formation even though a strongly magnetized model experiences the so-called magnetorotational explosion prior to the BH formation. One intriguing phenomenon observed in the strongly magnetized model is the formation of a relativistic jet in the post-BH formation. The relativistic jet is the outcome of a combination of strong magnetic fields and low-density materials above the BH. The jet further enhances the explosion energy beyond $\sim10^{52}$ erg, which is well exceeding the gravitational overburden ahead of the shock. Our self-consistent supernova models demonstrate that rotating magnetized massive stars at the high-mass end of supernova progenitors could be a potential candidate of hypernova and long gamma-ray burst progenitors.</description>

      <title>Search of extended emission from HESS J1702-420 with eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HESS J1702-420 is a peculiar TeV complex with a morphology changing from a diffuse (HESS J1702-420B source) at $\lesssim 2$ TeV to point-like (HESS J1702-420A) at $\gtrsim 10$ TeV energies. The morphology and the spectral properties of HESS J1702-420 could be understood in terms of a (diffusive) hadronic or leptonic models in which the observed TeV emission arises correpondingly from proton-proton or IC-radiation of relativistic particles present in the region. In this work we perform searches of the X-ray counterpart of HESS J1702-420B source originated from the synchrotron emission of the primary or secondary relativistic electrons produced within leptonic or hadronic models. Such an emission can be extended and remain beyond the detection capabilities of a narrow-FoV instruments such as XMM-Newton. We utilise the publicly available first 6-months eROSITA dataset (DR1) fully covering selected for the analysis region of $&gt; 5^\circ$-radius around HESS J1702-420. We discuss biases connected to variable plasma temperature/neutral hydrogen column density in the region and present results based on background modelling approach. The performed analysis does not allow us to detect the extended X-ray counterpart of HESS J1702-420 of $0.07^\circ - 3^\circ$-radii sizes. The derived upper limits are significantly higher than the expected hadronic model flux of the X-ray counterpart. For the leptonic model the derived limits indicate the magnetic field in the region $B\lesssim 2\mu$G. We argue, that the further advances in the diffuse X-ray counterpart searches could be achieved either with next generation missions or Msec-long observational campaigns with currently operating instruments.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Rotational Deathline: Radio Emission from Ultra-long Period Magnetars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent detection of ultra-long period radio transients, we investigate new models of coherent radio emission via low-altitude electron-positron pair production in neutron stars beyond rotationally-powered curvature radiation deathlines. We find that plastic motion (akin to 'continental drift') and qualitatively similar thermoelectric action by temperature gradients in the crusts of slowly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars could impart mild local magnetospheric twists. Regardless of which mechanism drives twists, we find that particle acceleration initiates pair cascades across charge-starved gaps above a mild critical twist. Cascades are initiated via resonant inverse-Compton scattered photons or curvature radiation, and may produce broadband coherent radio emission. We compute the pair luminosity (maximum allowed radio luminosity) for these two channels, and derive deathlines and 'active zones' in $P-\dot{P}$ space from a variety of considerations. We find these twist-initiated pair cascades only occur for magnetar-like field strengths $B \gtrsim 10^{14}$ G and long periods: $P_{\rm RICS} \gtrsim 120 \; (T/10^{6.5} {\rm K})^{-5} \, {\rm sec}$ and $P_{\rm curv} \gtrsim 150 \; ({\rm v_{\rm pl}}/10^{3} {\, \rm cm \, yr^{-1}})^{-7/6} \, {\rm sec}$. Using a simplified geometric model, we find that plastic motion or thermoelectrically driven twists might naturally reproduce the observed luminosities, timescales, and timing signatures. We further derive 'active zones' in which rotationally-powered pair creation occurs via resonantly scattered photons, beyond standard curvature deathlines for pulsars. All cascades are generically accompanied by simultaneous (non-)thermal X-ray/UV counterparts which might be detectable with current instrumentation.</description>

Abstract: The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a multi-cycle JWST program that has taken among the deepest near-/mid-infrared images to date (down to $\sim$30 ABmag) over $\sim$25 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-S field in two sets of observations with one year of separation. This presented the first opportunity to systematically search for transients, mostly supernovae (SNe), out to $z$$&gt;$2. We found 79 SNe: 38 at $z$$&lt;$2, 23 at 2$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$3, 8 at 3$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$4, 7 at 4$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$5, and 3 with undetermined redshifts, where the redshifts are predominantly based on spectroscopic or highly reliable JADES photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. At this depth, the detection rate is $\sim$1-2 per arcmin$^2$ per year, demonstrating the power of JWST as a supernova discovery machine. We also conducted multi-band follow-up NIRCam observations of a subset of the SNe to better constrain their light curves and classify their types. Here, we present the survey, sample, search parameters, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), light curves, and classifications. Even at $z$$\geq$2, the NIRCam data quality is high enough to allow SN classification via multi-epoch light-curve fitting with confidence. The multi-epoch SN sample includes a Type Ia SN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$2.90, Type IIP SN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$3.61, and a Type Ic-BL SN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$2.845. We also found that two $z$$\sim$16 galaxy candidates from the first imaging epoch were actually transients that faded in the second epoch, illustrating the possibility that moderate/high-redshift SNe could mimic high-redshift dropout galaxies.</description>

      <title>The gravitational-wave emission from the explosion of a 15 solar mass star with rotation and magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waveform predictions from 3D simulations of explosions of non-rotating massive stars with no magnetic fields have been extensively studied. However, the impact of magnetic fields and rotation on the core-collapse supernova gravitational-wave signal is not well understood beyond the core-bounce phase. Therefore, we perform four magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the explosion of a $15\,M_{\odot}$ star with the SFHx and SFHo equations of state. All of the models start with a weak magnetic field strength of $10^{8}$\,G, and two of the models are rapidly rotating. We discuss the impact of the rotation and magnetic fields on the gravitational-wave signals. We find that the weak pre-collapse fields do not have a significant impact on the gravitational-wave signal amplitude. With rapid rotation, the f/g-mode trajectory can change in shape, and the dominant emission band becomes broader. We include the low-frequency memory component of the gravitational-wave signal from both matter motions and neutrino emission anisotropy. We show that including the gravitational waves from anisotropic neutrino emission increases the supernova detection distances for the Einstein Telescope, and would also be detectable out to Mpc distances by a moon-based gravitational-wave detector.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of wind interaction in spider systems : A step toward understanding transitional millisecond pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detected population of "spiders" has significantly grown in the past decade thanks to multiwavelength follow-up investigations of unidentified Fermi sources. These systems consist of low-mass stellar companions orbiting rotation-powered millisecond pulsars in short periods of a few hours up to day. Among them, a subset of intriguing objects called transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) has been shown to exhibit a remarkable behavior, transitioning between pulsar-binary and faint low-mass X-ray binary states over a span of a few years. Our objective is to study the interaction of stellar winds in tMSPs in order to understand their observational properties. To this end we focus on the parameter range that places the system near Roche-lobe overflow. Employing the adaptative mesh refinement (AMR) AMRVAC 2.0 code, we performed 2D hydrodynamical (HD) simulations of the interaction between the flows from both stars, accounting for the effects of gravity and orbital motion. By studying the mass loss and launch speed of the winds, we successfully recreated two phenomenologically distinct regimes: the accretion stream and the radio pulsar state. We also identified the tipping point that marks the sharp transition between these two states. In the pulsar state, we reconstructed the corresponding X-ray light curves of the system that produces the characteristic double-peak pattern of these systems. The position of the peaks is shifted due to orbital motion and the leading peak is weaker due to eclipsing by the companion. We suggest that a smaller leading peak in X-rays is indicative of a nearly edge-on system. This study highlights the importance of gravity and orbital motion in the interaction between the companion and pulsar winds. Our setup allows the study of the complex interaction between the pulsar wind and an accretion stream during mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Multifaceted GRB 200613A: Prompt Emission Dynamics, Afterglow Evolution, and the Host Galaxy's Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our optical observations and multi-wavelength analysis of the GRB\,200613A detected by \texttt{Fermi} satellite. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the data generally favor the Band+Blackbody (short as BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and constant interstellar medium (ISM). Model fitting yields the following parameters: $E_{K,iso} = (2.04^{+11.8}_{-1.50})\times 10^{53}$ erg, $\Gamma_0=354^{+578}_{-217}$, $p=2.09^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, $n_{18}=(2.04^{+9.71}_{-1.87})\times 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$, $\theta_j=24.0^{+6.50}_{-5.54}$ degree, $\epsilon_e=1.66^{+4.09}_{-1.39})\times 10^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_B=(7.76^{+48.5}_{-5.9})\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, we employed the public Python package \texttt{Prospector} perform a spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the host galaxy is a massive galaxy ($\log(M_\ast / M_\odot)=11.75^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$) with moderate star formation rate ($\mbox{SFR}=22.58^{+13.63}_{-7.22} M_{\odot}$/yr). This SFR is consistent with the SFR of $\sim 34.2 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from the [OII] emission line in the observed spectrum.</description>

      <title>True Pair-instability Supernova Descendant: Implications for the First Stars' Mass Distribution</title>

Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of the first Pop III stars remains a persistent mystery. Their predicted massive nature implies the existence of stars exploding as pair-instability supernovae (PISN), but no observational evidence had been found. Now, the LAMOST survey claims to have discovered a pure PISN descendant, J1010+2358, at ${\rm [Fe/H]}= -2.4$. Here we confirm that a massive 250-260 ${\rm M_\odot}$ PISN is needed to reproduce the abundance pattern of J1010+2358. However, the PISN contribution can be as low as 10%, since key elements are missing to discriminate between scenarios. We investigate the implications of this discovery for the Pop III IMF, by statistical comparison with the predictions of our cosmological galaxy formation model, NEFERTITI. First, we show that the non-detection of mono-enriched PISN descendants at ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-2.5$ allows us to exclude: (i) a flat IMF at a 90% confidence level; and (ii) a Larson type IMF with characteristic mass $m_{\rm ch}/{\rm M_\odot} &gt; 191.16x - 132.44$, where x is the slope, at a 75% confidence level. Secondly, we show that if J1010+2358 has only inherited &lt;70% of its metals from a massive PISN, no further constraints can be put on the Pop III IMF. If, instead, J1010+2358 will be confirmed to be a nearly pure (&gt;90%) PISN descendant, it will offer strong and complementary constraints on the Pop III IMF, excluding the steepest and bottom-heaviest IMFs: $m_{\rm ch}/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 143.21x - 225.94$. Our work shows that even a single detection of a pure PISN descendant can be crucial to our understanding of the mass distribution of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Line Searches with the Cherenkov Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monochromatic gamma-ray signals constitute a potential smoking gun signature for annihilating or decaying dark matter particles that could relatively easily be distinguished from astrophysical or instrumental backgrounds. We provide an updated assessment of the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to such signals, based on observations of the Galactic centre region as well as of selected dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We find that current limits and detection prospects for dark matter masses above 300 GeV will be significantly improved, by up to an order of magnitude in the multi-TeV range. This demonstrates that CTA will set a new standard for gamma-ray astronomy also in this respect, as the world's largest and most sensitive high-energy gamma-ray observatory, in particular due to its exquisite energy resolution at TeV energies and the adopted observational strategy focussing on regions with large dark matter densities. Throughout our analysis, we use up-to-date instrument response functions, and we thoroughly model the effect of instrumental systematic uncertainties in our statistical treatment. We further present results for other potential signatures with sharp spectral features, e.g.~box-shaped spectra, that would likewise very clearly point to a particle dark matter origin.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>A Model of the Response of Surface Detectors to Extensive Air Showers Based on Shower Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full model of surface-detector responses to extensive air showers. The model is motivated by the principles of air-shower universality and can be applied to different types of surface detectors. Here we describe a parametrization for both water-Cerenkov detectors and scintillator surface detectors, as for instance employed by the upgraded detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Using surface detector data, the model can be used to reconstruct with reasonable precision shower observables such as the depth of the shower maximum $X_\text{max}$ and the number of muons $R_\mu$.</description>
