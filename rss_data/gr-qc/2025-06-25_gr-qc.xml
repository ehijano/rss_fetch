      <title>Gravitational Baryogenesis Constraints on Nojiri-Odintsov $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on exploring the imbalance between matter and antimatter via the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism within the framework of Nojiri-Odintsov $f(R)$ gravity models in a spatially flat FLRW universe, where $R$ is the Ricci curvature scalar. This mechanism is based on \(\mathcal{CP}\)-violation generated via introducing an interaction between baryonic matter current (\(J^\mu\)) and the derivative of curvature scalar (\(\partial_\mu R\)), which finally results in the baryon asymmetry. We examine three distinct $f(R)$ models: (i) \(f(R)=\frac{-\alpha}{R^m}+\frac{R}{2k^2}+\beta R^2\), (ii) \(f(R)=\alpha R^{\gamma} +\beta R^{\delta}\) and (iii) \(f(R)=\frac{\alpha R^{2m}-\beta R^m}{1+\gamma R^m} \). We demonstrate that even during the matter-dominated epoch of the universe, the $f(R)$ gravity models under consideration can yield a non-vanishing matter-antimatter asymmetry. We constrain the model parameters of each model within the scenario of gravitational baryogenesis to produce the observed value of the baryon-to-entropy ratio, providing a continuous set of acceptable physical values for those parameters. Our results show highly consistent agreement to the baryon-to-entropy ratio with the observational bound from the cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Analysis of $f(R, \Sigma, T)$ Gravity with EoS Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive cosmological analysis within the framework of $f(R, \Sigma, T)$ gravity, a modified theory that incorporates nonlinear matter-geometry coupling via the inclusion of both the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$ and the scalar $\Sigma = T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. We consider a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe and introduce a linear parameterization for the equation of state (EoS) parameter based on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form, which allows us to explore the dynamical evolution of dark energy without imposing restrictive assumptions. To confront the theoretical model with observations, we utilize the latest Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers. The model parameters are constrained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations with the \texttt{emcee} package, leading to tight bounds on the parameters. The analysis reveals that the model remains consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario while allowing mild deviations consistent with observational data. Furthermore, we examine the physical and kinematical features of the model by studying the behavior of the physical parameters. Finally, the calculated age of the universe within this framework is found to be in excellent agreement with Planck 2018 results, highlighting the and viability of $f(R, \Sigma, T)$ gravity as a candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium models of Weyssenhoff spin fluid accretion tori around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of equilibrium models of accretion disks around compact objects has become a highly relevant topic in the recent times, thanks to the current understanding that indicates a direct relationship between these objects with the electromagnetic emission of supermassive compact objects residing at center of the galaxies M87 and Milky Way, both observed by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. As the physical properties of the compact sources are estimated using the results of computer simulations of the system comprising of the disk plus the compact object, adding new physical ingredients to the initial data of the simulation is pertinent to enhance our knowledge about these objects. In this work, we thus present equilibrium solutions of geometrically thick, non-self-gravitating, constant orbital specific angular momentum, neutral Weyssenhoff spin fluid accretion tori in the Kerr spacetime, building upon a previous work that was restricted to the Schwarzschild geometry. Our models are obtained under the assumptions of stationarity and axisymmetry in the fluid quantities, circularity of the flow and a polytropic equation of state. We study how the deviations from an ideal no-spin fluid depend on both the magnitude of the macroscopic spin of the fluid and on the spin parameter of the Kerr black hole, carefully encompassing both the co-rotating and the counter-rotating cases. Our results demonstrate that the characterstic radii, the thickness and the radial extent of such a torus can change importantly in the presence of the macroscopic spin of the ideal fluid. We also find some limitations of our approach that constraint the amount of spin the fluid can have in the rotating Kerr background. Finally, we present a parameter space exploration that gives us additional constraints on the possible values of the fluid spin denoted by the parameter $s_0$.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Holes Immersed in Born-Infeld Magnetic Fields and Their Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of Born-Infeld (BI) nonlinear electrodynamics on magnetic field configurations, photon orbits, and black hole shadows for Schwarzschild black holes immersed in magnetic fields. Assuming that the BI magnetic fields are asymptotically uniform and aligned with the polar axis, we solve the nonlinear magnetic field equations numerically using pseudospectral methods. Our analysis shows that nonlinear electromagnetic effects become prominent near the event horizon, particularly in the polar regions, where the magnetic field strength is significantly enhanced. This enhancement leads to closed photon orbits on the meridional plane becoming prolate, with noticeable stretching along the polar axis. Simulations of black hole images reveal that, at high observer inclinations, the shadow, which is circular in the Maxwell limit, becomes increasingly elongated along the polar direction as the nonlinear effects increase.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal correlations for semiclassical states in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-point correlation function of the area operator for semiclassical states of loop quantum gravity in the limit of large spins. The cases of intrinsic and extrinsic coherent states are considered, along with a new class of semiclassical states constructed as perturbations of Livine-Speziale coherent states. For the usual coherent states, the correlations are shown to be short-ranged, decaying exponentially with the distance. Introducing perturbations given by correlated elementary excitations and decays of the gravitational field along pairs of loops, we obtain new states that, while preserving the peakedness properties of the unperturbed states, can also display long-ranged correlations. The perturbed coherent states include examples reproducing the typical decay of correlations for quantum fluctuations of the geometry associated with free gravitons on a background metric. Such a behavior is a natural requirement for the compatibility of semiclassical states in quantum gravity with the physical regime pictured by perturbative quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>LQG inspired spacetimes as solutions of the Einstein equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black bounces are compact objects with a wormhole structure hidden behind an event horizon. This type of metric can be obtained through general relativity by considering the presence of exotic matter. Such spacetimes can also arise within the framework of effective theories inspired by loop quantum gravity. In this work, we verify the possibility of obtaining black bounce models inspired by loop quantum gravity as solutions of general relativity. For this, we examine which sources can generate these solutions and the consequences of using these types of sources. We find that the sources can be expressed as a combination of a phantom scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics. Once we obtain the sources in terms of fields, we analyze the energy conditions for each field separately to verify which of the fields is responsible for the violation of the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Marginally stable Schwarzschild-black-hole-non-minimally-coupled-Proca-field bound-state configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed that, in curved black-hole spacetimes, non-minimally coupled massive Proca fields may be characterized by the existence of poles in their linearized perturbation equations and may therefore develop exponentially growing instabilities. Interestingly, recent numerical computations [H. W. Chiang, S. Garcia-Saenz, and A. Sang, arXiv:2504.04779] have provided compelling evidence that the onset of monopole instabilities in the composed black-hole-field system is controlled by the dimensionless physical parameter $\mu r_-$, where $\mu$ is the proper mass of the non-minimally coupled Proca field and $r_-\equiv (-2\alpha)^{1/3}r_{\text{H}}$ is the radial location of the pole [here $\alpha$ is the non-minimal coupling parameter of the Einstein-Proca theory and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the radius of the black-hole horizon]. In the present paper we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical properties of critical (marginally-stable) composed Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field configurations. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact analytical formula for the discrete spectrum $\{\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n) \}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$ of Proca field masses which characterize the critical black-hole-monopole-Proca-field configurations in the dimensionless regime ${{r_- -r_{\text{H}}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\ll1$ of near-horizon poles. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonance spectrum stems from the fact that the critical field mass $\mu_{\text{c}}\equiv\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n=1)$ marks the onset of instabilities in the Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field system. In particular, composed black-hole-linearized-Proca-field configurations in the small-mass regime $\mu\leq\mu_{\text{c}}$ of the Proca field are stable.</description>

      <title>A Fog Over the Cosmological SGWB: Unresolved Massive Black Hole Binaries in the LISA Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling the rich astrophysical structure of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from its cosmological component is essential for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to access the physics of the early Universe beyond the reach of any other probe. In this work, we develop an analytical framework to compute the astrophysical contribution to the SGWB arising from an unresolved ensemble of inspiraling and merging black hole binaries. Accounting for various resolvability thresholds, we leverage this framework to predict the amplitude, spectral shape, and detection signal-to-noise ratio of the unresolved background from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), capturing the possible diversity of its SGWB imprint across a range of astrophysically motivated populations. Through a joint analysis of astrophysical and primordial contributions to the SGWB, we determine the minimum detectable amplitude of the cosmological background across a range of spectral shapes. We demonstrate that, even under optimistic subtraction thresholds, unresolved MBHBs can degrade the detectability of a cosmological signal by multiple orders of magnitude, depending on the spectral shape of the primordial component. Ultimately, the MBHB-induced astrophysical SGWB acts both as a veil and a lens: it imposes a fundamental limit on cosmological sensitivity, yet simultaneously reveals the hidden population of massive black holes beyond the reach of individual detections. Accurate modeling of this late-Universe background is therefore a prerequisite for robust component separation and for realizing LISA's full scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Validating Sequential Monte Carlo for Gravitational-Wave Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling (NS) is the preferred stochastic sampling algorithm for gravitational-wave inference for compact binary coalenscences (CBCs). It can handle the complex nature of the gravitational-wave likelihood surface and provides an estimate of the Bayesian model evidence. However, there is another class of algorithms that meets the same requirements but has not been used for gravitational-wave analyses: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an extension of importance sampling that maps samples from an initial density to a target density via a series of intermediate densities. In this work, we validate a type of SMC algorithm, called persistent sampling (PS), for gravitational-wave inference. We consider a range of different scenarios including binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) and real and simulated data and show that PS produces results that are consistent with NS whilst being, on average, 2 times more efficient and 2.74 times faster. This demonstrates that PS is a viable alternative to NS that should be considered for future gravitational-wave analyses.</description>

      <title>Tails from the Bulk: Gravitational Decay in AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS black holes in $d = 5$ and identify a regime of late-time power-law decay for smooth initial data. Based on an analysis of the quasinormal mode spectrum, we predict and characterise this decay behaviour. We perform fully nonlinear numerical evolutions with long integration times that support the prediction and exhibit no signs of instability. Remarkably, the decay is modulated by a universal oscillatory pattern, consistent with subleading corrections from a large-angular-momentum (eikonal) analysis of the quasinormal mode spectrum.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers I: Post-merger Remnant and Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the code GR-Athena++. We investigate how a different initial magnetic field configuration, nuclear equation of state, or binary mass ratio affects the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution of the post-merger remnant and disk. We also analyze the impact of the commonly-assumed reflection (bitant) symmetry across the equatorial plane. Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Crosses the Line: Quantifying and Testing the Evidence for Phantom Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinations of the most recent CMB, BAO, and SNeIa datasets, when analyzed using the CPL parametrization, $w(a) = w_0 + (1 - a) w_a$, exclude $\Lambda$CDM at $\gtrsim\!3\sigma$ in favor of a dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter that crosses the phantom divide. We confirm this behavior and show that it persists when DESI BAO data are replaced by SH0ES $H_0$ measurements, despite the known tension between these probes in the presence of CMB data. In both cases, the constraints favor a transition from an early-time phantom-like phase to a late-time quintessence-like phase, with the crossing occurring at different redshifts depending on the dataset combination. The probability that a phantom divide line (PDL) crossing does not occur within the expansion history is excluded at significance levels ranging between $3.1\sigma$-$5.2\sigma$. To investigate whether the apparent PDL crossing is a genuine feature preferred by the data or an artifact of the linear form of the CPL parametrization, we isolate the PDL crossing feature by introducing two modified versions of CPL that explicitly forbid it: CPL${}_{&gt;a_\mathrm{c}}$ and CPL${}_{&lt;a_\mathrm{c}}$. These models are physically motivated in that they phenomenologically capture the behavior of thawing and freezing scalar field scenarios. While previous studies have primarily considered thawing quintessence as a non-crossing alternative, we find that a freezing phantom-like model is the only one capable of performing comparably to CPL -- and only in a few cases. Nevertheless, across all dataset combinations considered, the standard CPL model consistently provides the best fit, strongly indicating that the data genuinely favor a PDL crossing.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Unified Field Theory of Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.</description>

      <title>A Fast Bayesian Method for Coherent Gravitational Wave Searches with Relative Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using relative stellar astrometry for the detection of coherent gravitational wave sources is a promising method for the microhertz range, where no dedicated detectors currently exist. Compared to other gravitational wave detection techniques, astrometry operates in an extreme high-baseline-number and low-SNR-per-baseline limit, which leads to computational difficulties when using conventional Bayesian search techniques. We extend a technique for efficiently searching pulsar timing array datasets through the precomputation of inner products in the Bayesian likelihood, showing that it is applicable to astrometric datasets. Using this technique, we are able to reduce the total dataset size by up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while remaining accurate to within 1% over two orders of magnitude in gravitational wave frequency. Applying this technique to simulated astrometric datasets for the Kepler Space Telescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope missions, we obtain forecasts for the sensitivity of these missions to coherent gravitational waves. Due to the low angular sky coverage of astrometric baselines, we find that coherent gravitational wave sources are poorly localized on the sky. Despite this, from $10^{-8}$ Hz to $10^{-6}$ Hz, we find that Roman is sensitive to coherent gravitational waves with an instantaneous strain above $h_0 \simeq 10^{-11.4}$, and Kepler is sensitive to strains above $h_0 \simeq $ $10^{-12.4}$. At this strain, we can detect a source with a frequency of $10^{-7}$ Hz and a chirp mass of $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3.6 Mpc for Kepler, and 0.3 Mpc for Roman.</description>

      <title>Building multi-BTZ black holes through Riemann-Hilbert problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a recently found class of non-BPS black hole solutions with asymptotically $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ in type IIB supergravity, consisting of multiple BTZ black holes localized on an $S^3$, within the group theoretical framework of Breitenlohner and Maison (BM). Starting with the multi-neutral black string solution as a seed, we solve the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem for the BM linear system. First, we determine the monodromy matrix corresponding to this seed solution by generalizing the early work of Katsimpouri et al. on the four-charged black hole of STU supergravity, where some assumptions must be relaxed for the solutions with multiple horizons. By applying the Harrison transformation, a charge-generating transformation in the $SO(4,4)$ group, to the monodromy matrix, we obtain the multi-charged black string solution. Furthermore, through a ``subtraction'' procedure -- an $SO(4,4)$ transformation that changes the asymptotic structure from $R^{1,4}\times S^1\times T^4$ to $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ spacetime -- we derive the multi-BTZ black hole solution. This is the first example in which the subtraction procedure is applied to multiple black holes, and it may also have potential applications to other cases.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>

      <title>Interior structure of the holographic s + p superconductor and chaotic-stable transition near the black hole singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interior structure of a holographic multi-band superconductor with the coexistence of s-wave and p-wave order parameters. Especially, we investigate the singularity structure of this multi-band model. Different from the single p-wave case, the alternation rule is jointly determined by parameters involving both s-wave order and p-wave order. In the coexistence region, we derive the Kasner alternation laws from both analytical and numerical methods which fit each other nicely. Furthermore, we find that the occurrence of the s-wave order parameter will lead to a chaotic-stable transition for the near singularity structure which matches the expectation of cosmological billiard approach. This novel transition for the near singularity structure constitutes a holographic counterpart of the secondary condensation in boundary superconducting system, offering a complementary perspective for characterizing the properties of boundary condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: We extend the arguments of Maldacena and N\'u\~nez to include higher co-dimension brane setups and derive a new no-go theorem. Specifically, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the energy-momentum conservation and the bulk curvature, co-dimension-two branes fail to support stable de Sitter solutions. For co-dimensions higher than two embedded in a compact internal space, we show that negative tension sources would be required. This result places strong constraints on the viability of higher-dimensional braneworld models as a means to obtain de Sitter space within string theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete spacetimes with Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer the potential for significant computational advantages; however, in many cases, it remains unclear how these advantages can be practically realized. Causal Set Theory is a discrete, Lorentz-invariant approach to quantum gravity which may be well positioned to benefit from quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm that investigates the dynamics of causal sets by sampling the space of causal sets, improving on classical methods. Our approach builds on the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo technique developed by Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282 (2023)], adapting it to sample from the constrained spaces required for application. This is done by adding a constraint term to the Hamiltonian of the system. A qubit Hamiltonian representing the Benincasa-Dowker action (the causal set equivalent of the Einstein-Hilbert action) is also derived and used in the algorithm as the problem Hamiltonian. We achieve a super-quadratic quantum scaling advantage and, under some conditions, demonstrate a greater potential compared to classical approaches than previously observed in unconstrained QeMCMC implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts $\sim 0.7-2.5$: Not Dark Energy Source but Remanants of Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an ensemble of boundary CFTs within the framework of a tensor model recently constructed to model 3d quantum gravity. The incorporation of CFT borders introduces new elements to the gravity theory. In particular, it leads to an open-closed extension of Virasoro TQFT, which in the classical limit gives rise to 3d gravity with tensionful end-of-the-world branes. It also provides predictions for off-shell manifolds with bordered asymptotic boundaries, such as the annulus wormhole. As an application, we construct a purely open variant of the tensor model to study a purely open bootstrap problem in the context of CFT triangulation. We also briefly discuss the extension to non-orientable CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.04318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $d$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole surrounded by a static anisotropic quintessence field within the framework of Rastall theory. The solution is characterized by several parameters including its mass ($M$), field structure parameter ($N_s$), Rastall coupling parameter ($\psi$), and the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). Our objective here is to identify the $d$-dimensional black holes within the framework of Rastall theory, exploring special cases, e.g., a cosmological constant, dust, radiation, and quintessence fields. In addition to this, we derive the effective equation of state parameter, denoted as $\omega_{eff}$. Next, we investigate the thermodynamics for $P$-$V$ criticality and phase transitions in the extended phase space of black hole thermodynamics. For a specific set of values for the Rastall coupling parameter, we numerically plot isothermal and isobaric curves in the reduced parameter space. We also compute the specific heat at constant pressure ($C_P$ ), volume expansion coefficient ($\alpha$), and isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_T$) to deepen our understanding of the analogy between the thermodynamics of Rastall AdS black holes and that of a liquid-gas system. Our investigations indicate that the dimension of spacetime and the Rastall coupling parameter significantly influence the critical nature of phase transitions. By utilizing the expressions for $C_P$, $\alpha$, and $\kappa_T$, we derive the Ehrenfest equations and perform an analytical investigation of phase transitions at their critical points. These results allow us to compare the thermodynamics of AdS black holes with liquid-gas systems, which closely mimics the behavior of van der Waals (vdWs) gases.</description>

Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg Black Holes with Thermal Fluctuations and Nonlinear Electromagnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work mainly focuses on the nonlinear Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg theory and its applications from various aspects. Firstly, thermodynamic variables are analytically determined via Smarr formula for a four dimensional spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole by taking the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy as the basis. The results are supported by graphical illustrations for certain Euler-Heisenberg and electric charge parameters, which are in turn used for making further comments on the stability and possible critical points of the concerned black hole. The thermodynamic analyses are then repeated for two distinct cases in which entropy is subject to a logarithmic and an exponential correction, respectively. Our assessments have shown that statistical quantum fluctuations and nonlinear electrodynamic effects can alter the stability and the thermodynamic properties of black holes. Finally, the one-sided bending angle and the gravitational redshift of light are determined in the vicinity of astronomical structures obeying the nonlinear Einstein- Euler-Heisenberg model and the results obtained are applied to three electrically charged, compact stars.</description>

      <title>Testing black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter environment using quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research explores the quasinormal modes (QNMs) characteristics of charged black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) environment. Based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the M87* black hole shadow, we implemented necessary constraints on the parameter space($a/M$,$\lambda/M$).We found that for lower values of the magnetic charge parameter, the effective range of the PFDM parameter is approximately between -0.2 and 0, while as the magnetic charge parameter increases, this effective range gradually extends toward more negative values. Then through sixth-order WKB method and time-domain method, we systematically analyzed the quasinormal oscillation spectra under scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. The results reveal that: the magnetic charge $a$ and PFDM parameters $\lambda$ modulate the effective potential barrier of black hole spacetime, profoundly influencing the response frequency and energy dissipation characteristics of external perturbations. The consistently negative imaginary part of QNMs across the entire physical parameter domain substantiates the dynamical stability of the investigated system. Moreover, we discovered differences in the parameter variation sensitivity between scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations, providing a theoretical basis for distinguishing different field disturbances. These results not only unveil the modulation mechanisms of electromagnetic interactions and dark matter distribution on black hole spacetime structures but also offer potential observational evidence for future gravitational wave detection and black hole environment identification.</description>

      <title>Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anticipation of future multi-frequency observations of black hole with the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), we construct spectral images of a thin accretion disk around a spherically symmetric black hole immersed in cold, non-magnetized, pressureless plasma. The radiation from the disk is assumed to be thermal, and the surrounding plasma is entrained by its rotation. We use the general relativistic transport equation for the radiation in the plasma, accounting for both dispersion and plasma motion but neglecting absorption. Shadow images and intensity maps are computed across the full spectrum for an inverse power-law plasma density profile. The results show a strong dependence of the observed images on the radiation frequency, which looks promising for the possibility of extracting new information in future observations of the ngEHT.</description>

      <title>Spin-induced Scalarized Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct spin-induced scalarized black hole solutions in a class of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models, where a scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field. Our results show that scalar hair develops only for rapidly rotating black holes, while slowly spinning ones remain well described by the Kerr-Newman (KN) metric. The scalar field contributes only a small fraction of the total mass, indicating suppressed nonlinear effects. This suppression may account for the narrow existence domains of scalarized black holes and the similarities observed in their existence domains across different coupling functions. Moreover, scalarized black holes are found to coexist with linearly stable, entropically favored KN black holes. These results motivate further investigations into the nonlinear dynamics and stability of scalarized black holes in these models.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional charged black holes in $f({Q})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new exact charged black hole solutions in (2+1) dimensions within the framework of $f({Q})$ gravity, where ${Q}$ denotes the non-metricity scalar. By considering a cubic $f({Q})$ form we derive classes of charged and uncharged spherically symmetric solutions, and we identify conditions under which these reduce to the well-known Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. Notably, our analysis reveals a novel charged solution that is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) but cannot be continuously deformed into a GR counterpart, and thus arising purely from the
  higher-order nature of the non-metricity corrections. Furthermore, we explore the geometrical properties of the solutions, demonstrating the existence of multiple horizons and a softer central singularity compared to GR. Additionally, we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, such as Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, with results confirming thermal stability. Finally, a detailed study of the geodesic motion and the effective potentials unveils stable photon orbits, as well as the effect of cubic non-metricity corrections on orbital dynamics.</description>

      <title>Black holes in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of black holes coupled with the Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electromagnetic field in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The black hole solutions for electrically charged, magnetically charged and the dyonic case are separately analyzed, and we discuss the scalar curvature and the energy conditions of the black hole spacetime. In the magnetic charge solution, the $f(R,T)$ correction appears in the $1/r^6$ Euler-Heisenberg electromagnetic field correction term, while the electrically charged solution includes an $r^2$ term, with the curvature of the spacetime determined by the $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter. The dyonic solution is obtained through vacuum polarization quantum electrodynamics corrections, where electromagnetic duality is broken and the solution exists higher-order correction terms. The relationship between the event horizon and charge of dyonic extreme black holes is studied. Furthermore, we investigate the effective metric, photon trajectories, and innermost stable circular orbit under nonlinear electromagnetic effects, providing images of photon geodesic for varying electric and magnetic charge strengths and $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Static Spherical Vacuum Solution to Bumblebee Gravity with Time-like VEVs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field \(B_\mu\) has a time-like vacuum expectation value \(b_\mu\) is studied. We show that in general curved space-time solutions are not allowed and only the Minkowski space-time exists. However, it is surprising that non-trivial solutions can be obtained so long as a unique condition for the vacuum expectation \(b^2\equiv -b^\mu b_\mu=2/\kappa\), where \(\kappa=8\pi G\), is satisfied. We argue that naturally these solutions are not stable since quantum corrections would invalidate the likely numerical coincidence, unless there are some unknown fine-tuning mechanisms preventing any deviation from this condition. Nevertheless, some properties of these novel but peculiar solutions are discussed, and we show that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m solution is a limit of one of our solutions.</description>

Abstract: We pave the way for future gravitational-wave detection experiments, such as the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO, to constrain dark sectors made of SU(N) Yang-Mills confined theories. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by combining first principle lattice results and effective field theory approaches to infer essential information about the non-perturbative dark deconfinement phase transition driving the generation of gravitational-waves in the early universe, such as the order, duration and energy budget of the phase transition which are essential in establishing the strength of the resulting gravitational-wave signal.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Oscillons in Scalar-Tensor Theories: The Higgs-like case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the post-inflationary evolution of a non-minimally coupled inflaton field in scalar-tensor theories, framed within the flexible framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. By focusing on a class of simplified Higgs-like scenarios, we simulate the transition from the end of inflation to the formation of oscillons using fully-fledged 3+1 classical lattice simulations. Once oscillons form, we extract their profiles and perform 1+1 simulations to evolve their radial equations. Our findings reveal that these oscillons, unlike typical cases in the literature, are relatively short-lived, due to the presence of self interactions at small field values. The radiation produced by this novel type of oscillons can quickly lead to a radiation-dominated Universe, even in the absence of additional fields or interactions. Finally, we leverage our results to derive precise predictions for the inflationary observables and the produced spectrum of gravitational waves associated with oscillon formation. Significantly, our study establishes also an upper bound on the duration of the heating phase in Einstein-Cartan Higgs inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Constraints on Extended Cosmological Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\ln k = 0.0062 \pm 0.0052$) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\rm eff} = 2.86 \pm 0.13$, which combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\rm eff} = 2.89 \pm 0.11$), for non-zero neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation ($N_{\rm idr} &lt; 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ Carroll gravity: asymptotic symmetries and C-thermal configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of three-dimensional Carroll gravity with negative cosmological constant is studied. We formulate a consistent set of boundary conditions preserved by an infinite-dimensional extension of the AdS$_3$ Carroll algebra, which turns out to be isomorphic to a precise generalized BMS$_3$ algebra. This is described by four independent functions of the circle at infinity, generating spatial superrotations, Carroll superboosts, spatial supertranslations and time supertranslations. Remarkably, this asymptotic symmetry algebra contains as subalgebras to BMS$_3$ (generated by spatial superrotations and time supertranslations) and the two-dimensional conformal algebra (spanned by spatial superrotations and spatial supertranslations). We also introduce a new solution - endowed with a Carroll extremal surface - that fulfills this set of asymptotic conditions. By taking advantage of the Chern-Simons formulation of the theory, Carroll thermal properties, obtained from regularity conditions, and entropy of the configuration are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Competing Bosonic Reactions: Insight from Exactly Solvable Time-Dependent Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness of the Black String with small circle size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study uniqueness of the Black String, i.e. the product of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild space with a circle of length L.
  In arXiv:2410.20967, this was reduced to a non-linear elliptic PDE, and we use this setup to show that for small L the Black String is infinitesimally rigid as a Ricci-flat metric.
  Using a fixed point theorem, we prove that this implies local uniqueness, i.e. there exist no other Ricci-flat metrics near the Black String, and we give bounds for the size of the neighborhood in which the Black String is unique.
  We compare this with the toy problem of a scalar field satisfying an elliptic equation that was already solved in arXiv:2410.20967 using different methods.
  In this case we can use the fixed point theorem method to prove not just a local but a global statement.</description>

      <title>Rotating Carroll Black Holes: A No Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Carroll black holes and in particular whether or not one could find a Carrollian analogue of a rotating black hole spacetime. Here we show that every stationary and axisymmetric solution (and thence also a black hole) of Carrollian general relativity in any number of $d&gt;3$ dimensions is necessarily also static (up to a "topological rotation"). The case of $d=3$ dimensions is special. There, the topological rotation is important and one can have a rotating Carroll BTZ black hole, obtained from a static one by the Carroll boost accompanied by the re-identification of the angular coordinate, similar to what happens in the Lorentzian case. We also find a Carrollian analogue of an accelerating black hole, showing that Schwarzschild is not the only possible stationary and axisymmetric Carroll black hole in four dimensions. A generalization of the no go theorem to include Maxwell, dilatonic, and axionic matter fields is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Decorating Asymptotically Flat Space-Time with the Moduli Space of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: N=2, 4 and 8 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensional flat space-time have moduli space of vacua. We argue that starting from a theory where the moduli approach a particular moduli space point A at infinity, we can construct a classical solution that contains an arbitrarily large space-time region where the moduli take values corresponding to any other moduli space point B of our choice to any desired accuracy. Therefore the observables of a theory with a given set of asymptotic values of the moduli will have complete information on the observables for any other asymptotic values of the moduli. Also it is physically impossible for any experiment, performed over a finite time, to determine the asymptotic values of the moduli. We point out the difference between asymptotically flat space-time and asymptotically AdS space-time in this regard and discuss the possible implication of these results for holographic duals of string theories in flat space-time. For N=2 supersymmetric theories, A and B could correspond to compactifications on topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds related by flop or conifold transitions.</description>
