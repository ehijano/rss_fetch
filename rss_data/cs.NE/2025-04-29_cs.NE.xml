      <title>Clustering-Based Evolutionary Federated Multiobjective Optimization and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, yet it faces challenges in balancing communication efficiency, model performance, and privacy protection. To address these trade-offs, we formulate FL as a federated multiobjective optimization problem and propose FedMOEAC, a clustering-based evolutionary algorithm that efficiently navigates the Pareto-optimal solution space. Our approach integrates quantization, weight sparsification, and differential privacy to reduce communication overhead while ensuring model robustness and privacy. The clustering mechanism en-hances population diversity, preventing premature convergence and improving optimization efficiency. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that FedMOEAC achieves 98.2% accuracy, reduces communication overhead by 45%, and maintains a privacy budget below 1.0, outperforming NSGA-II in convergence speed by 33%. This work provides a scalable and efficient FL framework, ensuring an optimal balance between accuracy, communication efficiency, and privacy in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Generate more than one child in your co-evolutionary semi-supervised learning GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are very useful methods to address semi-supervised learning (SSL) datasets, thanks to their ability to generate samples similar to real data. This approach, called SSL-GAN has attracted many researchers in the last decade. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to guide the evolution and training of SSL-GANs with great success. In particular, several co-evolutionary approaches have been applied where the two networks of a GAN (the generator and the discriminator) are evolved in separate populations. The co-evolutionary approaches published to date assume some spatial structure of the populations, based on the ideas of cellular evolutionary algorithms. They also create one single individual per generation and follow a generational replacement strategy in the evolution. In this paper, we re-consider those algorithmic design decisions and propose a new co-evolutionary approach, called Co-evolutionary Elitist SSL-GAN (CE-SSLGAN), with panmictic population, elitist replacement, and more than one individual in the offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that creating more than one offspring per population and using elitism improves the results in comparison with a classical SSL-GAN.</description>

      <title>Against Opacity: Explainable AI and Large Language Models for Effective Digital Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opaqueness of modern digital advertising, exemplified by platforms such as Meta Ads, raises concerns regarding their autonomous control over audience targeting, pricing structures, and ad relevancy assessments. Locked in their leading positions by network effects, ``Metas and Googles of the world'' attract countless advertisers who rely on intuition, with billions of dollars lost on ineffective social media ads. The platforms' algorithms use huge amounts of data unavailable to advertisers, and the algorithms themselves are opaque as well. This lack of transparency hinders the advertisers' ability to make informed decisions and necessitates efforts to promote transparency, standardize industry metrics, and strengthen regulatory frameworks. In this work, we propose novel ways to assist marketers in optimizing their advertising strategies via machine learning techniques designed to analyze and evaluate content, in particular, predict the click-through rates (CTR) of novel advertising content. Another important problem is that large volumes of data available in the competitive landscape, e.g., competitors' ads, impede the ability of marketers to derive meaningful insights. This leads to a pressing need for a novel approach that would allow us to summarize and comprehend complex data. Inspired by the success of ChatGPT in bridging the gap between large language models (LLMs) and a broader non-technical audience, we propose a novel system that facilitates marketers in data interpretation, called SODA, that merges LLMs with explainable AI, enabling better human-AI collaboration with an emphasis on the domain of digital marketing and advertising. By combining LLMs and explainability features, in particular modern text-image models, we aim to improve the synergy between human marketers and AI systems.</description>

      <title>BLADE: Benchmark suite for LLM-driven Automated Design and Evolution of iterative optimisation heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automated Algorithm Discovery (AAD), particularly for optimisation heuristics, is an emerging field of research. This emergence necessitates robust, standardised benchmarking practices to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven AAD methods and the resulting generated algorithms, especially given the opacity of their design process and known issues with existing benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce BLADE (Benchmark suite for LLM-driven Automated Design and Evolution), a modular and extensible framework specifically designed for benchmarking LLM-driven AAD methods in a continuous black-box optimisation context. BLADE integrates collections of benchmark problems (including MA-BBOB and SBOX-COST among others) with instance generators and textual descriptions aimed at capability-focused testing, such as generalisation, specialisation and information exploitation. It offers flexible experimental setup options, standardised logging for reproducibility and fair comparison, incorporates methods for analysing the AAD process (e.g., Code Evolution Graphs and various visualisation approaches) and facilitates comparison against human-designed baselines through integration with established tools like IOHanalyser and IOHexplainer. BLADE provides an `out-of-the-box' solution to systematically evaluate LLM-driven AAD approaches. The framework is demonstrated through two distinct use cases exploring mutation prompt strategies and function specialisation.</description>

      <title>SteelBlastQC: Shot-blasted Steel Surface Dataset with Interpretable Detection of Surface Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating the quality control of shot-blasted steel surfaces is crucial for improving manufacturing efficiency and consistency. This study presents a dataset of 1654 labeled RGB images (512x512) of steel surfaces, classified as either "ready for paint" or "needs shot-blasting." The dataset captures real-world surface defects, including discoloration, welding lines, scratches and corrosion, making it well-suited for training computer vision models. Additionally, three classification approaches were evaluated: Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with ResNet-50 feature extraction, and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The supervised methods (CCT and SVM) achieve 95% classification accuracy on the test set, with CCT leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms and SVM offering a computationally efficient alternative. The CAE approach, while less effective, establishes a baseline for unsupervised quality control. We present interpretable decision-making by all three neural networks, allowing industry users to visually pinpoint problematic regions and understand the model's rationale. By releasing the dataset and baseline codes, this work aims to support further research in defect detection, advance the development of interpretable computer vision models for quality control, and encourage the adoption of automated inspection systems in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Comparison-Relationship-Surrogate Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms often struggle to find well converged (e.g small inverted generational distance on test problems) solutions to multi-objective optimization problems on a limited budget of function evaluations (here, a few hundred). The family of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) offers a potential solution to this shortcoming through the use of data driven models which augment evaluations of the objective functions. A surrogate model which has shown promise in single-objective optimization is to predict the "comparison relationship" between pairs of solutions (i.e. who's objective function is smaller). In this paper, we investigate the performance of this model on multi-objective optimization problems. First, we propose a new algorithm "CRSEA" which uses the comparison-relationship model. Numerical experiments are then performed with the DTLZ and WFG test suites plus a real-world problem from the field of accelerator physics. We find that CRSEA finds better converged solutions than the tested SAEAs on many of the medium-scale, biobjective problems chosen from the WFG suite suggesting the comparison-relationship surrogate as a promising tool for improving the efficiency of multi-objective optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Self-organizing Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network for Multi-Step Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data uncertainty is inherent in many real-world applications and poses significant challenges for accurate time series predictions. The interval type 2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) has shown exceptional performance in uncertainty modelling for single-step prediction tasks. However, extending it for multi-step ahead predictions introduces further issues in uncertainty handling as well as model interpretability and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new selforganizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO). Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network architecture is developed. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step time series prediction problems. Second, a new link layer is created to improve the accuracy by building temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Third, a new transformation layer is designed to address the problem of the vanishing rule strength caused by high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, a two-stage, self-organizing learning mechanism is developed to automatically extract fuzzy rules from data and optimize network parameters. Experimental results on chaotic and microgrid prediction problems demonstrate that SOIT2FNN-MO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, by achieving a better accuracy ranging from 1.6% to 30% depending on the level of noises in data. Additionally, the proposed model is more interpretable, offering deeper insights into the prediction process.</description>

      <title>Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</description>
