      <title>Flexible XL-MIMO via Array Configuration Codebook: Codebook Design and Array Configuration Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XL-MIMO emerges as a promising technology to achieve unprecedented enhancements in spectral efficiency and spatial resolution, via orders-of-magnitude increase in the antenna array size. However, the practical issues of high hardware cost and power consumption pose great challenges towards the cost-effective implementation of XL-MIMO. To address such challenges, this paper proposes a novel concept called array configuration codebook (ACC), which enables flexible XL-MIMO cost-effectively and improves the system performance compared with conventional antenna selection (AS) schemes with limited number of RF chains. Specifically, ACC refers to a set of pre-designed array configuration codewords, where each codeword specifies the positions of activated antenna pixels. Then, flexible XL-MIMO architecture can be enabled via dynamical pixel activation based on the designed ACC, without having to exhaustively try all possible combinations of the antenna pixels activations. As an illustration, we give a specific codebook design, encompassing the classic compact array (CA), uniform sparse array (USA), modular array (MoA), nested array (NA), and co-prime array (CPA), and each codeword is specified by one array configuration parameter. With the designed ACC, array configuration training is considered for multi-UE communication to maximize the sum rate. To reduce the training overhead of exhaustive scanning, a two-stage scanning scheme is proposed, including the array- and pixel-level scanning. For comparison, the greedy AS scheme is proposed, where the resulting incremental SINR expression by activating antenna pixel sequentially is derived in closed-form. Subsequently, array configuration training is extended to the wireless localization scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of codeword optimization for scenarios of multi-UE communication and wireless localization.</description>

      <title>Secure Satellite Communications via Multiple Aerial RISs: Joint Optimization of Reflection, Association, and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite communication is envisioned as a key enabler of future 6G networks, yet its wide coverage with high link attenuation poses significant challenges for physical layer security. In this paper, we investigate secure multi-beam, multi-group satellite communications assisted by aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARISs). To maximize the sum of achievable multicast rates among the groups while constraining wiretap rates, we formulate a joint optimization problem involving transmission and reflection beamforming, ARIS-group association, and ARIS deployment. Due to the mixed-integral and non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we propose to decompose the problem and employ the block coordinate descent framework that iteratively solves the subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARIS-assisted multi-beam satellite system provides a notable improvement in secure communication performance under various network scenarios, offering useful insights into the deployment and optimization of intelligent surfaces in future secure satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Precoded Polar Product Decoder Based on Soft-Output SCL Decoding and Maximization of Generalized Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine two approaches to optimize the iterative decoding of product codes with precoded polar component codes. On one side, we generate bitwise soft messages based on the codebook probability, an approximation of an auxiliary quantity that considers all valid decoding paths of a successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder. On the other side, we scale the soft information during message passing with offline-computed coefficients, which maximize the generalized mutual information (GMI) between the channel input and the outgoing message in each half iteration. Simulation results show significant improvement of the error-correcting performance compared to heuristic scaling and soft information generation based solely on the candidate list of the decoder. Moreover, we present an extrinsic version of the SCL decoder, which we use in a Monte Carlo density evolution analysis to derive decoding thresholds. The computed thresholds accurately predict the performance of the decoder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar-coded multiple-input multiple-output systems are investigated. An advanced receiver implementing joint list decoding of polar codes and QR- and MMSE-based detectors is proposed. The approximate and exact path metrics are derived for joint list decoder of polar codes. A construction of polar subcodes for MIMO systems with cross-antenna dynamic freezing constraints is proposed. The obtained polar subcodes provide significant performance gain compared to LDPC-coded MIMO systems with the same rate allocation.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimal Performance-Cost Trade-Off in Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive MIMO offers uniform service via distributed access points (APs), which impose high deployment costs. A novel design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) addresses this problem by replacing some APs with a central base station, thereby lowering the costs of fronthaul network (wireless sites and fiber cables) while preserving performance. To identify the optimal uplink configuration in HCF massive MIMO, this paper provides the first comprehensive analysis, benchmarking it against cellular and CF systems. We develop a unified analytical framework for spectral efficiency that supports arbitrary combining schemes and introduce a novel hierarchical combining approach tailored to HCF two-tier architecture. Through analysis and evaluation of user fairness, system capacity, fronthaul requirements, and computational complexity, this paper identifies that HCF using centralized zero-forcing combining achieves the optimal balance between performance and cost-efficiency.</description>

      <title>What is the Most Efficient Technique for Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks to determine the most efficient uplink technique for cell-free massive MIMO systems. Despite offering great advances, existing works suffer from fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assumptions (e.g., single- vs. multi-antenna access points, ideal vs. spatially correlated channels). To address these limitations, we: (1) establish a unified analytical framework compatible with centralized/distributed processing and diverse combining schemes; (2) develop a universal optimization strategy for max-min power control; and (3) conduct a holistic study among four critical metrics: worst-case user spectral efficiency (fairness), system capacity, fronthaul signaling, and computational complexity. Through analyses and evaluation, this work ultimately identifies the optimal uplink technique for practical cell-free deployments.</description>

      <title>The Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF): A Bounded Possibilistic Framework for Ordinal State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional state estimation methods rely on probabilistic assumptions that often collapse epistemic uncertainty into scalar beliefs, risking overconfidence in sparse or adversarial sensing environments. We introduce the Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF), a novel non-Bayesian filtering framework fully grounded in possibility theory and epistemic humility. ESPF redefines the evolution of belief over state space using compatibility-weighted support updates, surprisalaware pruning, and adaptive dispersion via sparse grid quadrature. Unlike conventional filters, ESPF does not seek a posterior distribution, but rather maintains a structured region of plausibility or non-rejection, updated using ordinal logic rather than integration. For multi-model inference, we employ the Choquet integral to fuse competing hypotheses based on a dynamic epistemic capacity function, generalizing classical winner-take-all strategies. The result is an inference engine capable of dynamically contracting or expanding belief support in direct response to information structure, without requiring prior statistical calibration. This work presents a foundational shift in how inference, evidence, and ignorance are reconciled, supporting robust estimation where priors are unavailable, misleading, or epistemically unjustified.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of perfect codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perfect codes in the sum-rank metric, a generalization of both the Hamming and rank metrics relevant in multishot network coding and space-time coding. A perfect code attains equality in the sphere-packing bound, corresponding to a partition of the ambient space into disjoint metric balls. While perfect codes in the Hamming and rank metrics are completely classified, the existence of nontrivial perfect codes in the sum-rank metric remains largely open. In this paper, we investigate linear perfect codes in the sum-rank metric. We analyze the geometry of balls and derive bounds on their volumes, showing how the sphere-packing bound applies. For two-block spaces, we determine explicit parameter constraints for the existence of perfect codes. For multiple-block spaces, we establish non-existence results for various ranges of minimum distance, divisibility conditions, and code dimensions. We further provide computational evidence based on congruence conditions imposed by the volume of metric balls.</description>

      <title>On Secrecy Capacity of Binary Beampointing Channels with Block Memory and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy capacity of the binary beampointing (BBP) channel with block memory and feedback, a simplified yet insightful model for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems with beamformed transmissions and backscatter feedback. We consider a system where a legitimate receiver and a passive eavesdropper experience independent and uniformly distributed angular directions over transmission blocks, with the base station receiving noiseless, unit-delayed feedback from both, under the per-symbol input cost constraints. We establish a closed-form upper bound on the secrecy capacity, which is based on the main channel between the base station and the legitimate receiver. Moreover, we propose a joint communication and adaptive sensing (JCAS) scheme and derive its achievable secrecy rate. Simulation results show that the gap between the inner and outer bounds narrows as the number of block length increases. This reveals the efficiency of this JCAS scheme, which strategically leverages feedback to balance the demands of sensing the legitimate user and preventing information leakage to the eavesdropper.</description>

      <title>On the Sensing Capacity of Gaussian "Beam-Pointing" Channels with Block Memory and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the demands of high-frequency wireless communications in 5G and 6G systems (e.g., mmWave, sub-THz), we explore a state-dependent {\em Gaussian beam-pointing} (GBP) channel. In this model, the channel state defines an unknown angle of departure (AoD), which remains constant within each coherence block of $Q$ time slots but changes independently across blocks. The transmitter receives strictly causal feedback which may originate from a radar detection system or explicit feedback from the receiver at the end of each slot and estimates the AoD at the end of each block. To enhance transmission efficiency, we propose a joint communication and sensing scheme. While the communication capacity of the GBP channel has been previously analyzed by the authors, this work focuses on sensing capacity, characterized by the mutual information between the channel state and the feedback conditioned on the transmitted signal. We derive an upper bound using dynamic programming and propose an achievable inner bound on the sensing capacity, both formulated as optimization problems. For the special case of $Q=1$, the proposed transmission scheme achieves the optimal sensing rate and highlights the inherent trade-off between sensing and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring Scientific Group Performance: Integrating h-Group and Homogeneity into the $\alpha$-Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1060</link>
      <description>arXiv:1002.1060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ranking groups of researchers is important in several contexts and can serve many purposes such as the fair distribution of grants based on the scientist's publication output, concession of research projects, classification of journal editorial boards and many other applications in a social context. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the performance of groups of researchers. The proposed method is called alpha-index and it is based on two parameters: (i) the homogeneity of the h-indexes of the researchers in the group; and (ii) the h-group, which is an extension of the h-index for groups. Our method integrates the concepts of homogeneity and absolute value of the h-index into a single measure which is appropriate for the evaluation of groups. We report on experiments that assess computer science conferences based on the h-indexes of their program committee members. Our results are similar to a manual classification scheme adopted by a research agency.</description>

      <title>Optimal Construction of N-bit-delay Almost Instantaneous Fixed-to-Variable-Length Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal construction of $N$-bit-delay almost instantaneous fixed-to-variable-length (AIFV) codes, the general form of binary codes we can make when finite bits of decoding delay are allowed. The presented method enables us to optimize lossless codes among a broader class of codes compared to the conventional FV and AIFV codes. The paper first discusses the problem of code construction, which contains some essential partial problems, and defines three classes of optimality to clarify how far we can solve the problems. The properties of the optimal codes are analyzed theoretically, showing the sufficient conditions for achieving the optimum. Then, we propose an algorithm for constructing $N$-bit-delay AIFV codes for given stationary memory-less sources. The optimality of the constructed codes is discussed both theoretically and empirically. They showed shorter expected code lengths when $N\ge 3$ than the conventional AIFV-$m$ and extended Huffman codes. Moreover, in the random numbers simulation, they performed higher compression efficiency than the 32-bit-precision range codes under reasonable conditions.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have substantially improved communication performance, but their high computational cost hinders practical deployment. Moreover, certain applications require the ability to dynamically adapt computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a Feature Importance-Aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC) model for image transmission that is both computationally efficient and adjustable. FAJSCC employs axis-dimension specialized computation, which performs efficient operations individually for each spatial and channel axis, significantly reducing computational cost while representing features effectively. It further incorporates selective deformable self-attention, which applies self-attention only to selected and adaptively adjusted regions, leveraging the importance and relations of input features to efficiently capture complex feature correlations. Another key feature of FAJSCC is that the number of selected important areas can be controlled separately by the encoder and the decoder, depending on the available computational budget. It makes FAJSCC the first deepJSCC architecture to allow independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. Experimental results show that FAJSCC achieves superior image transmission performance under various channel conditions while requiring less computational complexity than recent state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, experiments independently varying the encoder and decoder's computational resources reveal, for the first time in the deepJSCC literature, that understanding the meaning of noisy features in the decoder demands the greatest computational cost. The code is publicly available at github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCCv2.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Exact Sampling under R\'enyi Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of exact sampling under an exponential communication cost, specifically Campbell's average codeword length $L(t)$ of order $t$, and R\'enyi's entropy. We provide a lower bound on the Campbell cost of exact sampling that grows approximately as $D_{\frac{1}{\alpha}}(P||Q)$, the R\'enyi divergence of order $1/\alpha$, with $\alpha = \frac{1}{1+t}$. Using the Poisson functional representation of Li and El Gamal, we prove an upper bound on $L(t)$ whose leading R\'enyi divergence term has order within $\epsilon$ of that of the lower bound. Our results reduce to the bounds of Harsha et al. as $\alpha \to 1$. We also provide numerical examples comparing the bounds in the cases of normal and Laplacian distributions, demonstrating that the upper and lower bounds are typically within 5-10 bits of each other. Our results characterize exactly the optimal asymptotic Campbell cost $L(t)$ per sample as the number of i.i.d. samples grows to infinity. We show that under the exponential cost, any causal sampler performs strictly worse asymptotically than noncausal samplers. This contrasts with the case of expected message length, where both causal and noncausal samplers have the same optimal asymptotic cost.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form BER Analysis for Uplink NOMA with Dynamic SIC Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper, for the first time, presents a closed-form error performance analysis of uplink power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with dynamic successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding, where the decoding order is adapted to the instantaneous channel conditions. We first develop an analytical framework that characterizes how dynamic ordering affects error probabilities in uplink PD-NOMA systems. For a two-user system over independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels, we derive closed-form probability density functions (PDFs) of ordered channel gains and the corresponding unconditional pairwise error probabilities (PEPs). To address the mathematical complexity of characterizing ordered channel distributions, we employ a Gaussian fitting to approximate truncated distributions while maintaining analytical tractability. Finally, we extend the bit error rate analysis for various $M$-quadrature amplitude modulation schemes (QAM) in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that dynamic SIC eliminates the error floor issue observed in fixed-order SIC, achieving significantly improved performance in high signal-to-noise ratio regions. Our findings also highlight that larger power differences are essential for higher-order modulations, offering concrete guidance for practical uplink PD-NOMA deployment.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn with Coordinated TDMA on Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wi-Fi plays a crucial role in connecting electronic devices and providing communication services in everyday life. Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for low-latency traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.</description>

      <title>Tight frames over the quaternions and equiangular lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that much of the theory of finite tight frames can be generalised to vector spaces over the quaternions. This includes the variational characterisation, group frames, and the characterisations of projective and unitary equivalence. We are particularly interested in sets of equiangular lines (equi-isoclinic subspaces) and the groups associated with them, and how to move them between the spaces $\Rd$, $\Cd$ and $\Hd$. We discuss what the analogue of Zauner's conjecture for equiangular lines in $\Hd$ might be.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Equal-Difference Structure of Cyclotomic Cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we present an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</description>
