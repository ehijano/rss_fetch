      <title>High Socioeconomic Status is Associated with Diverse Consumption across Brands and Price Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumption practices are determined by a combination of economic, social, and cultural forces. We posit that lower economic constraints leave more room to diversify consumption along cultural and social aspects in the form of omnivorous or lifestyle-based niche consumption. We provide empirical evidence for this diversity hypothesis by analysing millions of mobile-tracked visits from thousands of Census Block Groups to thousands of stores in New York State. The results show that high income is significantly associated with diverse consumption across brands and price levels. The associations between diversity and income persist but are less prominent for necessity-based consumption and for the densely populated and demographically diverse New York City. The associations replicate for education as an alternative measure of socioeconomic status and for the state of Texas. We further illustrate that the associations cannot be explained by simple geographic constraints, including the neighbourhoods' demographic diversity, the residents' geographic mobility and the stores' local availability, so deeper social and cultural factors must be at play.</description>

      <title>Life cycle assessment tools for road design: analysing linearity assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road infrastructure significantly impacts how people move and live and the emissions associated with travel behaviour. The design of roads is crucial in mitigating emissions. This paper reviews existing transport life cycle assessment tools that have been developed by various entities and can be used for roads. The review focuses on data sources used in the analysis, methods of estimating carbon dioxide emissions, the underlying software that is used to make the estimates, and any limitations of the tools. A critical issue identified in life cycle assessment analysis is the erroneous assumption that relationships within the assessed systems are linear. The current tools focusing on transport infrastructure assessment were developed based on the linear assumptions and limitations of the life cycle assessment analysis. A significant research gap identified is that existing life cycle assessment tools are not integrated with the design process. The analysis is an add-on process to design and the results of an assessment are not then used iteratively to enhance the design. A case study on aggregate road design found that road area significantly correlates with emissions, slope adjustments reduce emissions, and soil type impacts emissions, suggesting future research should explore non-linear relationships for sustainable road design.</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of India's Industrial Interdependencies: 7-Digit Product-Level Supply-Use and Input-Output Tables from ASI Data (2016-2022) with a Case Study of the Mobile Phone Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outlines the construction of high-resolution, 7-digit product-level Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian economy, leveraging microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the period 2016-2022. We delineate a robust methodology encompassing the generation of detailed input and output flows, with a particular focus on the reconciliation of data from registered and unregistered manufacturing sectors through a meticulously developed NPCMS-NIC concordance. The critical transformation from the often-rectangular SUTs to square, symmetric product-by-product IOTs is explicated using the Industry Technology Assumption, a choice justified by its suitability for handling by-products prevalent in a diverse manufacturing landscape. The analytical prowess of this newly constructed high-resolution IOT framework is then demonstrated through its application to assess key economic impacts, specifically the Domestic Value Added (DVA) generated and the employment supported by production and export activities. A detailed case study of India's rapidly evolving mobile phone manufacturing sector (NPCMS 4722200) for the 2016-2022 period reveals profound structural shifts: significant output growth coupled with notable import substitution, a remarkable surge in exports, and a dynamic evolution in the DVA versus Foreign Value Added (FVA) shares, particularly in export-oriented production. The analysis further uncovers substantial employment growth, albeit with an increasing reliance on contractual labour and a heartening rise in female participation in the workforce. These meticulously constructed tables represent a significant methodological advancement and provide an invaluable empirical resource for nuanced analysis of sectoral interdependencies, the efficacy of industrial policy, and the complex dynamics of India's engagement with global value chains.</description>

      <title>The Bones and Shapes of the Phillips Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic reignited debate on the U.S. Phillips curve. Using MSA-level panel data (2001-2024), we employ a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) instrumental variable strategy with a shift-share instrument to estimate core non-tradable inflation's response to a v/u-based slack measure. We distinguish structural slope stability from state-dependent non-linearities via a threshold model. Our analysis addresses whether the slope of the Phillips Curve changed during and after the Pandemic in the United States by evaluating if recent inflation dynamics reflect an altered structural trade-off ("bones") or the activation of non-linear "shapes" in response to extreme labor market tightness. This distinction offers critical insights into the unemployment cost of disinflation.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of deliberative discussions of the UK food system: stimuli, demographics, and opinion reversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing acknowledgement - including from the UK government - of the benefit of employing deliberative processes (deliberative fora, citizens' juries, etc.). Evidence suggests that the qualitative reporting of deliberative fora are often unclear or imprecise. If this is the case, their value to policymakers could be diminished. In this study we develop numerical methods of deliberative processes to document people's preferences, as a complement to qualitative analysis. Data are taken from the Food Conversation, a nationwide public consultation on reformations of the food system comprising 345 members of the general public. Each participant attended 5 workshops, each with differing stimuli covering subtopics of the food system. In each workshop, individuals twice reported responsibility, from 0-10, for changing the food system for 5 stakeholders (governments, the food industry, supermarkets, farmers, individuals). Analyses examined individuals' perceptions of food system change responsibility. Governments were most responsible and farmers least so. We assessed variation by workshop content, and by demographics. Reported responsibility changed most for individuals, and changed least for the food industry. We devise a model to document a reversion effect, where shifts in perceptions on responsibility that occurred during workshops waned over time; this was strongest among those who intended to vote (rather than not to). These results can support qualitative analyses and inform food system policy development. These methods are readily adopted for any such deliberative process, allowing for statistical evaluation of whether they can induce opinion change.</description>

      <title>An advanced reliability reserve incentivizes flexibility investments while safeguarding the electricity market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure security of supply in the power sector, many countries are already using or discussing the introduction of capacity mechanisms. Two main types of such mechanisms include capacity markets and capacity reserves. Simultaneously, the expansion of variable renewable energy sources increases the need for power sector flexibility, for which there are promising yet often under-utilized options on the demand side. In this paper, we analyze how a centralized capacity market and an advanced reliability reserve with a moderately high activation price affect investments in demand-side flexibility technologies. We do so for a German case study of 2030, using an open-source capacity expansion model and incorporating detailed demand-side flexibility potentials across industry, process heat, and district heating. We show that a centralized capacity market effectively caps peak prices in the wholesale electricity market and thus reduces incentives for investments in demand-side flexibility options. The advanced reliability reserve induces substantially higher flexibility investments while leading to similar overall electricity supply costs and ensuring a similar level of security of supply. The advanced reliability reserve could thus create a learning environment for flexibility technologies to support the transition to climate neutral energy systems. Additionally, an advanced reliability reserve could be introduced faster and is more flexible than a centralized capacity market. While concrete design parameters are yet to be specified, we argue that policymakers should consider the reliability reserve concept in upcoming decision on capacity mechanisms in Germany and beyond.</description>

      <title>Towards an Approach for Evaluating the Impact of AI Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been multiple calls for investments in the development of AI standards that both preserve the transformative potential and minimize the risks of AI. The goals of AI standards, particularly with respect to AI data, performance, and governance, are to promote innovation and public trust in systems that use AI. However, there is a lack of a formal or shared method to measure the impact of these standardization activities on the goals of innovation and trust. This concept paper proposes an analytical approach that could inform the evaluation of the impact of AI standards. The proposed approach could be used to measure, assess, and eventually evaluate the extent to which AI standards achieve their stated goals, since most Standards Development Organizationss do not track the impact of their standards once completed. It is intended to stimulate discussions with a wide variety of stakeholders, including academia and the standards community, about the potential for the approach to evaluate the effectiveness, utility, and relative value of AI standards. The document draws on successful and well-tested evaluation frameworks, tools, and metrics that are used for monitoring and assessing the effect of programmatic interventions in other domains to describe a possible approach. It begins by describing the context within which an evaluation would be designed, and then introduces a standard evaluation framework. These sections are followed by a description of what outputs and outcomes might result from the adoption and implementation of AI standards and the process whereby those AI standards are developed . Subsequent sections provide an overview of how the effectiveness of AI standards might be assessed and a conclusion.</description>

      <title>Thermal Macroeconomics: An axiomatic theory of aggregate economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure of thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate properties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money, prices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic foundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents. The approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid foundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence of market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry and negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong rationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach generates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two or more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic entropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these are related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market prices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and gives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts, such as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in standard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and implications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility of money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in macroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy (governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may prove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>Bridging Voting and Deliberation with Algorithms: Field Insights from vTaiwan and Kultur Komitee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Democratic processes increasingly aim to integrate large-scale voting with face-to-face deliberation, addressing the challenge of reconciling individual preferences with collective decision-making. This work introduces new methods that use algorithms and computational tools to bridge online voting with face-to-face deliberation, tested in two real-world scenarios: Kultur Komitee 2024 (KK24) and vTaiwan. These case studies highlight the practical applications and impacts of the proposed methods.
  We present three key contributions: (1) Preference-based Clustering for Deliberation (PCD), which enables both in-depth and broad discussions in deliberative settings by computing homogeneous and heterogeneous group compositions with balanced and adjustable group sizes; (2) Human-in-the-loop MES, a practical method that enhances the Method of Equal Shares (MES) algorithm with real-time digital feedback. This builds algorithmic trust by giving participants full control over how much decision-making is delegated to the voting aggregation algorithm as compared to deliberation; and (3) the ReadTheRoom deliberation method, which uses opinion space mapping to identify agreement and divergence, along with spectrum-based preference visualisation to track opinion shifts during deliberation. This approach enhances transparency by clarifying collective sentiment and fosters collaboration by encouraging participants to engage constructively with differing perspectives. By introducing these actionable frameworks, this research extends in-person deliberation with scalable digital methods that address the complexities of modern decision-making in participatory processes.</description>
