      <title>Machine-learning Growth at Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse growth vulnerabilities in the US using quantile partial correlation regression, a selection-based machine-learning method that achieves model selection consistency under time series. We find that downside risk is primarily driven by financial, labour-market, and housing variables, with their importance changing over time. Decomposing downside risk into its individual components, we construct sector-specific indices that predict it, while controlling for information from other sectors, thereby isolating the downside risks emanating from each sector.</description>

      <title>Does Trump's Tariff Make America Great Again? An Empirical Analysis of US-China Trade War Impact on American Business Formation (2018-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines whether Donald Trump's tariff policies, particularly the US-China trade war initiated in 2018, delivered on promises to revitalize American manufacturing and create jobs. Using county-level business application data from 2018-2025, we analyze the relationship between tariff implementation and new business formation through linear regression analysis. Our findings reveal a statistically significant positive association between US tariffs on China and American business applications. However, when Chinese retaliatory tariffs are included in the analysis, their negative coefficient substantially exceeds the positive US tariff effect, suggesting that retaliatory measures largely offset the benefits of protectionist policies. Control variables including inflation rate, federal funds rate, and government spending show significant positive effects on business formation. These results indicate that while protectionist trade policies may stimulate domestic business formation, their effectiveness is significantly diminished by retaliatory responses from trading partners. The study provides evidence that unilateral tariff measures without diplomatic coordination produce limited net benefits, confirming that trade wars create scenarios where potential gains are neutralized by counteractions.</description>

      <title>Spending Behavior and Economic Impacts of Urban Digital Consumption Vouchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the Taipei Bear Vouchers 2.0 program using verified user-level survey data and a regional input-output model to assess the effectiveness of consumption vouchers as a fiscal stimulus tool. We focus on three key behavioral mechanisms: expenditure substitution, induced consumption, and the intensity of treatment through varying voucher face values. Our findings show that voucher effectiveness differs by type. Accommodation vouchers stimulate the most additional spending due to low expenditure substitution and high induced consumption effects, while sports vouchers often replace existing consumption. Increases in voucher value further enhance marginal consumption, especially when this change is a part of unexpected policy. Taking these behavioral responses into account, we find that the output multiplier of the program rises significantly, and indirect benefits extend to untargeted sectors through inter-industry linkages. These results highlight the critical role of consumer behavior in shaping policy outcomes and offer practical guidance for designing more effective and targeted consumption voucher programs.</description>

      <title>Effect of Insecurity on Agricultural Output in Benue State, Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examined the effect of insecurity on agricultural output in Benue state. A descriptive survey design was employed, and 400 respondents were purposively selected from insecurity-prone local government areas, namely, Guma LGA, Agatu LGA, Gwer LGA, Gwer-West LGA, Katsina-Ala LGA, Logo LGA, Ukum LGA and Kwande LGA. The data were collected through the administration of a questionnaire and were analysed using t tests and structural equation modelling (SEM). The t-test was used to compare farmers' incomes before and after the insecurity in the study area to assess if the differences were statistically significant, while Structural Equation Modelling analysed the complex relationships among multiple variables, employing regression and factor analysis to model both direct and indirect effects. The results revealed that the monetary value of crop and livestock output decreased during periods of insecurity. Furthermore, the study showed that insecurity has an adverse effect on crop and livestock output. This means that a one percent increase in insecurity leads to a 0.211% and 0.311% decrease in crop and livestock output respectively. The study concluded that insecurity reduced agricultural output in Benue state. Based on the findings, it was recommended that the government deploy more security personnel, establish community policing initiatives, and employ modern surveillance technologies to deter criminal activities in insecure areas. Additionally, for places experiencing farmer-herder conflict, the government should provide grazing reserves for herdsmen and further strengthen the state law on open grazing prohibition and the establishment of ranch law.</description>

      <title>Pricing the Right to Renege in Search Markets: Evidence from Trucking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many markets, advance interim contracts include an explicit right to renege, granting one party the option to switch to more efficient matches that emerge later in the search process. This paper studies the formation and welfare implications of such interim contracts, leveraging novel data from a brokerage firm in the trucking industry. The broker allocates advance shipment contracts to carriers through a dynamic auction mechanism and penalizes cancellations through a reputational mechanism. I develop a theoretical model linking the carrier's bidding problem to the firm's cancellation penalties through a dynamic job-search problem and structurally estimate the model from rich data on bids and cancellations. In counterfactual simulations, I show that the firm is incentivized to lower cancellation penalties as the option value of the right to renege is priced into carrier bids. The results rationalize the large degree of contractual flexibility observed in the trucking industry as an efficient market outcome rather than one constrained by limited enforcement.</description>

      <title>Balancing Profit and Fairness in Risk-Based Pricing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit. We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties. Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source, scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms -- and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S. health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Mobility Trends and the Changing Role of Female Labor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using harmonized administrative data from Scandinavia, we find that intergenerational rank associations in income have increased uniformly across Sweden, Denmark, and Norway for cohorts born between 1951 and 1979. By gender, father-son mobility remains stable, while correlations for mothers and daughters rise. Similar patterns appear in US survey data, albeit with different timing. We show that the decline in income mobility reflects female income more accurately capturing underlying productivity, rather than stronger intergenerational transmission of human capital or changes in assortative mating. Finally, we show parent-child correlations increase mainly when women gain access to jobs that match their productivity.</description>

      <title>Composite Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an assignment model with concave costs of skill gaps, which arise generally when firms mitigate costs of mismatch as in Stigler (1939) and Laffont and Tirole (1986, 1991). Concave costs of skill gaps imply that the output function is neither supermodular nor submodular. We thus introduce a tractable model that interpolates between the polar canonical cases of supermodularity and submodularity. We characterize sorting, wages, and comparative statics and show these substantively differ from traditional assignment models. Under composite sorting: (1) distinct worker types work in the same occupation, and (2) worker types are simultaneously part of both positive and negative sorting. Quantitatively, our model can generate and help explain earnings dispersion between and within occupations.</description>

      <title>The long-term impact of (un)conditional cash transfers on labour market outcomes in Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries, evidence on their long-term effects remains scarce. This study assesses the impact of Ecuador's Human Development Grant on the formal sector labour market outcomes of children in eligible households. This grant, one of the first of its kind, is characterized by weak enforcement of its eligibility criteria. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the programme had no overall impact on formal employment rates and labour income earned in the formal sector around 15 years after exposure, and thus not affecting the intergenerational transmission of poverty. We only document a positive effect on the non-mestizo population (mainly consisting of indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorians).</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence and financial crises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) poses new and poorly understood threats to financial stability. We use a game-theoretic model to analyse the stability impact of AI, finding it amplifies existing financial system vulnerabilities - leverage, liquidity stress and opacity - through superior information processing, common data, speed and strategic complementarities. The consequence is crises become faster and more severe, where the likelihood of a crisis is directly affected by how effectively the authorities engage with AI. In response, we propose the authorities develop their own AI systems and expertise, set up direct AI-to-AI communication, implement automated crisis facilities and monitor AI use.</description>

      <title>Towards post-growth policymaking: Barriers and enablers for wellbeing economy and Doughnut economics government initiatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing wellbeing for all while safeguarding planetary boundaries may require governments to pursue post-growth policies. To understand how post-growth policymaking can be fostered, we examine wellbeing economy and Doughnut economics government initiatives across governance scales in Europe, New Zealand, and Canada. To identify political dimensions of barriers and enablers as well as priorities for future action, we apply a framework that distinguishes polity, politics, and policy to analyze the data. We find that the main barriers are polity-related contextual factors while the main enablers are the political agency of key individuals and positive framings of post-growth visions. Despite the focus of the post-growth literature on policies, our results suggest they have limited transformative potential in the current system. The overarching economic growth paradigm severely limits the initiatives' scope of action. Highly motivated individuals and high-level political support are more essential in driving initiatives than pressure from civil society. Practitioners who promote growth-critical perspectives often face tensions: they need to appeal to broad stakeholder groups while avoiding cooptation. Overall, our findings suggest that further structural changes are required to support post-growth initiatives: a greater presence of post-growth approaches in economics education and the media is required for post-growth discourses to become more accepted, and to build understandings of how growth dependencies can be addressed.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Public Opinion on X: A Real-Time Sentiment Dashboard Using VADER and DistilBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the age of social media, understanding public sentiment toward major corporations is crucial for investors, policymakers, and researchers. This paper presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis system tailored for corporate reputation monitoring, combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to accurately interpret public opinion in real time. The methodology integrates a hybrid sentiment detection framework leveraging both rule-based models (VADER) and transformer-based deep learning models (DistilBERT), applied to social media data from multiple platforms. The system begins with robust preprocessing involving noise removal and text normalization, followed by sentiment classification using an ensemble approach to ensure both interpretability and contextual accuracy. Results are visualized through sentiment distribution plots, comparative analyses, and temporal sentiment trends for enhanced interpretability. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in public sentiment across major corporations, with companies like Amazon (81.2) and Samsung (45.8) receiving excellent sentiment scores, while Microsoft (21.7) and Walmart (21.9) exhibit poor sentiment profiles. These findings demonstrate the utility of our multi-source sentiment framework in providing actionable insights regarding corporate public perception, enabling stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions based on comprehensive sentiment analysis.</description>
