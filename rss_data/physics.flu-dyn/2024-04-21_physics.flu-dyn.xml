      <title>Advancing Petroleum Engineering Solutions: Integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Enhanced Buckley-Leverett Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical principles-typically mathematical models expressed as differential equations-into the machine learning (ML) processes to guarantee the physical validity of ML model solutions. This approach has gained traction in science and engineering for modeling a wide range of physical phenomena. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of PINNs in solving nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), is found challenging due to discontinuities inherent in such PDE solutions. While previous research has focused on advancing training algorithms, our study highlights that encoding precise physical laws into PINN framework suffices to address the challenge. By coupling well-constructed governing equations into the most basic, simply structured PINNs, this research tackles both data-independent solution and data-driven discovery of the Buckley-Leverett equation, a typical hyperbolic PDE central to modeling multi-phase fluid flow in porous media. Our results reveal that vanilla PINNs are adequate to solve the Buckley-Leverett equation with superior precision and even handling more complex scenarios including variations in fluid mobility ratios, the addition of a gravity term to the original governing equation, and the presence of multiple discontinuities in the solution. This capability of PINNs enables accurate, efficient modeling and prediction of practical engineering problems, such as water flooding, polymer flooding, inclined flooding, and carbon dioxide injection into saline aquifers. Furthermore, the forward PINN framework with slight modifications can be adapted for inverse problems, allowing the estimation of PDE parameters in the Buckley-Leverett equation from observed data. Sensitivity analysis demonstrate that PINNs remain effective under conditions of slight data scarcity and up to a 5% data impurity.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Active Flow Control of an Elliptical Cylinder: Transitioning from an Elliptical Cylinder to a Circular Cylinder and a Flat Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Active Flow Control (AFC) technology supported by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in suppressing vortex shedding, reducing drag, and minimizing lift coefficients around elliptical cylinders. The aspect ratio Ar of the elliptical cylinder transitions from an ellipsoid Ar=2 to a circular shape Ar=1, and ultimately to a flat plate Ar=0. We utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on both the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder. The focus is on optimizing fluid dynamics and examining the scalability of these control techniques across different geometric configurations. Our research findings indicate that, for elliptical cylinders with aspect ratios between 1.75 and 0.75, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 0.9% to 15.7%, and the reduction in lift coefficient ranges from 95.2% to 99.7%. Notably, the DRL-based control strategy not only significantly reduces lift and drag, but also completely suppresses vortex shedding while using less than 1% of external excitation energy, demonstrating its efficiency and energy-saving capabilities. Additionally, for aspect ratios from 0.5 to 0, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 26.9% to 43.6%, and the reduction in lift coefficient from 50.2% to 68.0%. This reflects the control strategy's significant reduction in both drag and lift coefficients, while also alleviating vortex shedding. This underscores the adaptability and potential of DRL-based AFC in managing complex fluid dynamics across diverse elliptical cylinder configurations.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity finite volume scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations using boundary variation diminishing algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-fidelity finite volume scheme based on the BVD (boundary variation diminishing) concept is proposed in this study to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. A hybrid spatial reconstruction profile, consisting of a quadratic polynomial and a steepness-adjustable hyperbolic tangent function, is adopted to reproduce the accurate solutions of the complex magnetohydrodynamics flows. The BVD principle is used to find a optimal combination of these two types of spatial reconstructions by comparing the variations of the interface values interpolated in two adjacent cells, aiming to remove the non-physical oscillations around discontinuities by switching the quadratic polynomial to a step-shaped function. Additionally, a constrained transport (CT) method is applied in this study to assure the non-divergent solution of the magnetic field. The widely used numerical tests in one and two dimensional cases were checked in this study. The numerical results can retrieve the accuracy of a $3^{rd}$-order linear scheme in the convergence test for both advection and MHD equations and capture the strong shock waves in MHD flows without spurious oscillations. In comparison with the results of a $3^{rd}$-order WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) scheme, the proposed scheme gains more accurate solutions not only for the strong discontinuities but also the smooth structures across scales. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a high-fidelity model for ideal MHD equations by a BVD algorithm. Numerical results are competitive to those of existing advanced models and thus the BVD algorithm has promising potentials to build practical models for various MHD flows.</description>

      <title>The MEMENTO code for modelling of macroscopic melt motion in fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MEMENTO (MEtallic Melt Evolution in Next-step TOkamaks) code is a new numerical implementation of the physics model originally developed for the MEMOS-U code with the objective to self-consistently describe the generation of melt and its subsequent large scale dynamics in fusion devices and to assess the damage of metallic reactor armor under powerful normal and off-normal plasma events. The model has been validated in multiple dedicated EUROfusion experiments. MEMENTO solves the heat and phase transfer problem coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the shallow water approximation for the thin liquid film over the solid metal and with the current propagation equations on a domain that features a time-evolving deforming metal-plasma interface. The code utilizes non-uniform and adaptive meshing along with sub-cycling in time facilitated by the AMReX open-source framework as well as AMReX's built-in parallelization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Interpreting neural operators: how nonlinear waves propagate in non-reciprocal solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven pipeline for model building that combines interpretable machine learning, hydrodynamic theories, and microscopic models. The goal is to uncover the underlying processes governing nonlinear dynamics experiments. We exemplify our method with data from microfluidic experiments where crystals of streaming droplets support the propagation of nonlinear waves absent in passive crystals. By combining physics-inspired neural networks, known as neural operators, with symbolic regression tools, we generate the solution, as well as the mathematical form, of a nonlinear dynamical system that accurately models the experimental data. Finally, we interpret this continuum model from fundamental physics principles. Informed by machine learning, we coarse grain a microscopic model of interacting droplets and discover that non-reciprocal hydrodynamic interactions stabilise and promote nonlinear wave propagation.</description>

      <title>On the theory of body motion in confined Stokesian fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical method to decompose the solution of a Stokes flow past a body immersed in a confined fluid in two simpler problems, related separately to the two geometrical elements of these systems: (i) the body immersed in the unbounded fluid (represented by its Fax\'en operators), and (ii) the domain of the confinement (represented by its Stokesian multipoles). Specifically, by using a reflection method, and assuming linear and reciprocal boundary conditions \citep{procopio-giona_pof}, we provide the expression for the velocity field, the forces, torques and higher-order moments acting on the body in terms of: (i) the volume moments of the body in the unbounded ambient flow; (ii) the multipoles in the domain of the confinement; (iii) the collection of all the volumetric moments on the body immersed in all the regular parts of the multipoles considered as ambient flows. A detailed convergence analysis of the reflection method is developed. In the light of practical applications, we estimate the truncation error committed by considering only the lower order moments (thus truncating the matrices) and the errors associated with the approximated expressions available in the literature for force and torques. We apply the theoretical results to the archetypal hydrodynamic system of a sphere with Navier-slip boundary conditions near a plane wall with no-slip boundary conditions, to determine forces and torques on a translating and rotating sphere as a function of the slip length and of the distance of the sphere from the plane. The hydromechanics of a spheroid is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Response of premixed Jet Flames to Blast Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study investigates the response dynamics of premixed jet flames when incident with blast waves along the jet axis. In the present work, blast waves are generated using the wire-explosion technique. The generated blast wave interacts with premixed jet flames that are stabilised over a thin fuel-air jet nozzle. The study is performed over a wide range of parametric space, varying the Reynolds number ($Re$) and normalised equivalence ratio ($\Phi$) of the premixed jet and the strength of the generated blast fronts ($M_{s,r}$). The blast wave imposes a decaying flow field profile characterised by a sharp discontinuity at the blast front. This is accompanied by a subsequent induced flow arising due to entertainment from the surroundings as the blast-imposed flow fields decay to sub-ambient levels. While the jet flame is observed to respond to the blast front with a jittery motion, it is found to lift off following the interaction with the induced flow. Depending on the operating conditions ($Re$, $\Phi$, and $M_{s,r}$), the flame lift-off is followed by an extinction or a re-attachment event. The flame response is further classified into two re-attachment and three extinction sub-regimes based on the response dynamics of the flame base and flame tip following the interaction process. The flame response entails flame base lift-off and flame tip distortion, potentially leading to a flame pinch-off event contingent on the operating conditions. A mathematical model was developed to explain the flame base response dynamics, yielding a scaling law for flame base lift-off height. Flame tip response trends were elucidated by extending the vorticity transport equation to estimate the vortex roll-up rate in the shear boundary surrounding the flame. Flame pinch-off was observed when shear layer vortices reached critical circulation limits and shed at length scales lower than the flame height.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Linear Homogenization for Large-Inertia Laminar Transport across Permeable Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Porous membranes are thin solid structures that allow the flow to pass through their tiny openings, called pores. Flow inertia may play a significant role in several filtration flows of natural and engineering interest. Here, we develop a predictive macroscopic model to describe solvent and solute flows past thin membranes for non-negligible inertia. We leverage homogenization theory to link the solvent velocity and solute concentration to the jumps of solvent stress and solute flux across the membrane. Within this framework, the membrane acts as a boundary separating two distinct fluid regions. These jump conditions rely on several coefficients, stemming from closure problems at the microscopic pore scale. Two approximations for the advective terms of Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion equations are introduced to include inertia in the microscopic problem. The approximate inertial terms couple the micro- and macroscopic fields. Here, this coupling is solved numerically using an iterative fixed-point procedure. We compare the resulting models against full-scale simulations, with a good agreement both in terms of averaged values across the membrane and far-field values. Eventually, we develop a strategy based on unsupervised machine learning to improve the computational efficiency of the iterative procedure. The extension of homogenization toward weak-inertia flow configurations as well as the performed data-driven approximation may find application in preliminary analyses as well as optimization procedures toward the design of filtration systems, where inertia effects can be instrumental in broadening the spectrum of permeability and selectivity properties of these filters.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of dynamic wetting behavior through curved microchannels with automated image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preventing fluid penetration poses a challenging reliability concern in the context of power electronics, which is usually caused by unforeseen microfractures along the sealing joints. A better and more reliable product design heavily depends on the understanding of the dynamic wetting processes happening inside these complex microfractures, i.e. microchannels. A novel automated image processing procedure is proposed in this work for analyzing the moving interface and the dynamic contact angle in microchannels. In particular, the developed method is advantageous for experiments involving non-transparent samples, where extracting the fluid interface geometry poses a significant challenge. The developed method is validated with theoretical values and manual measurements and exhibits high accuracy. The implementation is made publicly available. The developed method is validated and applied to experimental investigations of forced wetting with two working fluids (water and 50 wt% glycerin/water mixture) in four distinct microchannels characterized by different dimensions and curvature. The comparison between the experimental results and molecular kinetic theory (MKT) reveals that the dynamic wetting behavior can be described well by MKT, even in highly curved microchannels. The dynamic wetting behavior shows a strong dependency on the channel geometry and curvature.</description>

      <title>Robust and Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enhancing Flow Control around a Square Cylinder with Varying Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study applies a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to Active Flow Control (AFC) of a two-dimensional flow around a confined square cylinder. Specifically, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is employed to modulate the flow of a pair of synthetic jets placed on the upper and lower surfaces of the confined squared cylinder in flow configurations characterized by Re of 100, 200, 300, and 400. The investigation starts with an analysis of the baseline flow in the absence of active control. It is observed that at Re = 100 and Re = 200, the vortex shedding exhibits mono-frequency characteristics. Conversely, at Re = 300 and Re = 400, the vortex shedding is dominated by multiple frequencies, which is indicative of more complex flow features. With the application of the SAC algorithm, we demonstrate the capability of DRL-based control in effectively suppressing vortex shedding, while significantly diminishing drag and fluctuations in lift. Quantitatively, the data-driven active control strategy results in a drag reduction of approximately 14.4%, 26.4%, 38.9%, and 47.0% for Re = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. To understand the underlying control mechanism, we also present detailed flow field comparisons, which showcase the adaptability of DRL in devising distinct control strategies tailored to the dynamic conditions at varying Re. These findings substantiate the proficiency of DRL in controlling chaotic, multi-frequency dominated vortex shedding phenomena, underscoring the robustness of DRL in complex AFC problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallelization Strategies for Active Flow Control in Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for handling highly dynamic and nonlinear Active Flow Control (AFC) problems. However, the computational cost associated with training DRL models presents a significant performance bottleneck. To address this challenge and enable efficient scaling on high-performance computing architectures, this study focuses on optimizing DRL-based algorithms in parallel settings. We validate an existing state-of-the-art DRL framework used for AFC problems and discuss its efficiency bottlenecks. Subsequently, by deconstructing the overall framework and conducting extensive scalability benchmarks for individual components, we investigate various hybrid parallelization configurations and propose efficient parallelization strategies. Moreover, we refine input/output (I/O) operations in multi-environment DRL training to tackle critical overhead associated with data movement. Finally, we demonstrate the optimized framework for a typical AFC problem where near-linear scaling can be obtained for the overall framework. We achieve a significant boost in parallel efficiency from around 49% to approximately 78%, and the training process is accelerated by approximately 47 times using 60 CPU cores. These findings are expected to provide valuable insights for further advancements in DRL-based AFC studies.</description>
