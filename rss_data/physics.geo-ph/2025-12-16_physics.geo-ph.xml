      <title>SoilGen: A Comprehensive Tool for Generating Synthetic Soil Profiles for Geotechnical and Seismic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geotechnical and seismic applications, ranging from site response analysis and HVSR simulations to dispersion curve modeling, increasingly depend on large, well-labeled datasets for robust model development. However, the scarcity of publicly available borehole datasets, coupled with the proprietary nature of high-quality field records, creates a significant bottleneck for data-driven research, particularly in machine learning. To address this limitation, this study introduces SoilGen, an open-source framework that procedurally generates physically consistent multilayer soil columns as synthetic soil profiles. Unlike simple randomization, SoilGen computes a complete suite of geotechnical properties, including layer thickness, shear-wave velocity, P-wave velocity, density, and Poisson ratio, while enforcing physical constraints to ensure realism. The algorithmic foundations of the framework and its implementation are outlined, and its utility is demonstrated through representative near-surface geological scenarios relevant to site characterization and near-surface geophysics. By facilitating the rapid generation of large-scale model libraries exceeding one hundred thousand realizations, SoilGen enables comprehensive parametric studies and the training of deep learning inversion networks that require extensive labeled datasets for shear-wave velocity profiling and related site characterization tasks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Full-waveform Monitoring of CO2 Storage with Fluid-flow Priors via Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative monitoring of subsurface changes is essential for ensuring the safety of geological CO2 sequestration. Full-waveform monitoring (FWM) can resolve these changes at high spatial resolution, but conventional deterministic inversion lacks uncertainty quantification and incorporates only limited prior information. Deterministic approaches can also yield unreliable results with sparse and noisy seismic data. To address these limitations, we develop a Bayesian FWM framework that combines reservoir flow physics with generative prior modeling. Prior CO2 saturation realizations are constructed by performing multiphase flow simulations on prior geological realizations. Seismic velocity is related to saturation through rock physics modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on the priors maps high-dimensional CO2 saturation fields onto a low-dimensional, approximately Gaussian latent space, enabling efficient Bayesian inference while retaining the key geometrical structure of the CO2 plume. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is used to infer CO2 saturation changes from time-lapse seismic data and to quantify associated uncertainties. Numerical results show that this approach improves inversion stability and accuracy under extremely sparse and noisy acquisition, whereas deterministic methods become unreliable. Statistical seismic monitoring provides posterior uncertainty estimates that identify where additional measurements would most reduce ambiguity and mitigate errors arising from biased rock physics parameters. The framework combines reservoir physics, generative priors, and Bayesian inference to provide uncertainty quantification for time-lapse monitoring of CO2 storage and other subsurface processes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-Based Posterior Sampling in Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian full waveform inversion (FWI) offers uncertainty-aware subsurface models; however, posterior sampling directly on observed seismic shot records is rarely practical at the field scale because each sample requires numerous wave-equation solves. We aim to make such sampling feasible for large surveys while preserving calibration, that is, high uncertainty in less illuminated areas. Our approach couples diffusion-based posterior sampling with simultaneous-source FWI data. At each diffusion noise level, a network predicts a clean velocity model. We then apply a stochastic refinement step in model space using Langevin dynamics under the wave-equation likelihood and reintroduce noise to decouple successive levels before proceeding. Simultaneous-source batches reduce forward and adjoint solves approximately in proportion to the supergather size, while an unconditional diffusion prior trained on velocity patches and volumes helps suppress source-related numerical artefacts. We evaluate the method on three 2D synthetic datasets (SEG/EAGE Overthrust, SEG/EAGE Salt, SEAM Arid), a 2D field line, and a 3D upscaling study. Relative to a particle-based variational baseline, namely Stein variational gradient descent without a learned prior and with single-source (non-simultaneous-source) FWI, our sampler achieves lower model error and better data fit at a substantially reduced computational cost. By aligning encoded-shot likelihoods with diffusion-based sampling and exploiting straightforward parallelization over samples and source batches, the method provides a practical path to calibrated posterior inference on observed shot records that scales to large 2D and 3D problems.</description>

      <title>The EEPAS Model Revisited: Statistical Formalism and a High-Performance, Reproducible Open-Source Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While short-term models such as the Short-Term Earthquake Probability (STEP) and Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) are well established and supported by open-source software, medium- to long-term models, notably the Every Earthquake a Precursor According to Scale (EEPAS) and Proximity to Past Earthquakes (PPE), remain under-documented and largely inaccessible. Despite outperforming time-invariant models in regional studies, their mathematical foundations are often insufficiently formalized. This study addresses these gaps by formally deriving the EEPAS and PPE models within the framework of inhomogeneous Poisson point processes and clarifying the connection between empirical $\Psi$-scaling regressions and likelihood-based inference. We introduce a fully automated, open-source Python implementation of EEPAS that combines analytical modeling with Numba JIT acceleration, NumPy vectorization, and joblib parallelization, all configured via modular JSON files for usability and reproducibility. Integration with pyCSEP enables standardized evaluation and comparison. When applied to the Italy HORUS dataset, our system reproduces published results within one hour using identical initialization settings. It also provides a comprehensive pipeline from raw catalog to parameter estimation, achieving improved log-likelihoods and passing strict consistency tests without manual $\Psi$ identification. We position our framework as part of a growing open-source ecosystem for seismological research that spans the full workflow from data acquisition to forecast evaluation. Our framework fills a key gap in this ecosystem by providing robust tools for medium- to long-term statistical modeling of earthquake catalogs, which is an essential but underserved component in probabilistic seismic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear seismic amplitude versus offset inversion using the exact Zoeppritz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude-variation-with-offset inversion techniques are formulated to estimate elastic properties by fitting modeled seismic responses to observed data. Solving inverse seismic problems requires minimizing a target objective function for which gradient-based methods are frequently adopted. However, the efficiency and accuracy of these methods depend significantly on the approach used to compute the gradient of the target function. This work presents an explicit analytical gradient formulation of the exact Zoeppritz equation, discretized for multilayer media and derived using the adjoint-state method. The resulting expressions provide the gradient of a convolution-based objective function with respect to P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, and density. The adjoint state-based solution improves computational efficiency by avoiding numerical approximations while maintaining high accuracy in calculating the gradient for seismic inversion. Additionally, using the exact Zoeppritz equation helps overcome the limitations associated with weak elastic property contrasts across subsurface layers. The least squares target function is minimized using a nonlinear limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical gradient solution of the exact Zoeppritz equations in seismic inversion problems involving P-wave and S-wave velocity and density models. The inversion methodology is validated using 1D well logs-based and 2D synthetic seismic data with varying noise levels. Then it is applied to a 2D field data set from the Troll oil and gas field in the Norwegian North Sea. The results demonstrate that the proposed inversion framework provides stable and reliable estimates of elastic property models.</description>

      <title>Assessment Of Selected Trace Elements Concentration in Eleyele Lake-Water, Ibadan South Western Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eleyele Lake has enormous economic importance as it is completely surrounded by various communities which discharge their domestic waste directly into the lake. This alters the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the lake. It is essential to assess the water for its various usage. Twelve (12) samples were collected from various locations of the lake and analysed. Some physical parameters (electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids, Ph and temperature were determined in-situ. The rest of the sample was taken to the laboratory for various chemical analysis and the results were compared to the WHO standards. The chemical extent of the contamination was determined by the contamination factor, degree of contamination and Geo-Accumulation Index. The physical parameters show that the TDS has an average of 122.2ppm and EC was uniform throughout the various points of reading suggesting that the lake is fresh water. The pH averaged at 72, temperature at 27.2 degrees. The selected trace element falls within the WHO acceptable limits. Their contamination indices showed that Ba, Co, Cs, Cu, Mo, Rb, Sr and Zn are generally less than one depicting their geogenic origin. The high degree of contamination is influenced by high levels of Al and Fe due to human activities and industrial waste disposal and can lead to anemia, osteomalacia (brittle or soft bones), cardiac arrest, stomach problems, nausea, and hemochromatosis. Thus, Eleyele lake is not advisable for consumption.</description>

      <title>MicroPhaseNO: Adapting an Earthquake-Trained Phase Neural Operator for Microseismic Phase Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic phase picking is very often used for microseismic monitoring and subsurface imaging. Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing bias and pick uncertainty. Because the adaptation relies on a small, campaign-specific calibration set, the approach is readily transferable to other microseismic tasks where public earthquake data and pre-trained models are accessible. The associated code will be released openly at https://github.com/ayratabd/MicroPhaseNO.</description>

      <title>Enhancing lithological interpretation from petrophysical well log of IODP expedition 390/393 using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced lithological interpretation from well logs plays a key role in geological resource exploration and mapping, as well as in geo-environmental modeling studies. Core and cutting information is useful for making sound interpretations of well logs; however, these are rarely collected at each depth due to high costs. Moreover, well log interpretation using traditional methods is constrained by poor borehole conditions. Traditional statistical methods are mostly linear, often failing to discriminate between lithology and rock facies, particularly when dealing with overlapping well log signals characterized by the structural and compositional variation of rock types. In this study, we develop multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to jointly analyze multivariate well log data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expeditions 390 and 393 for enhanced lithological interpretations. Among the algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network models, the Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 0.9950 and an F1-score of 0.9951. While unsupervised machine learning (ML) provides the foundation for cluster information that inherently supports the classification algorithm, supervised ML is applied to devise a data-driven lithology clustering mechanism for IODP datasets. The joint ML-based method developed here has the potential to be further explored for analyzing other well log datasets from the world's oceans.</description>

      <title>Correcting exponentiality test for binned earthquake magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theory, earthquake magnitudes follow an exponential distribution. In practice, however, earthquake catalogs report magnitudes with finite resolution, resulting in a discrete (geometric) distribution. To determine the lowest magnitude above which seismic events are completely recorded, the Lilliefors test is commonly applied. Because this test assumes continuous data, it is standard practice to add uniform noise to binned magnitudes prior to testing exponentiality.
  This work shows analytically that uniform dithering cannot recover the exponential distribution from its geometric form. It instead returns a piecewise-constant residual lifetime distribution, whose deviation from the exponential model becomes detectable as catalog size or bin width increases. Numerical experiments confirm that this deviation yields an overestimation of the magnitude of completeness in large catalogs.
  We therefore derive the exact noise distribution - a truncated exponential on the bin interval - that correctly restores the continuous exponential distribution over the whole magnitude range. Numerical tests show that this correction yields Lilliefors rejection rates consistent with the significance level for all bin widths and catalog sizes. The proposed solution eliminates a methodological bias in completeness estimation, which especially impacts high-resolution catalogs.</description>

      <title>HydroDiffusion: Diffusion-Based Probabilistic Streamflow Forecasting with a State Space Backbone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have introduced diffusion models for probabilistic streamflow forecasting, demonstrating strong early flood-warning skill. However, current implementations rely on recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) backbones and single-step training objectives, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies and produce coherent forecast trajectories across lead times. To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales.</description>

      <title>Considerations of Earth climate sensitivity based on peculiarities of planetary heat capacity using system identification method: Runaway greenhouse effect scenario is still possible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System identification method (SIM) was used to evaluate the Earth equilibrium climate sensitivity. According to our simulations, the equilibrium climate sensitivity was found to be between 2 deg C and 7 deg C. Analysis of the changes in heat inventory of oceans, atmosphere, land, and cryosphere was based on the experimental data of IPCC6.
  The equation derived for Earth's global surface temperature (GST) shows that the sum of the dimensionless feedback coefficients from water vapor, methane, and Earth albedo could be less than 1. However, due to the positive feedback from carbon dioxide (the combined greenhouse catastrophe) and the revised equilibrium climate sensitivity estimate based on an increase in equilibrium climate sensitivity, the probability of the runaway greenhouse effect increases significantly. It is still less than the critical number when not considering the feedback associated with carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane buildup in Earth's atmosphere.
  The analysis considers the thermal dynamics of the oceans and other factors, including the exponential growth of the Earth's global temperature based on IPCC6 data.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Land Model Reveals Global Environmental Controls on Ecological Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do ecosystems primarily reflect evolutionary history or current environment? Predicting land-atmosphere exchange hinges on this unresolved question. Plant traits adapt to particular environments over evolutionary timescales, yet their individual relationships with current climate and soils are often obscured by limited sampling, plant-type effects, and multiple adaptive strategies that can yield similar outcomes. Crucially, it is the coordination of traits, rather than any single trait, that governs vegetation dynamics and ecosystem fluxes, yet such multivariate relationships cannot be directly observed. We present DifferLand, a differentiable hybrid model that integrates process understanding with machine learning to uncover latent trait-environment relationships from global satellite and in-situ observations (2001-2023). DifferLand explains up to 88% of the variance in canopy structure, photosynthesis, and carbon exchange by learning latent ecological axes-leaf economics, plant stature, and cropland distribution-that link long-term adaptation with short-term dynamics. Interpretable machine learning shows that these coordinated axes emerge from nonlinear interactions between plant-type attributes and local environment. Embedding such relationships into terrestrial models establishes a pathway toward adaptive models that better predict ecosystem resilience under climate change.</description>

      <title>Major Space Weather Risks Identified via Coupled Physics-Engineering-Economic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space weather poses an important but under-quantified threat to critical infrastructure, the economy, and society. While extreme geomagnetic storms are recognized as potential global catastrophes, their socio-economic impacts remain poorly quantified. Here we present a novel physics-engineering-economic framework that links geophysical drivers of geomagnetic storms to power grid geoelectric fields, transformer vulnerability, and macroeconomic consequences. Using the United States as an example, we estimate daily economic losses from transformer thermal heating of 1.37 billion USD (95 percent confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.58 billion USD) for a 100-year geomagnetic storm, with power outages affecting 4.1 million people and 101,000 businesses. A 250-year event could raise losses to 2.09 billion USD per day (95 percent confidence interval: 1.84 to 2.34 billion USD), disrupting power for more than 6 million people and 155,000 businesses. Crucially, the framework is scalable and transferable, offering a template for assessing space weather risk to critical infrastructure in other countries. This integrative approach provides the first end-to-end quantification of space weather socio-economic impacts, bridging space physics through to policy-relevant metrics. Our results demonstrate that coupled socio-economic modeling of space weather is both feasible and essential, enabling evidence-based decision making in infrastructure protection and global risk management.</description>

      <title>Active Protothrusts and Fluid Highways: Seismic Noise Reveals Hidden Subduction Dynamics in Cascadia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex interactions between strain accumulation, fault slip, and fluid migration influence shallow subduction zone dynamics. Using a decade of continuous ambient seismic data from Cascadia seafloor observatories, we identified distinct regional variations in subduction dynamics. Northern Cascadia exhibits a fully locked megathrust with persistent strain accumulation, while central Cascadia displays a slow slip event on protothrusts and rapid fluid migration along fault systems in the overriding plate. Effective fluid transport through the decollement and the Alvin Canyon Fault likely modulates the earthquake behavior but does not cause slow slip events on the megathrust and likely stabilizes large earthquakes, promoting rupture arrest.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.</description>
