      <title>Indiscernible extraction at small large cardinals from a higher-arity stability notion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a higher-arity stability notion defined in terms of $k$-splitting, a higher-arity generalization of splitting. We show that theories with bounded $k$-splitting have improved indiscernible extraction at $k$-ineffable cardinals, and we give a non-trivial example of a theory with bounded $k$-splitting but unbounded $(k-1)$-splitting for each odd $k &gt; 1$. We also show that bounded $k$-splitting implies $\mathrm{NFOP}_k$, a higher arity stability notion introduced by Terry and Wolf. We then use our indiscernible extraction result together with a construction of Kaplan and Shelah to give a strong counterexample to the converse: an $\mathrm{NIP}$ theory with unbounded $k$-splitting for every $k$. Finally, as a thematically related but technically independent result, we show that treelessness implies $\mathrm{NFOP}_2$, sharpening a result of Kaplan, Ramsey, and Simon.</description>

      <title>Fields with Lie-commuting and iterative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for studying fields equipped with operators, given as co-ordinate functions of homomorphisms into a local algebra $\mathcal{D}$, satisfying various compatibility conditions that we denote by $\Gamma$ and call such structures $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-fields. These include Lie-commutativity of derivations and $\mathfrak g$-iterativity of (truncated) Hasse-Schmidt derivations. Our main result is about the existence of principal realisations of $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-kernels. As an application, we prove companionability of the theory of $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-fields and denote the companion by $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-CF. In characteristic zero, we prove that $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-CF is a stable theory that satisfies the CBP and Zilber's dichotomy for finite-dimensional types. We also prove that there is a uniform companion for model-complete theories of large $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-fields, which leads to the notion of $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-large fields and we further use this to show that PAC substructures of $\mathcal{D}^{\Gamma}$-DCF are elementary.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence, robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating swarm.</description>

      <title>Counting rational points on transcendental curves in valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on the number of rational points on transcendental curves in arbitrary $1$-h-minimal fields, similar to the Pila--Wilkie counting theorem in the o-minimal setting. These results extend results due to Cluckers--Comte--Loeser from $p$-adic fields to arbitrary valued fields of mixed characteristic. Our methods rely on parametrizations, where we avoid the usage of $r$-th power maps, combined with the determinant method.</description>

      <title>When is the \'etale open topology a field topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02398v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following question: Given a field $K$, when is the \'etale open topology $\mathcal{E}_K$ induced by a field topology? On the positive side, when $K$ is the fraction field of a local domain $R\neq K$, using a weak form of resolution of singularities due to Gabber, we show that $\mathcal{E}_K$ agrees with the $R$-adic topology when $R$ is quasi-excellent and henselian. Various pathologies appear when dropping the quasi-excellence assumption. For locally bounded field topologies, we introduce the notion of generalized t-henselianity (gt-henselianity) following Prestel and Ziegler. We establish the following: For a locally bounded field topology $\tau$, the \'etale open topology is induced by $\tau$ if and only if $\tau$ is gt-henselian and some non-empty \'etale image is $\tau$-bounded open. On the negative side, we obtain that for a pseudo-algebraically closed field $K$, $\mathcal{E}_K$ is never induced by a field topology.</description>

      <title>Quasianalytic algebras with weakly smooth germs generate o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1303.3724, the authors provide an axiomatic way of constructing new polynomially bounded o-minimal structures. However, all of the structures satisfying these axioms must also have smooth cell-decomposition. In this paper, we generalize their approach by allowing weakly smooth germs into the construction. In particular, we showed in arXiv:2501.17583 that the o-minimal structure constructed in [O. Le Gal, J.-P. Rolin. "An o-minimal structure which does not admit $C^\infty$ cellular decomposition" Ann. Inst. Fourier 59 (2009), pp 543-562] satisfies the assumptions of our theorem. As an application of our result, we show that there exists an o-minimal structure within which we can define a nowhere smooth function.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of NF via Fuzzy Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14400v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof of the consistency of the \emph{New Foundations} set theory ($\mathit{NF}$). $\mathit{NF}$'s main idea is to permit very large sets (including the Universal Set) by restricting set formation to stratified formulas, thereby avoiding the classic set-theoretic paradoxes. Our proof employs a new forcing method incorporating concepts from fuzzy logic. A brief outline of the proof can be as follows: (1) We extend $ZF$ to \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{ZF}$ with a membership function $\mu$ over $D=\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$; (2) we define \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{NF}$ as $\Sigma$, and (3) we derive a crisp $\mathrm{N}$ model of $NF$. Our proof does not depend on Holmes' Tangled Type Theory ($\mathit{TTT}$). It establishes that if $\mathit{ZF}$ is consistent, then $\mathit{NF}$ is also consistent. It achieves that via the chain $\mathit{ZF} \rightarrow$ \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{ZF} \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mathit{NF}$. The method presented in this paper offers a novel perspective connecting fuzzy logic with classic set theory.</description>

      <title>Projective length, phantom extensions, and the structure of torsion modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of phantom extension of order a given ordinal $\alpha $ has been introduced in collaboration with Casarosa, as an algebraic analogue of the order of a phantom map in topology, to study the structure of flat modules. In this companion paper we characterize phantom extension of \emph{torsion} modules over a countable Dedekind domain $R$. After localizing, one can assume that $R$ is a discrete valuation domain with maximal ideal generated by $p\in R$. In this case, the phantom extensions of order $\alpha $ of a countable torsion module are precisely the $p^{\omega \left( 1+\alpha\right) }$-pure extensions introduced by Nunke in the 1960s. A module has projective length at most $\alpha $ if and only if it is a projective object with respect to the exact structure defined by phantom extensions of order $\alpha $. We prove that a countable torsion module has projective length at most $\alpha $ if and only if it is reduced and has Ulm length at most $1+\alpha $, if and only if it is the colimit of a presheaf of finite torsion modules over a countable well-founded forest of rank at most $1+\alpha $.</description>
