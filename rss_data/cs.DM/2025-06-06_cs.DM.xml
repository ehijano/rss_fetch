      <title>An Expansion-Based Approach for Quantified Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore, the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.</description>

      <title>Temporal passing network in basketball: the effect of time pressure on the dynamics of team organization at micro and meso levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, basketball teams are conceptualized as complex adaptive systems to examine their (re)organizational processes in response the time remaining to shoot. Using temporal passing networks to model team behavior, the focus is on the dynamics of the temporal patterns of interaction between players. Several metrics grounded in social network analysis are calculated at different level to assess the dynamics of the patterns used by teams and of the individual roles within those patterns. The results reveal a 3-phase dynamic, differentiated by more or less complex and diversified patterns, and by more or less specialized or flexible roles. Additionally, time-dependent features of the different tactical playing positions are identified, some of which linked to team performance. The findings are intended to explain how basketball teams adapt their organization to cope with time pressure, offering potential insights for other type of teams facing similar constraints. Moreover, this work provides a useful framework for a multilevel understanding of how constraints shape team adaptations dynamically, making it applicable to a wide range of team settings.</description>

      <title>Rumors on evolving graphs through stationary times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rumor spreading in dynamic random graphs. Starting with a single informed vertex, the information flows until it reaches all the vertices of the graph (completion), according to the following process. At each step $k$, the information is propagated to neighbors of the informed vertices, in the $k$-th generated random graph. The way this information propagates from vertex to vertex at each step will depend on the ``protocol". We provide a method based on strong stationary times to study the completion time when the graphs are Markovian time dependent, using known results of the literature for independent graphs. The concept of strong stationary times is then extended to non-Markovian Dynamics using coupling from the past algorithms. This allows to extend results on completion times for non-Markov dynamics</description>

      <title>Decomposing Words for Enhanced Compression: Exploring the Number of Runs in the Extended Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a fundamental component in many data structures for text indexing and compression, widely used in areas such as bioinformatics and information retrieval. The extended BWT (eBWT) generalizes the classical BWT to multisets of strings, providing a flexible framework that captures many BWT-like constructions. Several known variants of the BWT can be viewed as instances of the eBWT applied to specific decompositions of a word. A central property of the BWT, essential for its compressibility, is the number of maximal ranges of equal letters, named runs. In this article, we explore how different decompositions of a word impact the number of runs in the resulting eBWT. First, we show that the number of decompositions of a word is exponential, even under minimal constraints on the size of the subsets in the decomposition. Second, we present an infinite family of words for which the ratio of the number of runs between the worst and best decompositions is unbounded, under the same minimal constraints. These results illustrate the potential cost of decomposition choices in eBWT-based compression and underline the challenges in optimizing run-length encoding in generalized BWT frameworks.</description>
