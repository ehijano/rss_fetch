      <title>Rethinking Boundary Detection in Deep Learning-Based Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal task within the realms of medical image analysis and computer vision. While current methods have shown promise in accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that CTO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on these datasets while maintaining competitive model complexity. The codes have been released at: https://github.com/xiaofang007/CTO.</description>

      <title>EvEnhancer: Empowering Effectiveness, Efficiency and Generalizability for Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) endeavors to upscale videos simultaneously at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, which has recently garnered increasing interest. However, prevailing methods struggle to yield satisfactory videos at out-of-distribution spatial and temporal scales. On the other hand, event streams characterized by high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, exhibit compelling promise in vision tasks. This paper presents EvEnhancer, an innovative approach that marries the unique advantages of event streams to elevate effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability for C-STVSR. Our approach hinges on two pivotal components: 1) Event-adapted synthesis capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and events to discern and learn long-term motion trajectories, enabling the adaptive interpolation and fusion of informative spatiotemporal features; 2) Local implicit video transformer integrates local implicit video neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous video representations utilized to generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions and frame rates. Experiments show that EvEnhancer achieves superiority on synthetic and real-world datasets and preferable generalizability on out-of-distribution scales against state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Cross-organ all-in-one parallel compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based parallel compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (p-CSMRI) have significantly improved reconstruction quality. However, current p-CSMRI methods often require training separate deep neural network (DNN) for each organ due to anatomical variations, creating a barrier to developing generalized medical image reconstruction systems. To address this, we propose CAPNet (cross-organ all-in-one deep unfolding p-CSMRI network), a unified framework that implements a p-CSMRI iterative algorithm via three specialized modules: auxiliary variable module, prior module, and data consistency module. Recognizing that p-CSMRI systems often employ varying sampling ratios for different organs, resulting in organ-specific artifact patterns, we introduce an artifact generation submodule, which extracts and integrates artifact features into the data consistency module to enhance the discriminative capability of the overall network. For the prior module, we design an organ structure-prompt generation submodule that leverages structural features extracted from the segment anything model (SAM) to create cross-organ prompts. These prompts are strategically incorporated into the prior module through an organ structure-aware Mamba submodule. Comprehensive evaluations on a cross-organ dataset confirm that CAPNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across multiple anatomical structures using a single unified model. Our code will be published at https://github.com/shibaoshun/CAPNet.</description>

      <title>Advancing 3D Medical Image Segmentation: Unleashing the Potential of Planarian Neural Networks in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of 3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Advanced 3D Imaging Approach to TSV/TGV Metrology and Inspection Using Only Optical Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to silicon and glass via inspection, which combines hybrid field microscopy with photometric stereo. Conventional optical microscopy techniques are generally limited to superficial inspections and struggle to effectively visualize the internal structures of silicon and glass vias. By utilizing various lighting conditions for 3D reconstruction, the proposed method surpasses these limitations. By integrating photometric stereo to the traditional optical microscopy, the proposed method not only enhances the capability to detect micro-scale defects but also provides a detailed visualization of depth and edge abnormality, which are typically not visible with conventional optical microscopy inspection. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method effectively captures intricate surface details and internal structures. Quantitative comparisons between the reconstructed models and actual measurements present the capability of the proposed method to significantly improve silicon and glass via inspection process. As a result, the proposed method achieves enhanced cost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy and repeatability, suggesting substantial advancements in silicon and glass via inspection techniques</description>

      <title>MoRe-3DGSMR: Motion-resolved reconstruction framework for free-breathing pulmonary MRI based on 3D Gaussian representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised, motion-resolved reconstruction framework for high-resolution, free-breathing pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing a three-dimensional Gaussian representation (3DGS). The proposed method leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic pulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for continuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed using a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion signals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the estimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory phases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image volume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector fields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through spatial transformation of the reference volume. The proposed reconstruction pipeline is evaluated on six datasets from six subjects and bench-marked against three state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction framework effectively reconstructs high-resolution, motion-resolved pulmonary MR images. Compared with existing approaches, it achieves superior image quality, reflected by higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proposed unsupervised 3DGS-based reconstruction method enables accurate motion-resolved pulmonary MRI with isotropic spatial resolution. Its superior performance in image quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods highlights its potential as a robust solution for clinical pulmonary MR imaging.</description>

      <title>ADNP-15: An Open-Source Histopathological Dataset for Neuritic Plaque Segmentation in Human Brain Whole Slide Images with Frequency Domain Image Enhancement for Stain Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, which serve as key histopathological features. The identification and segmentation of these lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy Measurements without Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.</description>

      <title>RepSNet: A Nucleus Instance Segmentation model based on Boundary Regression and Structural Re-parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, and nucleus instance segmentation is a key step in digital pathology analysis and pathological diagnosis. However, the computational efficiency of the model and the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&amp;E-stained histopathological images. First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore, different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to several typical benchmark models.</description>

      <title>MDAA-Diff: CT-Guided Multi-Dose Adaptive Attention Diffusion Model for PET Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks. Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Improved Brain Tumor Detection in MRI: Fuzzy Sigmoid Convolution in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential to improving patient outcomes. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection has shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization, which limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution (FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the receptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient feature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In the FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based architecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89% on three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than large-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational efficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early. This research offers lightweight, high-performance deep-learning models for medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>White Light Specular Reflection Data Augmentation for Deep Learning Polyp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for the patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution. However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in polyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new data augmentation method.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Ophthalmology Foundation Models for Clinically Significant Age Macular Degeneration Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</description>

      <title>Augmented Deep Contexts for Spatially Embedded Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts. Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.</description>

      <title>OcularAge: A Comparative Study of Iris and Periocular Images for Pediatric Age Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating a child's age from ocular biometric images is challenging due to subtle physiological changes and the limited availability of longitudinal datasets. Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288 pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10 milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their suitability for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>SSH-Net: A Self-Supervised and Hybrid Network for Noisy Image Watermark Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible watermark removal is challenging due to its inherent complexities and the noise carried within images. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised learning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and watermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and Hybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net synthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in a self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task. The upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a lightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle the more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise, incorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture intricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared CNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common features that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wenyang001/SSH-Net.</description>

      <title>Joint Super-Resolution and Segmentation for 1-m Impervious Surface Area Mapping in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel joint framework by integrating super-resolution and segmentation, called JointSeg, which enables the generation of 1-meter ISA maps directly from freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. JointSeg was trained on multimodal cross-resolution inputs, offering a scalable and affordable alternative to traditional approaches. This synergistic design enables gradual resolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial textures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective cross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex urban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA mapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area of over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m ESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an F1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by 9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%. In densely urbanized areas (e.g., Suzhou, Nanjing), ISA-1 reduces ISA overestimation through improved discrimination of green spaces and water bodies. Conversely, in mountainous regions (e.g., Ganzi, Zhaotong), it identifies significantly more ISA due to its enhanced ability to detect fragmented anthropogenic features such as rural roads and sparse settlements, demonstrating its robustness across diverse landscapes. Moreover, we present biennial ISA maps from 2017 to 2023, capturing spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics across representative cities. The results highlight distinct regional growth patterns: rapid expansion in upstream cities, moderate growth in midstream regions, and saturation in downstream metropolitan areas.</description>

      <title>An automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for lung cancer diagnosis by detecting and classifying the lung nodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liver cirrhosis represents the end stage of chronic liver disease, characterized by extensive fibrosis and nodular regeneration that significantly increases mortality risk. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive assessment, accurately segmenting cirrhotic livers presents substantial challenges due to morphological alterations and heterogeneous signal characteristics. Deep learning approaches show promise for automating these tasks, but progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, annotated datasets. Here, we present CirrMRI600+, the first comprehensive dataset comprising 628 high-resolution abdominal MRI scans (310 T1-weighted and 318 T2-weighted sequences, totaling nearly 40,000 annotated slices) with expert-validated segmentation labels for cirrhotic livers. The dataset includes demographic information, clinical parameters, and histopathological validation where available. Additionally, we provide benchmark results from 11 state-of-the-art deep learning experiments to establish performance standards. CirrMRI600+ enables the development and validation of advanced computational methods for cirrhotic liver analysis, potentially accelerating progress toward automated Cirrhosis visual staging and personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>AirMorph: Topology-Preserving Deep Learning for Pulmonary Airway Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate anatomical labeling and analysis of the pulmonary structure and its surrounding anatomy from thoracic CT is getting increasingly important for understanding the etilogy of abnormalities or supporting targetted therapy and early interventions. Whilst lung and airway cell atlases have been attempted, there is a lack of fine-grained morphological atlases that are clinically deployable. In this work, we introduce AirMorph, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions that can be used to create digital atlases of the lung. Evaluated across large-scale multi-center datasets comprising diverse pulmonary conditions, the AirMorph consistently outperformed existing segmentation and labeling methods in terms of accuracy, topological consistency, and completeness. To simplify clinical interpretation, we further introduce a compact anatomical signature quantifying critical morphological airway features, including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. When applied to various pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation, and reticular opacities, it demonstrates strong discriminative power, revealing disease-specific morphological patterns with high interpretability and explainability. Additionally, AirMorph supports efficient automated branching pattern analysis, potentially enhancing bronchoscopic navigation planning and procedural safety, offering a valuable clinical tool for improved diagnosis, targeted treatment, and personalized patient care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</description>

      <title>Integrating AI for Human-Centric Breast Cancer Diagnostics: A Multi-Scale and Multi-View Swin Transformer Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Depth Maps and Attention Mechanisms for Enhanced Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing deep learning-based image inpainting methods typically rely on convolutional networks with RGB images to reconstruct images. However, relying exclusively on RGB images may neglect important depth information, which plays a critical role in understanding the spatial and structural context of a scene. Just as human vision leverages stereo cues to perceive depth, incorporating depth maps into the inpainting process can enhance the model's ability to reconstruct images with greater accuracy and contextual awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates both RGB and depth images for enhanced image inpainting. Our models employ a dual encoder architecture, where one encoder processes the RGB image and the other handles the depth image. The encoded features from both encoders are then fused in the decoder using an attention mechanism, effectively integrating the RGB and depth representations. We use two different masking strategies, line and square, to test the robustness of the model under different types of occlusions. To further analyze the effectiveness of our approach, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations to examine the regions of interest the model focuses on during inpainting. We show that incorporating depth information alongside the RGB image significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the depth-integrated model outperforms the baseline, with attention mechanisms further enhancing inpainting performance, as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics and visualization.</description>

Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.</description>

Abstract: Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor cardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.</description>

      <title>HESSO: Towards Automatic Efficient and User Friendly Any Neural Network Training and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09085</link>

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the most popular approaches to effectively compress the heavy deep neural networks (DNNs) into compact sub-networks while retaining performance. The existing methods suffer from multi-stage procedures along with significant engineering efforts and human expertise. The Only-Train-Once (OTO) series has been recently proposed to resolve the many pain points by streamlining the workflow by automatically conducting (i) search space generation, (ii) structured sparse optimization, and (iii) sub-network construction. However, the built-in sparse optimizers in the OTO series, i.e., the Half-Space Projected Gradient (HSPG) family, have limitations that require hyper-parameter tuning and the implicit controls of the sparsity exploration, consequently requires intervening by human expertise. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Efficient Structured Sparse Optimizer (HESSO). HESSO could automatically and efficiently train a DNN to produce a high-performing subnetwork. Meanwhile, it is almost tuning-free and enjoys user-friendly integration for generic training applications. To address another common issue of irreversible performance collapse observed in pruning DNNs, we further propose a Corrective Redundant Identification Cycle (CRIC) for reliably identifying indispensable structures. We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of HESSO and its enhanced version HESSO-CRIC on a variety of applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, including large language model. The numerical results showcase that HESSO can achieve competitive even superior performance to varying state-of-the-arts and support most DNN architectures. Meanwhile, CRIC can effectively prevent the irreversible performance collapse and further enhance the performance of HESSO on certain applications.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</description>

      <title>MaskAttn-UNet: A Mask Attention-Driven Framework for Universal Low-Resolution Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-resolution image segmentation is crucial in real-world applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and large-scale scene understanding, where high-resolution data is often unavailable due to computational constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MaskAttn-UNet, a novel segmentation framework that enhances the traditional U-Net architecture via a mask attention mechanism. Our model selectively emphasizes important regions while suppressing irrelevant backgrounds, thereby improving segmentation accuracy in cluttered and complex scenes. Unlike conventional U-Net variants, MaskAttn-UNet effectively balances local feature extraction with broader contextual awareness, making it particularly well-suited for low-resolution inputs. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets with input images rescaled to 128x128 and demonstrate competitive performance across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. Our results show that MaskAttn-UNet achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods at significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making it an efficient and scalable solution for low-resolution segmentation in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>
