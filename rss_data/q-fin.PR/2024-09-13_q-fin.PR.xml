      <title>American option pricing using generalised stochastic hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to pricing American options using piecewise diffusion Markov processes (PDifMPs), a type of generalised stochastic hybrid system that integrates continuous dynamics with discrete jump processes. Standard models often rely on constant drift and volatility assumptions, which limits their ability to accurately capture the complex and erratic nature of financial markets. By incorporating PDifMPs, our method accounts for sudden market fluctuations, providing a more realistic model of asset price dynamics. We benchmark our approach with the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, both in its original form and modified to include PDifMP asset price trajectories. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our PDifMP-based method not only provides a more accurate reflection of market behaviour but also offers practical advantages in terms of computational efficiency. The results suggest that PDifMPs can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of American options pricing by more closely aligning with the stochastic volatility and jumps observed in real financial markets.</description>

      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCBs) using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercise time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients from the current time to time zero. This process ultimately determines the CCB price. We then apply this pricing method in simulations and evaluate an underpriced strategy: taking long positions in the 10 most undervalued CCBs and rebalancing daily. The results show that this strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark double-low strategy. In practice, CCB issuers often use a downward adjustment clause to prevent financial distress when a put provision is triggered. Therefore, we model the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event that triggers the put provision, thereby integrating it with the put provision in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Pricing Barrier Options with DeepBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.10966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and direct approach to price boundary and final-value problems, corresponding to barrier options, using forward deep learning to solve forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). Barrier instruments are instruments that expire or transform into another instrument if a barrier condition is satisfied before maturity; otherwise they perform like the instrument without the barrier condition. In the PDE formulation, this corresponds to adding boundary conditions to the final value problem. The deep BSDE methods developed so far have not addressed barrier/boundary conditions directly. We extend the forward deep BSDE to the barrier condition case by adding nodes to the computational graph to explicitly monitor the barrier conditions for each realization of the dynamics as well as nodes that preserve the time, state variables, and trading strategy value at barrier breach or at maturity otherwise. Given these additional nodes in the computational graph, the forward loss function quantifies the replication of the barrier or final payoff according to a chosen risk measure such as squared sum of differences. The proposed method can handle any barrier condition in the FBSDE set-up and any Dirichlet boundary conditions in the PDE set-up, both in low and high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>
