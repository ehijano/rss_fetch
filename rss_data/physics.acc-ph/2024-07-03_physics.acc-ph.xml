      <title>Radio-frequency cavity field measurements through free falling bead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel bead-falling measurement method for the precise and efficient mapping of electromagnetic fields within radio-frequency (RF) cavities, which are crucial components in the design of accelerators. The traditional bead-pull method, while effective, involves mechanical complexities and is prone to errors from wire perturbations. The innovative method reported here leverages the simplicity and accuracy of free-falling beads to mitigate these issues. This technique eliminates the need for a wire-pulley system, thereby simplifying the experimental setup and reducing potential mechanical errors. We detail the development and operational principles of this new method, including the design of a compact, portable measurement device that integrates a bead/droplet release system and a bead detection system linked to a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The device has been tested with a three-gap buncher cavity and a scaled Alvarez-type cavity, demonstrating its ability to perform rapid, reliable field measurements under various challenging conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratios and environmental vibrations. The results confirm the method's superiority in precision and operational efficiency, potentially setting a new standard for RF cavity diagnostics and tuning.</description>

      <title>LEEx-B: Low Energy Experimental Bench Development at IPHC-CNRS Strasbourg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a part of future developments of beam diagnostics, a low energy experimental bench (LEEx-B) has been recently designed, built and commissioned at IPHC-CNRS of Strasbourg. The bench is composed of a Cs+ ion gun installed on a HV platform and providing beams up to 25 keV. A beam profiler and an Allison-type emittance-meter allow the qualification of the setup and also the characterization of the beam. During the commissioning process, the electronics, and the control system were upgraded in order to push the limits towards low beam currents measured by the emittance-meter.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of dark current from an S-band rf gun with exchangeable photocathode system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field emission or dark current from RF electron guns is problematic for accelerators for several reasons, and can be more difficult to predict, measure and understand, compared to the main beam. The work presented here is a study of the dark current emitted from the CLARA 3GHz 2.5 cell electron gun with exchangeable photocathode, which is a type of gun used for single pass high quality low emittance beams for uses such as Free Electron Lasers. The main purpose of these studies was to identify sources of dark current emission within the gun, by examining the dark current distribution and patterns on scintillating screens. It is shown that the features of the patterns can be reproduced qualitatively, and to some extent quantitatively, by finite element simulations. Thus, certain surfaces within the gun and cathode apparatus which contribute most significantly to problematic dark current can be identified, and further development and preparation of the guns and their cathodes can be informed to minimise dark current.</description>

      <title>Self-Cancelation of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation Kicks Using a Non-Symmetric S-shape Four-Bend Chicane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High peak current electron beams are essential for x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), and generally realized through multi-stage compression with symmetric C-shape four-bend chicanes. However, the coherent synchrotron radiations (CSR), emitted for wavelengths longer than or comparable to the length of the electron bunch during the compression, may degrade the beam quality and finally affect the FEL performance. In this Letter, we show that zero net CSR kick cannot be achieved in a symmetric C-chicane by using an explicit point-kick analysis of the CSR effects, which is responsible for significant emittance growth when pursuing a peak current of $\gtrsim$ 10 kiloamperes. A four-bend chicane with non-symmetric S-shape geometry that can self-cancel the CSR kicks is proposed to effectively suppress the emittance growth. Compared to the symmetric C-chicane, beams with three times higher peak current and similar emittance growth can be achieved with the S-chicane for typical FEL operation parameters. We believe that this study provides a viable way of producing high quality and short intense electron beams, benefiting future development of FELs and other types of accelerator-based scientific facilities.</description>
