      <title>Game of grounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to connect Prawitz's theory of grounds with Girard's Ludics. This connection is carried out on two levels. On a more philosophical one, we highlight some differences between Prawitz's and Girard's approaches, but we also argue that they share some basic ideas about proofs and deduction. On a more formal one, we sketch an indicative translation of Prawitz's theory grounds into Girard's Ludics relative to the implicational fragment of propositional intuitionistic logic. This may allow for a dialogical reading of Prawitz's ground-theoretic approach. Moreover, it becomes possible to provide a formal definition of a notion of ground-candidate introduced by Cozzo.</description>

      <title>Abstract computation over first-order structures. Part I: Deterministic and non-deterministic BSS RAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most ideas about what an algorithm is are very similar. Basic operations are used for transforming objects. The evaluation of internal and external states by relations has impact on the further process. A more precise definition can lead to a model of abstract computation over an arbitrary first-order structure. Formally, the algorithms can be determined by strings. Their meaning can be described purely mathematically by functions and relations derived from the operations and relations of a first-order structure. Our model includes models of computability and derivation systems from different areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science. To define the algorithms, we use so-called programs. Since we do this independently of their executability by computers, the so-called execution of our programs can be viewed as a form of abstract computation. This concept helps to highlight common features of algorithms that are independent of the underlying structures. Here, in Part I, we define BSS RAMs step by step. In Part II, we study Moschovakis' operator which is known from a general recursion theory over first-order structures. Later, we study hierarchies defined analogously to the arithmetical hierarchy by means of quantified formulas of an infinitary logic in this framework.</description>

      <title>Generalization of terms via universal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new foundational approach to the generalization of terms up to equational theories. We interpret generalization problems in a universal-algebraic setting making a key use of projective and exact algebras in the variety associated to the considered equational theory. We prove that the generality poset of a problem and its type (i.e., the cardinality of a complete set of least general solutions) can be studied in this algebraic setting. Moreover, we identify a class of varieties where the study of the generality poset can be fully reduced to the study of the congruence lattice of the 1-generated free algebra. We apply our results to varieties of algebras and to (algebraizable) logics. In particular we obtain several examples of unitary type: abelian groups; commutative monoids and commutative semigroups; all varieties whose 1-generated free algebra is trivial, e.g., lattices, semilattices, varieties without constants whose operations are idempotent; Boolean algebras, Kleene algebras, and G\"odel algebras, which are the equivalent algebraic semantics of, respectively, classical, 3-valued Kleene, and G\"odel-Dummett logic.</description>

      <title>History of Archimedean and non-Archimedean approaches to uniform processes: Uniformity, symmetry, regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Nancy Cartwright's distinction between theories and basic models to explore the history of rival approaches to modeling a notion of chance for an ideal uniform physical process known as a fair spinner. This process admits both Archimedean and non-Archimedean models. Advocates of Archimedean models maintain that the fair spinner should satisfy hypotheses such as invariance with respect to rotations by an arbitrary real angle, and assume that the optimal mathematical tool in this context is the Lebesgue measure. Others argue that invariance with respect to all real rotations does not constitute an essential feature of the underlying physical process, and could be relaxed in favor of regularity. We show that, working in ZFC, no subset of the commonly assumed hypotheses determines a unique model, suggesting that physically based intuitions alone are insufficient to pin down a unique mathematical model. We provide a rebuttal of recent criticisms of non-Archimedean models by Parker and Pruss.</description>
