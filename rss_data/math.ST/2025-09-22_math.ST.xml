      <title>On the convergence rate in the central limit theorem for linearly extended negative quadrant dependent random variables and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the convergence rate in central limit theorem (CLT) for linearly extended negative quadrant dependent (LENQD) random variables (rv's). Under some weak conditions, the rate of normal approximation is shown as $O(n^{-1/9})$. As an application, the convergence rate in CLT of the wavelet estimator for the nonparametric regression model with LENQD errors is presented as $O(n^{-1/9})$. The performance of the main results is illustrated through a simulation study based on a real dataset.</description>

      <title>Direct Estimation of Eigenvalues of Large Dimensional Precision Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider directly estimating the eigenvalues of precision matrix, without inverting the corresponding estimator for the eigenvalues of covariance matrix. We focus on a general asymptotic regime, i.e., the large dimensional regime, where both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $K$ tend to infinity whereas their quotient $N/K$ converges to a positive constant. By utilizing tools from random matrix theory, we construct an improved estimator for eigenvalues of precision matrix. We prove the consistency of the new estimator under large dimensional regime. In order to obtain the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator, we provide a theoretical result that characterizes the convergence rate of the expected Stieltjes transform (with its derivative) of the spectra of the sample covariance matrix. Using this result, we prove that the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator is of order $O(1/K^2)$. Additionally, we establish a central limiting theorem (CLT) to describe the fluctuations of the new estimator. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to validate the excellent performance of the new estimator and to verify the accuracy of the CLT.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the group structure of hypotheses for more powerful multiple testing with FDR control for the filtered rejection set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern biological studies often involve testing many hypotheses organized in a group or a hierarchical structure, such as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In these studies, researchers often wish to control the false discovery rate (FDR) after filtering the discoveries to obtain interpretable results. For addressing this goal, Katsevich, Sabatti, and Bogomolov (2023, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 118(541), 165-176) developed a general method, Focused BH, that guarantees FDR control for the filtered rejection set for a pre-specified filter, under certain assumptions. We propose improving the power of Focused BH by adapting it to group or hierarchical structures of hypotheses using data-dependent weights. The general method incorporating such weights is referred to as Weighted Focused BH (WFBH). For DAG-structured hypotheses, we propose a variant of WFBH, which can gain power by being adaptive to the DAG structure, and by exploiting the logical relationships among the hypotheses. We prove that WFBH with weights that were proposed to adapt the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to different group structures, as well as its proposed variant for testing DAG-structured hypotheses, control the post-filtering FDR under certain assumptions. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the latter variant is robust to deviations from these assumptions and can be considerably more powerful than comparable methods. Finally, we elucidate its practical use by applying it to real datasets from microbiome and gene expression studies.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Average: Distributional Causal Inference under Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of distributional treatment effects in randomized experiments with imperfect compliance. When participants do not adhere to their assigned treatments, we leverage treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to identify the local distributional treatment effect-the difference in outcome distributions between treatment and control groups for the subpopulation of compliers. We propose a regression-adjusted estimator based on a distribution regression framework with Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions, enabling robustness and flexibility with high-dimensional covariates. Our approach accommodates continuous, discrete, and mixed discrete-continuous outcomes, and applies under a broad class of covariate-adaptive randomization schemes, including stratified block designs and simple random sampling. We derive the estimator's asymptotic distribution and show that it achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. Simulation results demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance, and we demonstrate the method's practical relevance in an application to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions from statistical physics postulate that recovery of the communities in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. This conjecture has given rise to a rich literature, proving that non-trivial community recovery is indeed possible in SBM above the KS threshold, as long as the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the observed graph. Failure of low-degree polynomials below the KS threshold was also proven when $K=o(\sqrt{n})$.
  When $K\geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin et al.(2025) recently prove that, in a sparse regime, community recovery in polynomial time is possible below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This breakthrough result lead them to postulate a new threshold for the many communities regime $K\geq \sqrt{n}$. In this work, we provide evidences that confirm their conjecture for $K\geq \sqrt{n}$:
  1- We prove that, for any density of the graph, low-degree polynomials fail to recover communities below the threshold postulated by Chin et al.(2025);
  2- We prove that community recovery is possible in polynomial time above the postulated threshold, not only in the sparse regime of~Chin et al., but also in some (but not all) moderately sparse regimes by essentially counting clique occurence in the observed graph.</description>

      <title>What is a good matching of probability measures? A counterfactual lens on transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling probability measures lies at the core of many problems in statistics and machine learning, from domain adaptation to transfer learning and causal inference. Yet, even when restricted to deterministic transports, such couplings are not identifiable: two atomless marginals admit infinitely many transport maps. The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost minimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct notions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first carry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps: cyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their equivalence, thereby clarifying their respective structural properties. In parallel, we formulate counterfactual reasoning within the framework of structural causal models as a problem of selecting transport maps between fixed marginals, which makes explicit the role of untestable assumptions in counterfactual reasoning. Then, we are able to connect these two perspectives by identifying conditions on causal graphs and structural equations under which counterfactual maps coincide with classical statistical transports. In this way, we delineate the circumstances in which causal assumptions support the use of a specific structure of transport map. Taken together, our results aim to enrich the theoretical understanding of families of transport maps and to clarify their possible causal interpretations. We hope this work contributes to establishing new bridges between statistical transport and causal inference.</description>

      <title>Mixing properties of some Markov chains models in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chains in random environments (MCREs) have recently attracted renewed interest, as these processes naturally arise in many applications, such as econometrics and machine learning. Although specific asymptotic results, such as the law of the large numbers and central limit theorems, have been obtained for some of these models, their annealed dependence properties, such as strong mixing properties, are not well understood in general. We derive strong mixing properties for a wide range of MCREs that satisfy some drift/small set conditions, with general assumptions on the corresponding stochastic parameters and the mixing properties of the environments. We then demonstrate the wide range of applications of our results in time series analysis and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, with fewer restrictions than those found in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Improved learning theory for kernel distribution regression with two-stage sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution regression problem encompasses many important statistics and machine learning tasks, and arises in a large range of applications. Among various existing approaches to tackle this problem, kernel methods have become a method of choice. Indeed, kernel distribution regression is both computationally favorable, and supported by a recent learning theory. This theory also tackles the two-stage sampling setting, where only samples from the input distributions are available. In this paper, we improve the learning theory of kernel distribution regression. We address kernels based on Hilbertian embeddings, that encompass most, if not all, of the existing approaches. We introduce the novel near-unbiased condition on the Hilbertian embeddings, that enables us to provide new error bounds on the effect of the two-stage sampling, thanks to a new analysis. We show that this near-unbiased condition holds for three important classes of kernels, based on optimal transport and mean embedding. As a consequence, we strictly improve the existing convergence rates for these kernels. Our setting and results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Sequence Model: Sample Complexities of Testing, Estimation and LFHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian sequence model, i.e. $X \sim N(\mathbf{\theta}, I_\infty)$, where $\mathbf{\theta} \in \Gamma \subset \ell_2$ is assumed to be convex and compact. We show that goodness-of-fit testing sample complexity is lower bounded by the square-root of the estimation complexity, whenever $\Gamma$ is orthosymmetric. We show that the lower bound is tight when $\Gamma$ is also quadratically convex, thus significantly extending validity of the testing-estimation relationship from [GP24]. Using similar methods, we also completely characterize likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT) complexity for $\ell_p$-bodies, discovering new types of tradeoff between the numbers of simulation and observation samples.</description>

      <title>Measuring agreement among several raters classifying subjects into one or more (hierarchical) categories: A generalization of Fleiss' kappa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cohen's and Fleiss' kappa are well-known measures of inter-rater agreement, but they restrict each rater to selecting only one category per subject. This limitation is consequential in contexts where subjects may belong to multiple categories, such as psychiatric diagnoses involving multiple disorders or classifying interview snippets into multiple codes of a codebook. We propose a generalized version of Fleiss' kappa, which accommodates multiple raters assigning subjects to one or more nominal categories. Our proposed $\kappa$ statistic can incorporate category weights based on their importance and account for hierarchical category structures, such as primary disorders with sub-disorders. The new $\kappa$ statistic can also manage missing data and variations in the number of raters per subject or category. We review existing methods that allow for multiple category assignments and detail the derivation of our measure, proving its equivalence to Fleiss' kappa when raters select a single category per subject. The paper discusses the assumptions, premises, and potential paradoxes of the new measure, as well as the range of possible values and guidelines for interpretation. The measure was developed to investigate the reliability of a new mathematics assessment method, of which an example is elaborated. The paper concludes with a worked-out example of psychiatrists diagnosing patients with multiple disorders. All calculations are provided as R script and an Excel sheet to facilitate access to the new $\kappa$ tatistic.</description>

      <title>Causal inference for the expected number of recurrent events in the presence of a terminal event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recurrent event analyses have been extensively studied, limited attention has been given to causal inference within the framework of recurrent event analysis. We develop a multiply robust estimation framework for causal inference in recurrent event data with a terminal failure event. We define our estimand as the vector comprising both the expected number of recurrent events and the failure survival function evaluated along a sequence of landmark times. We show that the estimand can be identified under a weaker condition than conditionally independent censoring and derive the associated class of influence functions under general censoring and failure distributions (i.e., without assuming absolute continuity). We propose a particular estimator within this class for further study, conduct comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the small-sample performance of our estimator, and illustrate the proposed estimator using a large Medicare dataset to assess the causal effect of PM$_{2.5}$ on recurrent cardiovascular hospitalization.</description>

      <title>BBScoreV2: Learning Time-Evolution and Latent Alignment from Stochastic Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive generative models play a key role in various language tasks, especially for modeling and evaluating long text sequences. While recent methods leverage stochastic representations to better capture sequence dynamics, encoding both temporal and structural dependencies and utilizing such information for evaluation remains challenging. In this work, we observe that fitting transformer-based model embeddings into a stochastic process yields ordered latent representations from originally unordered model outputs. Building on this insight and prior work, we theoretically introduce a novel likelihood-based evaluation metric BBScoreV2. Empirically, we demonstrate that the stochastic latent space induces a "clustered-to-temporal ordered" mapping of language model representations in high-dimensional space, offering both intuitive and quantitative support for the effectiveness of BBScoreV2. Furthermore, this structure aligns with intrinsic properties of natural language and enhances performance on tasks such as temporal consistency evaluation (e.g., Shuffle tasks) and AI-generated content detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is strict normal crossing (SNC) if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of arbitrary Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. The family of these loci forms an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the minimal generators of the bihomogeneous prime ideal that defines this variety.</description>
