      <title>A Primer on Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is a fundamental constituent of the universe, which is needed to explain a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological observations. Although the existence of dark matter was first postulated nearly a century ago and its abundance is precisely measured, approximately five times larger than that of ordinary matter, its underlying identity remains a mystery. A leading hypothesis is that it is composed of new elementary particles, which are predicted to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. In this article we review the basic evidence for dark matter and the role it plays in cosmology and astrophysics, and discuss experimental searches and potential candidates. Rather than targeting researchers in the field, we aim to provide an accessible and concise summary of the most important ideas and results, which can serve as a first entry point for advanced undergraduate students of physics or astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to GW emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within a 4-year observation run, if all dark matter is made up of PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Constrain Spatial Curvature and Dark Energy with Strong Lenses and Complementary Probes: a Forecast for Next-Generation Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring spatial curvature of the Universe with high-fidelity is a longstanding interest in cosmology. However, the strong degeneracy between dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$ and curvature density parameter $\Omega_{\rm K}$ has always been a hurdle for precision measurements of curvature from late-universe probes. With the imminent commissioning of Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we demonstrate for the first time, using simulations of stage-IV surveys, the crucial role of time-delay distances from strong gravitational lenses in breaking this degeneracy. Our findings suggest that in non-flat $ow$CDM model, while strong lensing data alone only yield a $\Omega_{\rm K}$ constraint at $\sim O(10^{-1})$ level, the integration with SNe Ia and BAO data breaks the $w$-$\Omega_{\rm K}$ degeneracy and refines the $\Omega_{\rm K}$ constraint to $\sim O(10^{-2})$. This surpasses the constraints typically derived from SNe Ia Hubble diagrams and BAO data and is comparable to the constraints obtained from \textit{Planck} Primary CMB data. Additionally, we present a non-parametric approach using Gaussian Process to avoid parameter-dependency of the expansion history $H(z)$ and achieve similar $O(10^{-2})$ level constraint on $\Omega_{\rm K}$. This study demonstrates the significant potential of strong gravitational lenses and Stage-IV surveys like LSST to achieve high-fidelity, independent constraints on $\Omega_{\rm K}$, contributing to our understanding of the Universe's geometry and the dynamics of dark energy.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Constant from Blue Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a persistent $\sim 5 \sigma$ tension between the value of the Hubble constant, as derived from either the local distance ladder or the cosmic microwave background, signaling either unaccounted for systematics in the measurements or `new physics'. Determining the Hubble constant using Type Ia supernovae requires non-trivial and accurate corrections for dust extinction. To circumvent this obstacle, we here determine the Hubble constant from blue, and hence presumably unextinguished, supernovae, only. For two different compilations of Type Ia supernova data and lightcurve fitting methods we find that the derived Hubble constant is consistently lower by $\sim$ 3 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and within 1 $\sigma$ of the Cosmic Microwave Background measurement, when using only blue supernovae as opposed to using all supernovae. Although the number of blue calibrating Type Ia supernovae is small, this indicates potential systematic effects in dust corrections in standard supernova cosmology. Upcoming major transient surveys will discover numerous unextinguished SNe~Ia, and thus be able to increase precision of the Hubble constant measured from blue SNe~Ia, heralding a promising path toward resolving the Hubble constant tension.</description>

      <title>A doublet of cosmological models to challenge the H0 tension in the Pantheon Supernovae Ia catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05744v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM provides a leading framework in the interpretation of modern cosmology. Nevertheless, the scientific community still struggles with many open problems in cosmology. Among the most noticeable ones, the tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$ is particularly intriguing, prompting a wide range of possible solutions. In the present work, the flat scale-free cosmology ($S$CDM) of Maeder (2017) is tested for $H_0$ tension in fits to the Pantheon sample of Supernovae Ia. The Pantheon sample is a collection of 1048 SNe Ia, which formally defines $H_0=H(0)$ by extrapolation to redshift zero of data over positive redshifts $z&gt;0$. Here, we consider $H_{0,k}$ in fits of $S$CDM over $k$ equally sized bins of sub-samples of mean redshift $z_k$. To quantify a trend in $H_{0,k}$ with $z_k$, the results are fit by $f(z)=H'_0/(1+z)^\alpha$ in the two parameters $H'_0$ and $\alpha$. This approach tests for model imperfections or data biases by trends that are inconsistent with zero. Our findings show a decreasing trend inconsistent with zero at $5.3 \sigma$ significance, significantly more so than in $\Lambda$CDM. These results are further confirmed in Pantheon+. It appears that a solution to $H_0$ tension is to be found in models with a deceleration parameter $q_0&lt;q_{0,\Lambda}$ below that of $\Lambda$CDM, rather than $q_{0,\Lambda} &lt; q_{0,S}&lt;0$ satisfied by $S$CDM.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Self-interaction and Weak Mixing Angle Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interaction with a larger ``Fermi constant'' is often resorted to for understanding various puzzles of our universe. We point out that a light, neutrinophilic scalar particle $\phi$ through radiative correction leads to an energy-scale dependence in the neutrino-$Z$-boson gauge coupling. The driver behind this phenomenon is a large separation between the mass scales of $\phi$ and additional heavy particles needed for gauge invariance. This is a generic effect insensitive to details of the UV completion. We show that the running can change the $Z\nu\bar\nu$ coupling by several percent and affect the measurement of weak mixing angle through neutrino neutral-current processes. We discuss the interplay between the running of the $Z\nu\bar\nu$ coupling and $\sin^2\theta_W$ in various experimental observables. It is possible to disentangle the two effects with more than one precise measurement.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating isothermal sphere in an expanding background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05393v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical walls. These facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z &gt; 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the He II re-Ionization ERa via Absorbing C IV Historical Yield (HIERACHY) II: Project Design, Current Status, and Examples of Initial Data Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The He II reionization epoch is expected to take place at $z\sim3-5$. In this stage, the helium and metals in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) are further ionized with additional contributions from harder non-stellar sources, and some large-scale gravitationally bound systems approach virialization. The "Probing the He II re-Ionization ERa via Absorbing C IV Historical Yield (HIERACHY)" program utilizes high- and medium-resolution spectra of bright background quasars at $z\approx3.9-5.2$ to investigate Ly$\alpha$, C IV, and other metal absorption lines during this epoch. Additionally, we employ narrow-band imaging to search for Ly$\alpha$ emitters associated with C IV absorbers, alongside multi-wavelength observations to identify and study particularly intriguing cases. In this paper, we present the design of the HIERACHY program, its current status, major scientific goals, and examples of initial data products from completed Magellan/MIKE, MagE spectroscopy, and MDM imaging observations. We also provide a brief outlook on future multi-wavelength observations that may significantly impact the related science.</description>

      <title>FIMP Dark Matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisited the extension of the classical non-standard cosmological model in which dissipative processes are considered through a bulk viscous term in the new field $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component during the early universe. Specifically, we consider an interaction term of the form $\Gamma_{\phi} \rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ represents the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ denotes its energy density, and a bulk viscosity described by $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$, within the framework of Eckart's theory. This extended non-standard cosmology is employed to examine the parameter space for the production of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) as Dark Matter candidates. In particular, for certain combinations of the model and Dark Matter parameters, namely ($T_\text{end}$,$\kappa$) and $(m_\chi,\langle\sigma v\rangle)$, we found large new regions in which it can establish the Dark Matter and reproduce the current observable relic density as compared with the $\Lambda$CDM and the classical non-standard cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Echoes from Beyond: Detecting Gravitational Wave Quantum Imprints with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the prospects for detecting gravitational wave echoes arising due to the quantum nature of black hole horizons with LISA. In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Comparison of global networks of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performances of a world-wide network made by a European third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector, together with a 40-km Cosmic Explorer detector in the US, considering three scenarios for the European detector: (1) Einstein Telescope (ET) in its 10-km triangle configuration; (2) ET in its configuration featuring two 15-km L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics (underground, and with each detector made of a high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-frequency interferometer); (3) A single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET amplitude spectral density, either with 15~km or with 20~km arm length. Overall, we find that, if a 2L configuration should be retained for ET, the network made by a single-L European underground detector together with CE-40km could already provide a very interesting intermediate step toward the construction of a full 2L+CE network, and is in any case superior to a 10-km triangle not inserted in an international network.</description>

      <title>Constraining the average magnetic field in galaxy clusters with current and upcoming CMB surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters that host radio halos indicate the presence of population(s) of non-thermal electrons. These electrons can scatter low-energy photons of the Cosmic Microwave Background, resulting in the non-thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ntSZ) effect. We measure the average ntSZ signal from 62 radio-halo hosting clusters using the $Planck$ multi-frequency all-sky maps. We find no direct evidence of the ntSZ signal in the $Planck$ data. Combining the upper limits on the non-thermal electron density with the average measured synchrotron power collected from the literature, we place lower limits on the average magnetic field strength in our sample. The lower limit on the volume-averaged magnetic field is $0.01-0.24\,\mu$G, depending on the assumed power-law distribution of electron energies. We further explore the potential improvement of these constraints from the upcoming Simons Observatory and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) of the CCAT-prime collaboration. We find that combining these two experiments, the constraints will improve by a factor of two, which can be sufficient to rule out some power-law models.</description>

      <title>Sound Horizon Independent Constraints on Early Dark Energy: The Role of Supernova Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the consistency of cosmological models that alter the size of the sound horizon at last scattering to resolve the Hubble tension with data from ACT + Planck CMB lensing, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and supernova data from Pantheon or Pantheon+. We use early dark energy (EDE) as an example model but conclude that the results apply to other similar models. We constrain $\Lambda$CDM and EDE with these data finding that while they can constrain $\Lambda$CDM very tightly, EDE opens up the parameter space significantly and allows $H_0 &gt; 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We combine these data with measurements from ACT + Planck TT650TEEE CMB primary anisotropy and galaxy baryon acoustic oscillations, and find that overall, EDE fits these data better than $\Lambda$CDM at $\approx 2\sigma$. However, the fit to specifically the sound-horizon-independent measurements is worse for EDE than $\Lambda$CDM. We assess this increase in $\chi^2$ coming from the sound-horizon-independent measurements and find that the best-fit model is still consistent with a random statistical fluctuation even with $H_0$ values around $72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that these specific sound-horizon-independent data cannot rule out the possibility of a miscalibration of the size of the sound horizon, but leave open the possibility that other current or future sound-horizon-independent data sets could rule out such a miscalibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest results on baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument), when combined with cosmic microwave background and supernova data, show indications of a deviation from a cosmological constant in favour of evolving dark energy. Use of a pivot scale for the equation of state $w$ shows that this evidence is concentrated in the derivative of $w$ rather than its mean offset from $-1$, indicating a new cosmic coincidence where the mean equation of state matches that of the $\Lambda$CDM model precisely in the region probed by the observations. An equivalent way to express this is to say that the dark energy hits the maximum value that it will ever achieve within the observed window. We argue that conclusions on dark energy evolution are strongly driven by the assumed parameter priors and that this coincidence, which we are naming the PhantomX coincidence (where X stands for crossing), may be a signature of this.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

      <title>On the spatial distribution of the Large-Scale structure: An Unsupervised search for Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use machine learning methods to search for parity violations in the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, motivated by recent claims of chirality detection using the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF), which would suggest new physics during the epoch of inflation. This work seeks to reproduce these claims using methods originating from high energy collider analyses. Our machine learning methods optimise some underlying parity odd function of the data, and use it to evaluate the parity odd fraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of these methods and then apply them to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogue. No parity violation is detected at any significance.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the single-component thermal dust emission model in CMB experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that multiple Galactic thermal dust emission components may exist along the line of sight, but a single-component approximation is still widely used, since a full multi-component estimation requires a large number of frequency bands that are only available with future experiments. In light of this, we present a reliable, quantitative, and sensitive criterion to test the goodness of all kinds of dust emission estimations. This can not only give a definite answer to the quality of current single-component approximations; but also help determine preconditions of future multi-component estimations. Upon the former, previous works usually depend on a more complicated model to improve the single-component dust emission; however, our method is free from any additional model, and is sensitive enough to directly discover a substantial discrepancy between the Planck HFI data (100-857 GHz) and associated single-component dust emission estimations. This is the first time that the single-component estimation is ruled out by the data itself. For the latter, a similar procedure will be able to answer two important questions for estimating the complicated Galactic emissions: the number of necessary foreground components and their types.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of adding an interaction in the $G_3$ term of Horndeski theory, where the propagation of gravitational waves are not modified. We derive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We also derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes and scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter perturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational couplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in this theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory and study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the genetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the model and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$ data. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable for the model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm from the $f\sigma_{8}$ data.</description>

      <title>Flea on the elephant: Tidal Love numbers in subsolar primordial black hole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting subsolar objects in black hole binary mergers is considered a smoking gun signature of primordial black holes. Their supposedly vanishing tidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other subsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show that a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be generated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are not tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that they leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could be observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they may still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger. Finally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the matched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a decreased sensitivity in the detectors.</description>

      <title>A-SLOTH reveals the nature of the first stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first generation of stars (PopIII) are too dim to be observed directly and probably too short-lived to have survived for local observations. Hence, we rely on simulations and indirect observations to constrain the nature of the first stars. In this study, we calibrate the semi-analytical model A-SLOTH (Ancient Stars and Local Observables by Tracing Halos), designed for simulating star formation in the early Universe, using a likelihood function based on nine independent observables. These observables span Milky Way-specific and cosmologically representative variables, ensuring a comprehensive calibration process. This calibration methodology ensures that A-SLOTH provides a robust representation of the early Universe's star formation processes, aligning simulated values with observed benchmarks across a diverse set of parameters. The outcome of this calibration process is best-fit values and their uncertainties for 11 important parameters that describe star formation in the early Universe, such as the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) of PopIII stars or escape fractions of ionizing photons. Our best-fitting model has a PopIII IMF with a steeper slope, d$N$/d$M \propto M^{-1.77}$, than the log-flat models often proposed in the literature, and also relatively high minimum and maximum masses, $M_{\rm min} = 13.6$Msun and $M_{\rm max} = 197$Msun. However, we emphasize that the IMF-generating parameters are poorly constrained and, e.g., the IMF slope could vary from log-flat to Salpeter. We also provide data products, such as delay time distribution, bubble size distributions for ionizing and metal-enriched bubbles at high redshift, and correlation plots between all 11 input parameters. Our study contributes to understanding the formation of early stars through A-SLOTH and provides valuable insights into the intricate processes involved in the early Universe's star formation.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxy spin directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian analysis of anisotropy in binary galaxy spin directions in the Hyper-Suprime Cam Data Release 3 catalogue, in response to a recent claim that it exhibits a dipole (Shamir 2024). We find no significant evidence for anisotropy, or for a direction-independent spin probability that differs from 0.5. These results are unchanged allowing for a quadrupole or simply searching for a fixed anisotropy between any two hemispheres, and the Bayes factor indicates decisive evidence for the isotropic model. Our principled method contrasts with the statistic employed by Shamir 2024, which lacks a strong theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>Detection of Thermal Emission at Millimeter Wavelengths from Low-Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>
