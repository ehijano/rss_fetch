      <title>An Empirical Study of Rational Tree Unification for miniKanren</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of unification for rational trees in the context of miniKanren. We give the definition of rational trees, specify the unification algorithm and prove some of its properties. We also introduce a number of heuristic optimizations and evaluate them for a number of relevant benchmarks. Finally we discuss the relations between rational and conventional unification algorithms and possible scenarios of their coexistence in the context of relational programming.</description>

      <title>Interpolation in First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter we give a basic overview of known results regarding Craig interpolation for first-order logic as well as for fragments of first-order logic. Our aim is to provide an entry point into the literature on interpolation theorems for first-order logic and fragments of first-order logic, and their applications. In particular, we cover a range of known refinements of the Craig interpolation theorem, we discuss several important applications of interpolation in logic and computer science, we review known results about interpolation for important syntactic fragments of first-order logic, and we discuss the problem of computing interpolants.</description>

      <title>Unreliability in Practical Subclasses of Communicating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of communicating automata are prominent models for peer-to-peer message-passing over unbounded channels, but in the general scenario, most verification properties are undecidable. To address this issue, two decidable subclasses, Realisable with Synchronous Communication (RSC) and k-Multiparty Compatibility} (k-MC), were proposed in the literature, with corresponding verification tools developed and applied in practice. Unfortunately, both RSC and k-MC are not resilient under failures: (1) their decidability relies on the assumption of perfect channels and (2) most standard protocols do not satisfy RSC or k-MC under failures. To address these limitations, this paper studies the resilience of RSC and k-MC under two distinct failure models: interference and crash-stop failures. For interference, we relax the conditions of RSC and k-MC and prove that the inclusions of these relaxed properties remain decidable under interference, preserving their known complexity bounds. We then propose a novel crash-handling communicating system that captures wider behaviours than existing multiparty session types (MPST) with crash-stop failures. We study a translation of MPST with crash-stop failures into this system integrating RSC and k-MC properties, and establish their decidability results. Finally, by verifying representative protocols from the literature using RSC and k-MC tools extended to interferences, we evaluate the relaxed systems and demonstrate their resilience.</description>

      <title>On Hyperproperty Verification, Quantifier Alternations, and Games under Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperproperties generalize traditional trace properties by relating multiple execution traces rather than reasoning about individual runs in isolation. They provide a unified way to express important requirements such as information flow and robustness properties. Temporal logics like HyperLTL capture these properties by explicitly quantifying over executions of a system. However, many practically relevant hyperproperties involve quantifier alternations, a feature that poses substantial challenges for automated verification. Complete verification methods require a system complementation for each quantifier alternation, making it infeasible in practice. A cheaper (but incomplete) method interprets the verification of a HyperLTL formula as a two-player game between universal and existential quantifiers. The game-based approach is significantly cheaper, facilitates interactive proofs, and allows for easy-to-check certificates of satisfaction. It is, however, limited to $\forall^*\exists^*$ properties, leaving important properties out of reach. In this paper, we show that we can use games to verify hyperproperties with arbitrary quantifier alternations by utilizing multiplayer games under partial information. While games under partial information are, in general, undecidable, we show that our game is played under hierarchical information and thus falls in a decidable class of games. We discuss the completeness of the game and study prophecy variables in the setting of partial information.</description>

      <title>Strategy Logic, Imperfect Information, and Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategy logic (SL) is a powerful temporal logic that enables first-class reasoning over strategic behavior in multi-agent systems (MAS). In many MASs, the agents (and their strategies) cannot observe the global state of the system, leading to many extensions of SL centered around imperfect information, such as strategy logic with imperfect information (SL$_\mathit{ii}$). Along orthogonal lines, researchers have studied the combination of strategic behavior and hyperproperties. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple executions in a system and commonly arise when specifying security policies. Hyper Strategy Logic (HyperSL) is a temporal logic that combines quantification over strategies with the ability to express hyperproperties on the executions of different strategy profiles. In this paper, we study the relation between SL$_\mathit{ii}$ and HyperSL. Our main result is that both logics (restricted to formulas where no state formulas are nested within path formulas) are equivalent in the sense that we can encode SL$_\mathit{ii}$ instances into HyperSL instances and vice versa. For the former direction, we build on the well-known observation that imperfect information is a hyperproperty. For the latter direction, we construct a self-composition of MASs and show how we can simulate hyperproperties using imperfect information.</description>

      <title>A Complete Diagrammatic Calculus for Conditional Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the synthetic theories of discrete and Gaussian categorical probability by introducing a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about hybrid probabilistic models in which continuous random variables, conditioned on discrete ones, follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This setting includes important classes of models such as Gaussian mixture models, where each Gaussian component is selected according to a discrete variable. We develop a string diagrammatic syntax for expressing and combining these models, give it a compositional semantics, and equip it with a sound and complete equational theory that characterises when two models represent the same distribution.</description>

      <title>Continuation Semantics for Fixpoint Modal Logic and Computation Tree Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce continuation semantics for both fixpoint modal logic (FML) and Computation Tree Logic* (CTL*), parameterised by a choice of branching type and quantitative predicate lifting. Our main contribution is proving that they are equivalent to coalgebraic semantics, for all branching types. Our continuation semantics is defined over coalgebras of the continuation monad whose answer type coincides with the domain of truth values of the formulas. By identifying predicates and continuations, such a coalgebra has a canonical interpretation of the modality by evaluation of continuations. We show that this continuation semantics is equivalent to the coalgebraic semantics for fixpoint modal logic. We then reformulate the current construction for coalgebraic models of CTL*. These models are usually required to have an infinitary trace/maximal execution map, characterized as the greatest fixpoint of a special operator. Instead, we allow coalgebraic models of CTL* to employ non-maximal fixpoints, which we call execution maps. Under this reformulation, we establish a general result on transferring execution maps via monad morphisms. From this result, we obtain that continuation semantics is equivalent to the coalgebraic semantics for CTL*. We also identify a sufficient condition under which CTL can be encoded into fixpoint modal logic under continuation semantics.</description>

      <title>Curved Boolean Logic: A Contextual Generalization of Propositional Logic with Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a theory for computational control, consisting of seven naturally interpretable equations. Adding these to a prop of base circuits constructs controlled circuits, borne out in examples of reversible Boolean circuits and quantum circuits. We prove that this syntactic construction semantically corresponds to taking the free rig category on the base prop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for evaluating the alignment between natural language plans and their expected behavior by converting them into Kripke structures and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and performing model checking. We systematically evaluate this framework on a simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.</description>

      <title>An algebra modality admitting countably many deriving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03953v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category, that is, a symmetric monoidal category enriched over commutative monoids, with an algebra modality, axiomatizing smooth functions, and a deriving transformation on this algebra modality, axiomatizing differentiation. Lemay proved that a comonoidal algebra modality has at most one deriving transformation, thus differentiation is unique in models of differential linear logic. It was then an open problem whether this result extends to arbitrary algebra modalities. We answer this question in the negative. We build a free "commutative rig with a self-map" algebra modality on the category of commutative monoids, where the self-map can be seen as an arbitrary smooth function. We then define a countable family of distinct deriving transformations $({}_{n}\mathsf{d})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this algebra modality where the parameter $n$ controls the derivative of the self-map. It shows that in a differential category, a single algebra modality may admit multiple, inequivalent notions of differentiation.</description>

      <title>Extensional Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08489v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a calculus of extensional resource terms. These are resource terms \`a la Ehrhard-Regnier, but in infinitely eta-long form. The calculus still retains a finite syntax and dynamics: in particular, we prove strong confluence and normalization.
  Then we define an extensional version of Taylor expansion, mapping ordinary lambda-terms to (possibly infinite) linear combinations of extensional resource terms: like in the ordinary case, the dynamics of our resource calculus allows us to simulate the beta-reduction of lambda-terms; the extensional nature of this expansion shows in the fact that we are also able to simulate eta-reduction.
  In a sense, extensional resource terms contain a language of finite approximants of Nakajima trees, much like ordinary resource terms can be seen as a richer version of finite B\"ohm trees. We show that the equivalence induced on lambda-terms by the normalization of extensional Taylor-expansion is nothing but H*, the greatest consistent sensible lambda-theory -- which is also the theory induced by Nakajima trees. This characterization provides a new, simple way to exhibit models of H*: it becomes sufficient to model the extensional resource calculus and its dynamics.
  The extensional resource calculus moreover allows us to recover, in an untyped setting, a connection between Taylor expansion and game semantics that was previously limited to the typed setting. Indeed, simply typed, eta-long, beta-normal resource terms are known to be in bijective correspondence with plays in the sense of Hyland-Ong game semantics, up to Melli\`es' homotopy equivalence. Extensional resource terms are the appropriate counterpart of eta-long resource terms in an untyped setting: we spell out the bijection between normal extensional resource terms and isomorphism classes of augmentations (a canonical presentation of plays up to homotopy) in the universal arena.</description>

      <title>Derivatives on Graphs for the Positive Calculus of Relations with Transitive Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the equational theory of the positive calculus of relations with transitive closure (PCoR*) is EXPSPACE-complete. Here, PCoR* terms consist of the following standard operators on binary relations: identity, empty, universality, union, intersection, composition, converse, and reflexive transitive closure (so, PCoR* terms subsume Kleene algebra and allegory terms as fragments). Additionally, we show that the equational theory of PCoR* extended with tests and nominals (in hybrid logic) is still EXPSPACE-complete; moreover, it is PSPACE-complete for its intersection-free fragment.
  To this end, we design derivatives on graphs by extending derivatives on words for regular expressions. The derivatives give a finite automata construction on path decompositions, like those on words. Because the equational theory has a linearly bounded pathwidth model property, we can decide the equational theory of PCoR* using these automata.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficiently executable, formally verified implementation of interval iteration for MDPs. Our correctness proofs span the entire development from the high-level abstract semantics of MDPs to a low-level implementation in LLVM that is based on floating-point arithmetic. We use the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant to verify convergence of our abstract definition of interval iteration and employ step-wise refinement to derive an efficient implementation in LLVM code. To that end, we extend the Isabelle Refinement Framework with support for reasoning about floating-point arithmetic and directed rounding modes. We experimentally demonstrate that the verified implementation is competitive with state-of-the-art tools for MDPs, while providing formal guarantees on the correctness of the results.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Implicative Rules: A Unified Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rule mining algorithms are one of the fundamental techniques in data mining for disclosing significant patterns in terms of linguistic rules expressed in natural language. In this paper, we revisit the concept of fuzzy implicative rule to provide a solid theoretical framework for any fuzzy rule mining algorithm interested in capturing patterns in terms of logical conditionals rather than the co-occurrence of antecedent and consequent. In particular, we study which properties should satisfy the fuzzy operators to ensure a coherent behavior of different quality measures. As a consequence of this study, we introduce a new property of fuzzy implication functions related to a monotone behavior of the generalized modus ponens for which we provide different valid solutions. Also, we prove that our modeling generalizes others if an adequate choice of the fuzzy implication function is made, so it can be seen as an unifying framework. Further, we provide an open-source implementation in Python for mining fuzzy implicative associative rules. We test the applicability and relevance of our framework for different real datasets and fuzzy operators.</description>

      <title>Compositional Verification in Concurrent Separation Logic with Permissions Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concurrent separation logic with fractional permissions (CSLPerm) provides a promising reasoning system to verify most complex sequential and concurrent fine-grained programs. The logic with strong and weak separating conjunctions offers a solid foundation for producing concise and precise proofs. However, it lacks automation and compositionality support. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a compositional verification system for concurrent programs that manipulate regions of shared memory. The centre of our system is novel logical principles and an entailment procedure that can infer the residual heaps in the frame rule for a fragment of CSL-Perm with explicit arithmetical constraints for memory heaps' disjointness. This procedure enables the compositional reasoning for concurrent threads and function calls. We have implemented the proposal in a prototype tool called CoSl, tested it with 10 challenging concurrent programs, including those beyond the state-of-the-art, and confirmed the advantage of our approach.</description>

      <title>Network Satisfaction Problems Solved by k-Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the problem of deciding for a given finite relation algebra A whether the network satisfaction problem for A can be solved by the k-consistency procedure, for some natural number k, is undecidable. For the important class of finite relation algebras A with a normal representation, however, the decidability of this problem remains open. We show that if A is symmetric and has a flexible atom, then the question whether NSP(A) can be solved by k-consistency, for some natural number k, is decidable (even in polynomial time in the number of atoms of A). This result follows from a more general sufficient condition for the correctness of the k-consistency procedure for finite symmetric relation algebras. In our proof we make use of a result of Alexandr Kazda about finite binary conservative structures.</description>

      <title>On the theory of exponential integer parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We axiomatize the first-order theories of exponential integer parts of real-closed exponential fields in a language with $2^x$, in a language with a predicate for powers of 2, and in the basic language of ordered rings. In particular, the last theory extends IOpen by sentences expressing the existence of winning strategies in a certain game on integers; we show that it is a proper extension of IOpen, and give upper and lower bounds on the required number of rounds needed to win the game.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Semantics for Jumping Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11849v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jumping automata are finite automata that read their input in a non-sequential manner, by allowing a reading head to ``jump'' between positions on the input, consuming a permutation of the input word. We argue that allowing the head to jump should incur some cost. To this end, we propose four quantitative semantics for jumping automata, whereby the jumps of the head in an accepting run define the cost of the run. The four semantics correspond to different interpretations of jumps: the \emph{absolute distance} semantics counts the distance the head jumps, the \emph{reversal} semantics counts the number of times the head changes direction, the \emph{Hamming distance} measures the number of letter-swaps the run makes, and the \emph{maximum jump} semantics counts the maximal distance the head jumps in a single step,
  We study these measures, with the main focus being the \emph{boundedness problem}: given a jumping automaton, decide whether its (quantitative) language is bounded by some given number $k$. We establish the decidability and complexity for this problem under several variants.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning as Iterated Belief Change a la Darwiche and Pearl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.</description>

      <title>Cubic incompleteness: Hilbert's tenth problem begins at degree three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary result addressing a long-standing open question: Are cubic Diophantine equations undecidable?} We answer in the affirmative. By encoding G\"odel's first incompleteness theorem via a Fibonacc-based G\"oodel numbering and the Zeckendorf representation, we reduce the arithmetic complexity sufficiently to construct an explicit \emph{cubic Diophantine equation} whose solvability is independent of a model provided by \emph{Peano axioms}. We present three results. First, a commonsense argument that relies on an unjustified generalization by necessity. Second, a constructive procedure that, given any Turing machine $M$, produces a cubic polynomial $Q_M(\vec{u}) \in \mathbb{Z}[\vec{u}]$ of total degree at most $3$, such that the equation $Q_M(\vec{u}) = 0$ has a solution in $\mathbb{N}^k$ if and only if $M$ halts on empty input. Third, we formalize a thesis concerning bounds.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations Through Contrastive Neural Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings. We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.</description>
