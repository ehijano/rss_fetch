      <title>Permutation closure for multiple context-free languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the \emph{permutation closure} of a multiple context-free language is multiple context-free, which extends work of Okhotin and Sorokin [LATA 2020] who showed closure under \emph{cyclic shift}, and complements work of Brandst\"adt [1981, RAIRO Inform. Th\'{e}or.] (resp. Brough \emph{et al.} [2016, Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci.]) who showed the same result for regular, context-sensitive, recursively enumerable (resp. EDT0L and ET0L) languages. In contrast to Okhotin and Sorokin who work with grammars, our proof uses restricted tree stack automata due to Denkinger [DLT 2016].</description>

      <title>Passive Learning of Lattice Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a passive automata learning algorithm that can extract automata from recurrent networks with very large or even infinite alphabets. Our method combines overapproximations from the field of Abstract Interpretation and passive automata learning from the field of Grammatical Inference. We evaluate our algorithm by first comparing it with the state-of-the-art automata extraction algorithm from Recurrent Neural Networks trained on Tomita grammars. Then, we extend these experiments to regular languages with infinite alphabets, which we propose as a novel benchmark.</description>

      <title>Learn, Check, Test -- Security Testing Using Automata Learning and Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems are part of industrial systems and critical infrastructure. Therefore, they should be examined in a comprehensive manner to verify their correctness and security. At the same time, the complexity of such systems demands such examinations to be systematic and, if possible, automated for efficiency and accuracy. A method that can be useful in this context is model checking. However, this requires a model that faithfully represents the behavior of the examined system. Obtaining such a model is not trivial, as many of these systems can be examined only in black box settings due to, e.g., long supply chains or secrecy. We therefore utilize active black box learning techniques to infer behavioral models in the form of Mealy machines of such systems and translate them into a form that can be evaluated using a model checker. To this end, we will investigate a cyber-physical systems as a black box using its external communication interface. We first annotate the model with propositions by mapping context information from the respective protocol to the model using Context-based Proposition Maps (CPMs). We gain annotated Mealy machines that resemble Kripke structures. We then formally define a template, to transfer the structures model checker-compatible format. We further define generic security properties based on basic security requirements. Due to the used CPMs, we can instantiate these properties with a meaningful context to check a specific protocol, which makes the approach flexible and scalable. The gained model can be easily altered to introduce non-deterministic behavior (like timeouts) or faults and examined if the properties still. Lastly, we demonstrate the versatility of the approach by providing case studies of different communication protocols (NFC and UDS), checked with the same tool chain and the same security properties.</description>

      <title>From Formal Language Theory to Statistical Learning: Finite Observability of Subregular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is available at https://github.com/UTokyo-HayashiLab/subregular.</description>

      <title>A substitution lemma for multiple context-free languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new criterion for proving that a language is not multiple context-free, which we call a Substitution Lemma. We apply it to show a sample selection of languages are not multiple context-free, including the word problem of $F_2\times F_2$. Our result is in contrast to Kanazawa et al. [2014, Theory Comput. Syst.] who proved that it was not possible to generalise the standard pumping lemma for context-free languages to multiple context-free languages, and Kanazawa [2019, Inform. and Comput.] who showed a weak variant of generalised Ogden's lemma does not apply to multiple context-free languages. We also record that groups with multiple context-free word problem have decidable rational subset membership problem.</description>
