      <title>Autonomic Arousal in Social Anxiety: An Electrodermal Activity Study During an Emotionally Salient Cognitive Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with heightened physiological arousal in social-evaluative contexts, but it remains unclear whether such autonomic reactivity extends to non-evaluative cognitive stressors. This study investigated electrodermal activity (EDA) patterns in socially anxious (SA) and non-socially anxious (NSA) individuals during an emotionally salient 2-back working memory task using facial expressions. 50 participants (25 SA, 25 NSA) completed both a baseline rest period and the task while EDA data were collected via the Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor. A range of EDA features, such as tonic and phasic components, number and amplitude of skin conductance responses, and sympathetic activation estimates, were analyzed using a standardized, interval-based approach. Results revealed significant increases in EDA across all participants from baseline to task, indicating elevated autonomic arousal during cognitive load. However, no significant group differences were found between SA and NSA individuals. These findings suggest that cognitive-emotional stress, in the absence of social-evaluative threat, elicits comparable physiological responses regardless of social anxiety status. The results underscore the context-dependent nature of anxiety-related autonomic reactivity and advocate for the inclusion of social-evaluative or recovery phases in future research to detect more nuanced group effects.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Embeddings of Speech Enhance and Explain Brain Encoding Performance of Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models (SSMs) are increasingly hailed as more powerful computational models of human speech perception than models based on traditional hand-crafted features. However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic Question-Answering features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SSMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying the shared and unique neural variance captured by each feature class. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, our interpretable model predicted electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to speech more accurately than any SSM. Moreover, augmenting SSM representations with interpretable features yielded the best overall neural predictions, significantly outperforming either class alone. Further variance-partitioning analyses revealed previously unresolved components of SSM representations that contribute to their neural alignment: 1. Despite the common assumption that later layers of SSMs discard low-level acoustic information, these models compress and preferentially retain frequency bands critical for neural encoding of speech (100-1000 Hz). 2. Contrary to previous claims, SSMs encode brain-relevant semantic information that cannot be reduced to lower-level features, improving with context length and model size. These results highlight the importance of using refined, interpretable features in understanding speech perception.</description>

      <title>A statistical complexity measure can differentiate Go/NoGo trials during a visual-motor task using human electroencephalogram data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity is a ubiquitous concept in contemporary science and everyday life. A complex dynamical system is usually characterized by a blend of order and disorder, as well as emergent phenomena that often span multiple temporal and spatial scales. The information processes related to different cognitive processes in the brain can be studied in light of statistical differences based on complexity measures of the electrophysiological time series from different trial types. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a symbolic information approach can be a valuable tool for discriminating response-related differences between Go and NoGo trials using the local field potential of brain regions in monkeys. The method shows significant differences between trial types earlier than the simple average of the electrical signals. Here, we analyze human electroencephalogram data during a Go/NoGo task using information-theoretical quantifiers, including entropy and complexity. We employ the Bandt-Pompe symbolization methodology to determine a probability distribution function for each time series and then to calculate information theory indices. We show that a few channels, especially a central and an occipital electrode, consistently differentiate Go/NoGo trials at the individual level. We also show that different trial types occupy separate regions in the complexity-entropy plane. Our method also captures specific time windows to better differentiate the trial type. Moreover, we show that our results are robust at the group level, considering the average activity of all subjects.</description>

      <title>Spiking neurons as predictive controllers of linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.</description>

      <title>Depression as a disorder of distributional coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major depressive disorder persistently stands as a major public health problem. While some progress has been made toward effective treatments, the neural mechanisms that give rise to the disorder remain poorly understood. In this Perspective, we put forward a new theory of the pathophysiology of depression. More precisely, we spotlight three previously separate bodies of research, showing how they can be fit together into a previously overlooked larger picture. The first piece of the puzzle is provided by pathophysiology research implicating dopamine in depression. The second piece, coming from computational psychiatry, links depression with a special form of reinforcement learning. The third and final piece involves recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and basic neuroscience research, indicating that the brain may represent value using a distributional code. Fitting these three pieces together yields a new model of depression's pathophysiology, which spans circuit, systems, computational and behavioral levels, opening up new directions for research.</description>

      <title>GASPnet: Global Agreement to Synchronize Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image. Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Decomposition of Functional Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to analyze dynamically changing brain networks by decomposing them into three orthogonal components through the Hodge decomposition. We propose to quantify the magnitude and relative strength of each component. We performed extensive simulation studies with known ground truth. The Hodge decomposition is then applied to the dynamically changing human brain networks obtained from a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Our results indicate that the components of the Hodge decomposition contain biologically interpretable topological features that provide statistically significant findings not easily captured by traditional methods.</description>
