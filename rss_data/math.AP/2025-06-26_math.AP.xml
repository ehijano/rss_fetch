      <title>The $\mathcal{M}$-Operator and Uniqueness of Nonlinear Kinetic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an $\mathcal{M}$-operator approach to establish the uniqueness of continuous or bounded solutions for a broad class of Landau-type nonlinear kinetic equations. The specific $\mathcal{M}$-operator, originally developed in [3], acts as a negative fractional derivative in both spatial and velocity variables and interacts in a controllable manner with the kinetic transport operator. The novelty of this method is that it bypasses the need for bounds on the derivatives of the solution - an assumption typically required in uniqueness arguments for non-cutoff equations. As a result, the method enables working with solutions with low regularity.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for the NLS equation with mixed fractional Laplacians and combined nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look for normalized solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with mixed fractional Laplacians and combined nonlinearities $$ \left\{\begin{array}{ll} (-\Delta)^{s_{1}} u+(-\Delta)^{s_{2}} u=\lambda u+\mu |u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{p-2}u \ \text{in}\;{\mathbb{R}^{N}}, \\[0.1cm] \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|u|^2\mathrm dx=a^2, \end{array} \right. $$ where $N\geq 2,\;0&lt;s_2&lt;s_1&lt;1, \mu&gt;0$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ appears as an unknown Lagrange multiplier. We mainly focus on some special cases, including fractional Sobolev subcritical or critical exponent. More precisely, for $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4s_2}{N}&lt;2+\frac{4s_1}{N}&lt;p&lt;2_{s_1}^{\ast}:=\frac{2N}{N-2s_1}$, we prove that the above problem has at least two solutions: a ground state with negative energy and a solution of mountain pass type with positive energy. For $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4s_2}{N}$ and $p=2_{s_1}^{\ast}$, we also obtain the existence of ground states. Our results extend some previous ones of Chergui et al. (Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ., 2023) and Luo et al. (Adv. Nonlinear Stud., 2022).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Boundary Layer Solutions to Poisson-Boltzmann Type Equations in General Bounded Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary layer solution to singular perturbation problems involving Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) type equations with a small parameter $\epsilon$ in general bounded smooth domains (including multiply connected domains) under the Robin boundary condition. The PB type equations include the classical PB, modified PB and charge-conserving PB (CCPB) equations, which are mathematical models for the electric potential and ion distributions. The CCPB equations present particular analytical challenges due to their nonlocal nonlinearity introduced through integral terms enforcing charge conservation. Using the principal coordinate system, exponential-type estimates and the moving plane agruments, we rigorously prove asymptotic expansions of boundary layer solutions throughout the whole domain. The solution domain is partitioned into three characteristic regions based on the distance from the boundary: Region I, where the distance from the boundary is at most $T\sqrt\epsilon$, Region II, where the distance ranges between $T\sqrt\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^\beta$, and Region III, where the distance is at least $\epsilon^\beta$, for given parameters $T&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/2$. In Region I, we derive second-order asymptotic formulas explicitly incorporating the effects of boundary mean curvature, while exponential decay estimates are established for Regions II and III. Furthermore, we obtain asymptotic expansions for key physical quantities, including the electric potential, electric field, total ionic charge density and total ionic charge, revealing how domain geometry regulates electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in Non-isentropic Compressible Immiscible Two-Phase Flow with van der Waals Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes the global well-posedness of the compressible non-isentropic Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system governed by the van der Waals equation of state $p(\rho,\theta)=- a\rho^2+\frac{R\theta\rho}{1-b\rho}$ and degenerate thermal conductivity $\kappa(\theta)=\tilde{\kappa}\theta^\beta$, where $p$, $\rho$ and $\theta$ are the pressure, the density and the temperature of the flow respectively, and $a,b,R,\tilde\kappa$ are positive constants related to the physical properties of the flow. Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system models immiscible two-phase flow with diffusive interfaces, where the non-monotonic pressure-density relationship in the van der Waals equation drives gas-liquid phase transitions. By developing a refined $L^2$-energy framework, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions to the one-dimensional Cauchy problem for non-vacuum and finite-temperature initial data, without imposing smallness restrictions on the initial conditions. The findings demonstrate that despite non-monotonic pressure inducing substantial density fluctuations and triggering phase transitions, all physical quantities remain bounded over finite time intervals.</description>

      <title>Shape sensitivity analysis of the heat equation and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Dirichlet problem for the heat equation in a domain containing an interior hole. The domain has a fixed outer boundary and a variable inner boundary determined by a diffeomorphism $\phi$. We analyze the maps that assign to the infinite-dimensional shape parameter $\phi$ the corresponding solution and its normal derivative, and we prove that both are smooth. Motivated by an application to an inverse problem, we then compute the differential with respect to $\phi$ of the normal derivative of the solution on the exterior boundary.</description>

      <title>Solving Mean-Field Games with Monotonicity Methods in Banach Spaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for proving the existence of solutions to stationary first-order mean-field games (MFGs) based on the theory of monotone operators in Banach spaces. We cast the coupled MFG system as a variational inequality, overcoming the limitations of prior Hilbert-space approaches that relied on high-order regularization and typically yielded only weak solutions in the monotone operator sense. In contrast, with our low-order regularization, we obtain strong solutions.
  Our approach addresses the non-coercivity of the underlying MFG operator through two key regularization strategies. First, by adding a low-order $p$-Laplacian term, we restore coercivity, derive uniform a priori estimates, and pass to the limit via Minty's method. This establishes, for the first time via monotonicity methods, the existence of strong solutions for models with both standard power-growth and singular congestion, with the latter requiring a careful restriction of the operator's domain. Second, for Hamiltonians with only minimal growth hypotheses, we regularize the Hamiltonian itself via infimal convolution to prove the existence of weak solutions.
  Our Banach-space framework unifies and extends earlier existence results. By avoiding high-order smoothing, it not only provides a more direct theoretical path but is also ideally suited for modern numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of solutions to semilinear evolution equations in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new linearization principle for the nonlinear stability of solutions to semilinear evolution equations of parabolic type. We assume that the set of equilibria forms a finite dimensional manifold of normally stable and normally hyperbolic equilibria. In addition, we assume that the linearized operator is the generator of an analytic semigroup (not necessarily stable). We show that if a mild solution to our evolution equation exists globally in time and remains ``close'' to the manifold of equilibria at all times, then the solution must eventually converge to an equilibrium point at an exponential rate.
  We apply our abstract results to the equations governing the motion of a fluid-filled heavy solid. Under general assumptions on the physical configuration and initial conditions, we show that weak solutions to the governing equations eventually converge to a steady state with an exponential rate. In particular, the fluid velocity relative to the solid converges to zero as $t\to\infty$ in $H^{2\alpha}_p(\Omega)$ for each $p\in [1,\infty)$ and $\alpha\in [0,1)$ as well as in $H^{2}_2(\Omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of semi-stable radial solutions $u\in H^1(B_1)$ of $-\Delta u=\vert x\vert^\alpha f(u) \mbox{ in } B_1\setminus\lbrace0\rbrace$, where $f\in C^1(\mathbb{R})$ is a general nonlinearity, $\alpha&gt;-2$ and $B_1$ is the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N&gt;1$. We establish the boudness of such solutions for dimensions $2\leq N&lt;10+4\alpha$ and sharp pointwise estimates in the case $N\geq10+4\alpha$. In addition, we provide, for this range of dimensions, a large family of semi-stable radially decreasing unbounded $H^1(B_1)$ solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove, unconditionally, the linear stability of the Kerr family in the full subextremal range. On an analytic level, our proof is the same as that of our earlier paper in the slowly rotating case. The additional ingredients we use are, firstly, the mode stability result proved by Andersson, Whiting, and the first author and, secondly, computations related to the zero energy behavior of the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein equation in work by the second author.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct families of rotationally symmetric toroidal domains in $\mathbb R^3$ for which the eigenfields associated to the first (positive) Amp\`erian curl eigenvalue are symmetric, and others for which no first eigenfield is symmetric. This implies, in particular, that minimizers of the celebrated Woltjer's variational principle do not need to inherit the rotational symmetry of the domain. This disproves the folk wisdom that the eigenfields corresponding to the lowest curl eigenvalue must be symmetric if the domain is.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic solutions of the generalized SQG equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This monograph addresses an important problem in mathematical fluid dynamics: constructing stable, long-term solutions to certain quasilinear evolution equations. We implement an elaborate scheme for building global quasiperiodic solutions without relying on external parameters. Instead of relying on artificial external parameters, we exploit the natural structure of initial data to generate families of stable solutions. This approach offers a more robust framework for studying global solutions of quasilinear PDEs.
  The book combines techniques from KAM theory, a Nash-Moser iteration scheme, and pseudo-differential calculus, and provides tools that extend beyond the specific SQG context and may prove useful for other evolution equations.
  Specifically, we establish the existence of quasiperiodic patch solutions for the generalized Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation (SQG) across the parameter range $\alpha \in (1,2)$, in a neighborhood of the disk solution. These solutions exist globally in time without developing singularities, addressing an important question about the behavior of geophysical fluid models. This work provides new insights into global dynamics in a mathematically challenging regime where standard perturbative methods are insufficient. The techniques developed here offer potential applications to other evolution equations in mathematical physics, making this a valuable resource for researchers in partial differential equations, fluid dynamics, and related fields.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many isolas of modulational instability for Stokes waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the long-standing conjecture regarding the existence of infinitely many high-frequency modulational instability ``isolas" for a Stokes wave in arbitrary depth $ \mathtt{h} &gt; 0 $, subject to longitudinal perturbations. We completely describe the spectral bands with non-zero real part away from the origin of the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the water waves system linearized at a Stokes waves of small amplitude $ \epsilon &gt; 0 $. The unstable spectrum is the union of isolas of elliptical shape, parameterized by integers $ \mathtt{p}\geq 2 $, with semiaxis of size $ |\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})} (\mathtt{h})| \epsilon^\mathtt{p}+ O(\epsilon^{\mathtt{p}+1} )$ where $\beta_1^{( \mathtt{p})} (\mathtt{h})$ is a nonzero analytic function of the depth $ \mathtt{h} $ that depends on the Taylor coefficients of the Stokes waves up to order $\mathtt{p}$.</description>

      <title>On the stationary solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation on a nanowire with constant external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinite ferromagnetic nanowire, with an energy functional $E$ with easy-axis in the direction $e_1$ and a constant external magnetic field $H_{ext} = h_0 e_1$ along the same direction. The evolution of its magnetization is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG) associated to $E$. Under some assumptions on $h_0$, we prove the existence of stationary solutions with the same limits at infinity, their uniqueness up to the invariances of the equation and the instability of their orbits with respect to the flow. This property gives interesting new insights of the behavior of the solutions of (LLG), which are completed by some numerical simulations and discussed afterwards, in particular regarding the stability of 2-domain wall structures proven in \cite{Cote_Ferriere__2DW} and more generally the interactions between domain walls.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of a Hele-Shaw-like system resulting from an inverse geometry problem formulated through a shape optimization setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we revisit a shape optimization reformulation of a prototypical shape inverse problem and briefly propose a simple yet efficient numerical approach for solving the corresponding minimization problem. Second, we examine the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence of a classical solution to a Hele-Shaw-like system, which is derived from the continuous setting of a numerical discretization of the shape optimization reformulation for the shape inverse problem. The analysis is based on the methods developed by G. I. Bizhanova and V. A. Solonnikov in ``On Free Boundary Problems for Second Order Parabolic Equations" (Algebra Anal. 12 (6) (2000) 98-139), and by V. A. Solonnikov in ``Lectures on Evolution Free Boundary Problems: Classical Solutions" (Lect. Notes Math., Springer, 2003, pp. 123-175).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) in dimension one posed on the unbounded real line. Several previous works have considered the deep neural network approximation of NLS solutions from the numerical and theoretical point of view in the case of bounded domains. In this paper, we introduce a new PINNs method to treat the case of unbounded domains and show rigorous bounds on the associated approximation error in terms of the energy and Strichartz norms, provided a reasonable integration scheme is available. Applications to traveling waves, breathers and solitons, as well as numerical experiments confirming the validity of the approximation are also presented as well.</description>

      <title>Stochastic homogenisation of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a periodic structure.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics approximation schemes for anisotropic mean curvature flows with a forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of threshold dynamics-type approximation schemes to propagating fronts evolving according to an anisotropic mean curvature motion in the presence of a forcing term depending on both time and position, thus generalizing the consistency result obtained in [Ishii-Pires-Souganidis, 1999] by extending the results obtained in [Caffarelli-Souganidis, 2010] for $\alpha \in [1,2)$ to anisotropic kernels and in the presence of a driving force. The limit geometric evolution is of a variational type and can be approximated, at a large scale, by eikonal-type equations modeling dislocations dynamics. We prove that it preserves convexity under suitable convexity assumptions on the forcing term and that convex evolutions of compact sets are unique. If the initial set is bounded and sufficiently large, and the driving force is constant, then the corresponding generalized front propagation is asymptotically similar to the Wulff shape.</description>

      <title>A Note on Continuous dependence of Navier-Stokes equations with oscillating force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the averaging effect of a highly oscillating external force on the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that, as long as the force time-average decays over time, if the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating force grow, then the corresponding solutions to Navier-Stokes equations converge (in a suitable topology) to the solution of the homogeneous equations with same initial data. Our approach involves reformulating the system as an abstract evolution equation in a Banach space, and then proving continuous dependence of solutions on both initial conditions and the external forcing.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation linearized around a vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the linearized two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation around a vortex of degree one, with data in the same equivariance class. Various estimates are proved for the solution; in particular, conditions for optimal decay in $L^\infty$ and boundedness in $L^2$ are identified. The analysis relies on a full description of the spectral resolution of the linearized operator through the associated distorted Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotics of solution to defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a class of step initial data. A rigorous asymptotic analysis is conducted on the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem by applying Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this process, the construction of odd-symmetry g-function is generalized and the method of genus reduction on the Riemann-theta function is proposed via conformal transformation and symmetries. It is revealed that for sufficiently large time, the solution manifests a tripartite spatiotemporal structure, i.e., in the left plane-wave region, the solution decays to a modulated plane wave with oscillatory correction; in the central dispersive shock wave region, the solution is governed by a modulated elliptic periodic wave; in the right plane wave region, the solution converges exponentially to a constant. The results from the long-time asymptotic analysis have been shown to match remarkably well with that obtained by direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Tug-of-war games related to $p$-Laplace type equations with lower order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of tug-of-war games that incorporate a constant payoff discount rate at each turn. The associated model problems are $p$-Laplace type partial differential equations with zeroth-order terms. We establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for the corresponding game value functions. Furthermore, we explore properties of the solutions to the model PDEs, informed by the analysis of the underlying games.</description>

      <title>Arnold-Thom conjecture for the arrival time of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following \L ojasiewicz's uniqueness theorem and Thom's gradient conjecture, Arnold proposed a stronger version about the existence of limit tangents of gradient flow lines for analytic functions. We prove \L ojasiewicz's theorem and Arnold's conjecture in the context of arrival time functions for mean curvature flows in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with neck or non-degenerate cylindrical singularities. In particular, we prove the conjectures for all mean convex mean curvature flows of surfaces, including the cases when the arrival time functions are not $C^2.$ The results also apply to mean curvature flows starting from two-spheres or generic closed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacians on the hyperbolic space -- a compared study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main motivation behind this paper stems from a notable gap in the existing literature: the absence of a discrete counterpart to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds, which can be effectively used to solve PDEs. We consider that the natural approach to pioneer this field is first to explore one of the simplest non-trivial (i.e., non-Euclidean) scenarios, specifically focusing on the $2$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^2$. We present two variants of discrete finite-difference operator tailored to this constant negatively curved space, both serving as approximations to the (continuous) Laplace-Beltrami operator within the $\mathrm{L}^2$ framework.
  We prove that the discrete heat equation associated with both operators mentioned above exhibits stability and converges towards the continuous heat-Beltrami Cauchy problem on $\mathbb{H}^2$. Moreover, using techniques inspired from the sharp analysis of discrete functional inequalities, we prove that the solutions of the discrete heat equations corresponding to both variants of discrete Laplacian exhibit an exponential decay asymptotically equal to the one induced by the Poincar\'e inequality on $\mathbb{H}^2$.
  Eventually, we illustrate that a discrete Laplacian specifically designed for the geometry of the hyperbolic space yields a more precise approximation and offers advantages from both theoretical and computational perspectives. Furthermore, this discrete operator can be effectively generalized to the three-dimensional hyperbolic space.</description>
