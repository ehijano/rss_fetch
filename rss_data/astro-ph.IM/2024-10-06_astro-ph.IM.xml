      <title>The assembly, characterization, and performance of SISTINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) is a rocket-borne ultraviolet (UV) imaging spectrograph designed to probe the radiation environment of nearby stars. SISTINE operates over a bandpass of 98 -- 127 and 130 -- 158 nm, capturing a broad suite of emission lines tracing the full 10$^4$ -- 10$^5$ K formation temperature range critical for reconstructing the full UV radiation field incident on planets orbiting solar-type stars. SISTINE serves as a platform for key technology developments for future ultraviolet observatories. SISTINE operates at moderate resolving power ($R\sim$1500) while providing spectral imaging over an angular extent of $\sim$6', with $\sim$2" resolution at the slit center. The instrument is composed of an f/14 Cassegrain telescope that feeds a 2.1x magnifying spectrograph, utilizing a blazed holographically ruled diffraction grating and a powered fold mirror. Spectra are captured on a large format microchannel plate (MCP) detector consisting of two 113 x 42 mm segments each read out by a cross delay-line anode. Several novel technologies are employed in SISTINE to advance their technical maturity in support of future NASA UV/optical astronomy missions. These include enhanced aluminum lithium fluoride coatings (eLiF), atomic layer deposition (ALD) protective optical coatings, and ALD processed large format MCPs. SISTINE was launched a total of three times with two of the three launches successfully observing targets Procyon A and $\alpha$ Centauri A and B.</description>

      <title>The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) on Mars Express: a new science instrument made from an old webcam orbiting Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) is a small imaging instrument onboard Mars Express with a field of view of ~40x30 degrees. The camera was initially intended to provide visual confirmation of the separation of the Beagle 2 lander and has similar technical specifications to a typical webcam of the 2000s. In 2007, a few years after the end of its original mission, VMC was turned on again to obtain full-disk images of Mars to be used for outreach purposes. As VMC obtained more images, the scientific potential of the camera became evident, and in 2018 the camera was given an upgraded status of a new scientific instrument, with science goals in the field of Martian atmosphere meteorology. The wide Field of View of the camera combined with the orbit of Mars Express enable the acquisition of full-disk images of the planet showing different local times, which for a long time has been rare among orbital missions around Mars. The small data volume of images also allows videos that show the atmospheric dynamics of dust and cloud systems to be obtained. This paper is intended to be the new reference paper for VMC as a scientific instrument, and thus provides an overview of the updated procedures to plan, command and execute science observations of the Martian atmosphere. These observations produce valuable science data that is calibrated and distributed to the community for scientific use.</description>

      <title>Detection of a space capsule entering Earth's atmosphere with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 24 September 2023, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) Sample Return Capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere after successfully collecting samples from an asteroid. The known trajectory and timing of this return provided a rare opportunity to strategically instrument sites to record geophysical signals produced by the capsule as it traveled at hypersonic speeds through the atmosphere. We deployed two optical-fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) interrogators to sample over 12 km of surface-draped, fiber-optic cables along with six co-located seismometer-infrasound sensor pairs, spread across two sites near Eureka, NV. This campaign-style rapid deployment is the first reported recording of a sample return capsule entry with any distributed fiber optic sensing technology. The DAS interrogators recorded an impulsive arrival with an extended coda which had features that were similar to recordings from both the seismometers and infrasound sensors. While the signal-to-noise of the DAS data was lower than the seismic-infrasound data, the extremely dense spacing of fiber-optic sensors allowed for more phases to be clearly distinguished and the continuous transformation of the wavefront as it impacted the ground could be visualized. Unexpectedly, the DAS recordings contain less low-frequency content than is present in both the seismic and infrasound data. The deployment conditions strongly affected the recorded DAS data, in particular, we observed that fiber selection and placement exert strong controls on data quality.</description>

      <title>JASMINE image simulator for high-precision astrometry and photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JASMINE is a Japanese planned space mission that aims to reveal the formation history of our Galaxy and discover habitable exoEarths. For these objectives, the JASMINE satellite performs high-precision astrometric observations of the Galactic bulge and high-precision transit monitoring of M-dwarfs in the near-infrared (1.0-1.6 microns in wavelength). For feasibility studies, we develop an image simulation software named JASMINE-imagesim, which produces realistic observation images. This software takes into account various factors such as the optical point spread function (PSF), telescope jitter caused by the satellite's attitude control error (ACE), detector flat patterns, exposure timing differences between detector pixels, and various noise factors. As an example, we report a simulation for the feasibility study of astrometric observations using JASMINE-imagesim. The simulation confirms that the required position measurement accuracy of 4 mas for a single exposure of 12.5-mag objects is achievable if the telescope pointing jitter uniformly dilutes the PSF across all stars in the field of view. On the other hand, the simulation also demonstrates that the combination of realistic pointing jitter and exposure timing differences in the detector can significantly degrade accuracy and prevent achieving the requirement. This means that certain countermeasures against this issue must be developed. This result implies that this kind of simulation is important for mission planning and advanced developments to realize more realistic simulations help us to identify critical issues and also devise effective solutions.</description>

      <title>DRAFTS: A Deep Learning-Based Radio Fast Transient Search Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in radio astronomy is a complex task due to the challenges posed by radio frequency interference (RFI) and signal dispersion in the interstellar medium. Traditional search algorithms are often inefficient, time-consuming, and generate a high number of false positives. In this paper, we present DRAFTS, a deep learning-based radio fast transient search pipeline. DRAFTS integrates object detection and binary classification techniques to accurately identify FRBs in radio data. We developed a large, real-world dataset of FRBs for training deep learning models. The search test on FAST real observation data demonstrates that DRAFTS performs exceptionally in terms of accuracy, completeness, and search speed. In the re-search of FRB 20190520B observation data, DRAFTS detected more than three times the number of bursts compared to Heimdall, highlighting the potential for future FRB detection and analysis.</description>

      <title>Impact factors of astrophysics journals revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the 2024 impact factors of 36 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.</description>

      <title>A Laboratory Method for Measuring the Cross-Polarization in High-Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and related techniques have proven effective for coronagraphic exoplanet imaging. EFC creates a dark hole region in the image plane, allowing for the detection of faint planetary emissions. The quality of a dark hole is quantified by the contrast, i.e., the planet-to-star intensity ratio, that could be measured inside it. Inside the dark hole, the planet's light is distinguished from the residual starlight due to its incoherence. Cross polarization can cause the modulation of the starlight to behave differently than predicted, and can limit the achievable contrast. Sophisticated physical optics software can model the cross polarization for a fully specified optical system, but this does not obviate the need for measurements. This article presents realistic simulations of a novel laboratory-based method for measurements of the cross-polarization in a coronagraph. This capability may well prove useful for validating models of polarization effects. The proposed laboratory method is not much more demanding than current efforts on the high-contrast testbeds, yet the simulation results demonstrate highly accurate estimates of the electric field corresponding to the cross polarization in a dark hole. These encouraging results suggest viable laboratory implementation. The proposed method uses a laser and two linear polarizers to isolate the cross polarization. A nonlinear probing scheme addresses polarizer leakage. Simulations are performed for an aberrated Lyot coronagraph with an initial dark hole contrast of $\sim 10^{-10}$ and cross-polarization electric fields corresponding to intensities of $\sim 10^{-11}$ in contrast units. The primary application of this method is likely laboratory validation of digital twin models for cross-polarization. On-sky, the experimentally validated models could then be used to account for cross polarization.</description>

      <title>Along the Primary Curve: Simultaneous Source and Lens Reconstruction of Bright Arcs in Cluster Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon arising when light rays are deflected by the mass between the source and the observer. Largely magnified and highly distorted images of background galaxies are formed by these angular deflections if the deflecting mass distribution and the background sources align. As the most massive gravitationally bound objects in the universe, galaxy clusters are places where such alignments are usually found. By carefully analyzing the images of lensed galaxies, one can measure the mass, both visible and invisible, along the line-of-sight. These measurements are crucial in investigating the nature of dark matter, which constitutes most of the mass within clusters. Existing lensing analysis methods typically forward model the multiple images of dozens of background galaxies lensed by the cluster. To make this forward modeling computationally tractable, these multiple images are reduced to a much smaller summary data vector, which includes the locations, magnifications, and distortions. Our work avoids this loss of information by forward modeling the data at pixel-level. We develop a parametric model for the angular deflections near the bright arcs that allows us to control the shape of the curve that gives the directions of the eigenvectors of the Jacobian of the lensing matrix. The bright and extended images often follow such curves. We apply our analysis method to the bright arcs in gravitational lenses SDSS J1110+6459 and SDSS J0004-0103. We present our lens and source reconstructions for each system. With the application of our new method to many other lensing systems, we anticipate significant improvement in lens modeling near the critical curve, which will provide higher precision mass reconstructions for the deflectors. High-precision lens models allow for more robust de-lensing, which aids the studies of various highly magnified sources.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <title>sunset: A database of synthetic atmospheric-escape transmission spectra for nearly every transiting planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying atmospheric escape from exoplanets can provide important clues about the formation and evolution of exoplanets. Observational evidence of atmospheric escape has been obtained through transit spectroscopy in strong spectral lines of various atomic species. In recent years, the number of exoplanets that have been targeted in this way has grown rapidly, mainly by observations of the metastable helium triplet. Even with this larger sample of exoplanets, many aspects of atmospheric escape remain not fully understood, such as the role of the stellar high-energy spectrum and planetary magnetic field, highlighting the need for additional observations. This work aims to identify the best targets for observations in various spectral lines. Using the atmospheric escape code sunbather, we calculate a synthetic transmission spectrum of nearly every transiting exoplanet currently known. This database of spectra, named sunset, is publicly available. We introduce metrics based on the spectral line strengths and system distance or magnitude, which allow swift identification of the most favorable targets. By analyzing the complete set of spectra from a demographic perspective, we find that the strengths of many spectral lines do not correlate strongly with the atmospheric mass-loss rate, suggesting that a nondetection does not immediately rule out an escaping atmosphere. Our model spectra show only a weak correlation between the XUV (X-ray and extreme UV) flux and the helium line strength, affirming that the absence of such a trend found by observational works is in fact as expected. A direct comparison between our synthetic spectra and the sample of observed metastable helium spectra shows that they are generally consistent within the large model uncertainties. This suggests that by and large, photoevaporation is able to explain the current metastable helium census.</description>

      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the advancement of research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. The communication constellation can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This paper studies the two challenges of the communication constellation, continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For the continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between the adjacent orbital planes derives the analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellation is classified into a quasi-symmetric and optimal constellation. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized by the BILP algorithm. As a result, the simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>

      <title>HALO: A High-Precision Orbit Propagation Tool for Mission Design in the Cis-Lunar Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent implementation of the Artemis Accords, interest in the cis-lunar space is rapidly increasing, necessitating the development of more precise and accurate modeling tools. While general-purpose mission design tools are available, this study proposes an open-source mission design tool, HALO, for High-precision Analyser for Lunar Orbits. This work presents a comprehensive review of the modeling approaches, structural design, and algorithms employed, aiming at facilitating ease of use and adaptation for other research in the cis-lunar domain. Furthermore, accuracy studies of the propagator are provided for various orbits of interest within this domain, including low lunar orbits, elliptical frozen orbits, and 3-body problem orbits, such as Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits and Distant Retrograde Orbits.</description>

      <title>A General, Differentiable Transit Model for Ellipsoidal Occulters: Derivation, Application, and Forecast of Planetary Oblateness and Obliquity Constraints with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly precise space-based photometry uncovers higher-order effects in transits, eclipses and phase curves which can be used to characterize exoplanets in novel ways. The subtle signature induced by a rotationally deformed exoplanet is determined by the planet's oblateness and rotational obliquity, which provide a wealth of information about a planet's formation, internal structure, and dynamical history. However, these quantities are often strongly degenerate and require sophisticated methods to convincingly constrain. We develop a new semi-analytic model for an ellipsoidal object occulting a spherical body with arbitrary surface maps expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. We implement this model in an open-source Jax-based Python package eclipsoid, allowing just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation. We then estimate the precision obtainable with JWST observations of the long period planet population and demonstrate the best current candidates for studies of oblateness and obliquity. We test our method on the JWST NIRSpec transit of the inflated warm Neptune WASP-107 b and place an upper bound on its projected oblateness $f&lt;0.23$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}}&gt;13$h if the planet is not inclined to our line of sight. Further studies of long-period exoplanets will necessitate discarding the assumption of planets as spherical bodies. Eclipsoid provides a general framework allowing rotational deformation to be modelled in transits, occultations, phase curves, transmission spectra and more.</description>

      <title>Characterization of monosubstituted benzene ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aromatic structures are fundamental for key biological molecules such as RNA and metabolites and the abundances of aromatic molecules on young planets are therefore of high interest. Recent detections of benzonitrile and other aromatic compounds in interstellar clouds and comets have revealed a rich aromatic astrochemistry. In the cold phases of star and planet formation, most of these aromatic molecules are likely to reside in icy grain mantles, where they could be observed through IR spectroscopy. We present laboratory IR spectra of benzene and four monosubstituted benzene molecules -- toluene, phenol, benzonitrile and benzaldehyde -- to determine their IR ice absorbances in undiluted aromatic ices, and in mixtures with water and CO. We also characterize the aromatic ice desorption rates, and extract binding energies and respective pre-exponential factors using temperature programmed desorption experiments. We use these to predict at which protostellar and protoplanetary disk temperatures these molecules sublimate into the gas-phase. We find that benzene and mono-substituted benzene derivatives are low-volatility with binding energies in the 5220-8390 K (43-70 kJ/mol) range, which suggests that most of the chemistry of benzene and of functionalized aromatic molecules is to be expected to occur in the ice phase during star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Orbit Parameterization in Spherical Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel orbit parameterization in spherical coordinates. This parameterization enables the mixing of varying and invariant orbital parameters, and clarifies the physics of the orbit. It also simplifies the process of placing synthetic populations at exactly specified locations on the sky, which is particularly useful for survey design and simulation studies.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Beyond Limber Angular power Spectra Toolkit. A fast and efficient algorithm for 3x2 pt analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys is approaching, bringing more data with tighter error bars. As a result, theoretical models will become more complex, incorporating additional parameters, which will increase the dimensionality of the parameter space and make posteriors more challenging to explore. Consequently, the need to improve and speed up our current analysis pipelines will grow. In this work, we focus on the 3x2 pt statistics, a summary statistic that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its great constraining power. These statistics involve calculating angular two-point correlation functions for the auto- and cross-correlations between galaxy clustering and weak lensing. The corresponding model is determined by integrating the product of the power spectrum and two highly-oscillating Bessel functions over three dimensions, which makes the evaluation particularly challenging. Typically, this difficulty is circumvented by employing the so-called Limber approximation, which is an important source of error. We present Blast.jl, an innovative and efficient algorithm for calculating angular power spectra without employing the Limber approximation or assuming a scale-dependent growth rate, based on the use of Chebyshev polynomials. The algorithm is compared with the publicly available beyond-Limber codes, whose performances were recently tested by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration in the N5K challenge. At similar accuracy, Blast.jl is $\approx 10$-$15 \times$ faster than the winning method of the challenge, also showing excellent scaling with respect to various hyper-parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce a new photometric calibration for the combined six-filter system formed by $Gaia$ DR2 + EDR3 $G$+$G_{\rm BP}$+$G_{\rm RP}$ using an improved STIS/HST spectrophotometric library with very red stars. The comparison between observed and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7 mmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range optical photometric system ever obtained. We include some tests and applications.</description>

      <title>Scattering Spectra Models for Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physicists routinely need probabilistic models for a number of tasks such as parameter inference or the generation of new realizations of a field. Establishing such models for highly non-Gaussian fields is a challenge, especially when the number of samples is limited. In this paper, we introduce scattering spectra models for stationary fields and we show that they provide accurate and robust statistical descriptions of a wide range of fields encountered in physics. These models are based on covariances of scattering coefficients, i.e. wavelet decomposition of a field coupled with a point-wise modulus. After introducing useful dimension reductions taking advantage of the regularity of a field under rotation and scaling, we validate these models on various multi-scale physical fields and demonstrate that they reproduce standard statistics, including spatial moments up to 4th order. These scattering spectra provide us with a low-dimensional structured representation that captures key properties encountered in a wide range of physical fields. These generic models can be used for data exploration, classification, parameter inference, symmetry detection, and component separation.</description>

      <title>How the Galaxy-Halo Connection Depends on Large-Scale Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale environments at $z=0$ with Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation data. We predict stellar masses from subhalo properties to test two types of machine learning (ML) models: Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) with simple galaxy environment features and $\mathbb{E}(3)$-invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). The best-performing EBM models leverage spherically averaged overdensity features on $3$ Mpc scales. Interpretations via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) also suggest that, in the context of the TNG300 galaxy-halo connection, simple spherical overdensity on $\sim 3$ Mpc scales is more important than cosmic web distance features measured using the DisPerSE algorithm. Meanwhile, a GNN with connectivity defined by a fixed linking length, $L$, outperforms the EBM models by a significant margin. As we increase the linking length scale, GNNs learn important environmental contributions up to the largest scales we probe ($L=10$ Mpc). We conclude that $3$ Mpc distance scales are most critical for describing the TNG galaxy-halo connection using the spherical overdensity parameterization but that information on larger scales, which is not captured by simple environmental parameters or cosmic web features, can further augment these models. Our study highlights the benefits of using interpretable ML algorithms to explain models of astrophysical phenomena, and the power of using GNNs to flexibly learn complex relationships directly from data while imposing constraints from physical symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Villafranca project: Combining Gaia and ground-based surveys to study Galactic OB groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.</description>

      <title>Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC): A Tool for Retrieving and Modeling Multi-temporal, Multi-wavelength and Multi-messenger Data from Blazar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC) is a web-based tool designed for accessing and retrieving multiwavelength and multimessenger data from blazar observations. MMDC facilitates the construction and interactive visualization of time-resolved multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars by integrating: \textit{(i)} archival data from over 80 catalogs and databases, \textit{(ii)} optical data from all-sky survey facilities such as ASAS-SN, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS, and \textit{(iii)} newly analyzed datasets in the optical/UV band from \textit{Swift}-UVOT, in the X-ray band from \textit{Swift}-XRT and NuSTAR observations, and the high-energy $\gamma$-ray band from \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations. MMDC distinguishes itself from other online platforms by the large quantity of available data. For instance, it includes data from all blazar observations by \textit{Swift} and NuSTAR, as well as the results of detailed spectral analysis in the $\gamma$-ray band during different emission states, covering the period from 2008 to 2023. Another important distinguishing feature of MMDC is its ability to enable precise, self-consistent theoretical modeling of the observed data using machine learning algorithms trained on leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, which consider the injection of particles and all relevant cooling processes. MMDC is an innovative tool which significantly enhances blazar research by providing a comprehensive framework for data accessibility, analysis, and theoretical interpretation, thereby advancing our understanding of blazar emissions and the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>
