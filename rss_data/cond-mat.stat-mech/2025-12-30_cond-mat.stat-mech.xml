      <title>Structural changes in the Lennard-Jones supercooled liquid and ideal glass: an improved integral equation for the replica method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Framing the glass formation within standard statistical mechanics is an outstanding problem of condensed matter theory. To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order.</description>

      <title>Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to DP. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behaviour in socio-economic and active systems.</description>

      <title>On the Cocycle Structure of the Boltzmann Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a cocycle structure, we identify a new derivation of the Boltzmann distribution for finite energy-level systems from the maximal entropy principle (MEP). Our approach does not rely on the method of the Lagrange multiplier, and it provides a more transparent way to understand the dependence on the energy levels of the temperature $T = 1/\beta$ for the equilibrium distribution. Finally, we make two curious observations associated with our derivations.</description>

      <title>Geometric decomposition of information flow for overdamped Langevin systems and optimal transport in subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information flow between subsystems is a central concept in information thermodynamics, which provides the second-law-like inequalities for subsystems. This paper discusses the geometric decomposition of information flow, which was introduced for Markov jump systems [Y Maekawa, R Nagayama, K Yoshimura and S Ito, arXiv:2509.21985 (2025)], and applies it to overdamped Langevin systems. For overdamped Langevin systems, the geometric decomposition of information flow into excess and housekeeping contributions is related to the conventional definition of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between marginal distributions in optimal transport theory. This formulation offers an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics, and this optimal-transport formulation is simpler for overdamped Langevin systems than for general Markov jump systems. It is also possible to handle features that are specific to overdamped Langevin systems, such as representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition, as well as their relationship with the Fisher information matrix. As with the results for Markov jump systems, we generalize the second law of information thermodynamics using housekeeping and excess information flow, leading to the concept of excess and housekeeping demons. We also derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit incorporating excess information flow. These results are illustrated for the Gaussian case, and we discuss the conditions under which the excess and housekeeping demons emerge.</description>

      <title>Effective Kinetic Monte Carlo for a Quantum Epidemic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by previous works on epidemic-like processes in open quantum systems, we derive an elementary quantum epidemic model that is simple enough to be studied via Quantum Jump Monte Carlo simulations at reasonably large system sizes. We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection.</description>

      <title>Phase transition revealed by eigen microstate entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the eigen microstate entropy ($S_{\text{EM}}$), a novel metric of complexity derived from the probabilities of statistically independent eigen microstates. After establishing its scaling behavior in equilibrium systems and demonstrating its utility in critical phenomena (mean spherical, Ising, and Potts models), we apply $S_{\text{EM}}$ to non-equilibrium complex systems. Our analysis reveals a consistent precursor signal: a significant increase in $S_{\text{EM}}$ precedes major phase transitions. Specifically, we observe this entropy rise before biomolecular condensate formation in liquid-liquid phase separation in living cells and months ahead of El Ni\~no events. These findings position $S_{\text{EM}}$ as a general framework for detecting and interpreting phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Foundations of Microcanonical Thermodynamics: Entropy Flow Equation and Thermodynamic Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric foundation of microcanonical thermodynamics in which entropy and its derivatives are determined from the geometry of phase space, rather than being introduced through an a priori ensemble postulate. Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy.
  Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^\alpha$ interactions.</description>

      <title>Survey on Lattice Gas Models on 2D Lattices: Critical Behavior of Closed Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz lattice gases (LLGs) are discrete-time transport models in which a point particle moves ballistically between lattice sites and is scattered by randomly placed, quenched local scatterers such as ``rotators'' or ``mirrors.'' Despite the elementary update rules, LLGs exhibit rich dynamical regimes: typically, trajectories close quickly and the distribution of loop lengths has exponential tails, but at special concentrations of scatterers one observes critical behavior with scale-free statistics and fractal geometry. This survey focuses on the critical behavior of closed trajectories in two-dimensional LLGs, starting from the numerical study of Cao and Cohen, and its relation to percolation-hull scaling and kinetic hull-generating walks. We highlight the scaling hypothesis for loop-length distributions, the emergence of critical exponents $\tau=15/7$, $d_f=7/4$, and $\sigma=3/7$ in several universality classes, and the appearance of alternative exponents in partially occupied models.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group approach to graphene bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach, following the pioneering work of Mauri et al. [Phys. Rev. B 102, 165421 (2020)] based on a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA). We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim \ell^{2}(\lambda+2\mu)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim 2\kappa$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations.</description>

      <title>Universal Aging Dynamics and Scaling Laws in Three-Dimensional Driven Granular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish universal scaling laws and quantify aging in three-dimensional uniformly heated hard sphere granular gases through large-scale event-driven molecular dynamics ($N=500{,}000$). We report three primary quantitative discoveries: (i) The characteristic energy decay time exhibits a universal inverse scaling $\tau_0 \propto \epsilon^{-1.03 \pm 0.02}$ with the dissipation parameter $\epsilon = 1 - e^2$. (ii) The steady-state temperature follows a precise power-law $T_{\mathrm{steady}} \propto \epsilon^{-1.51 \pm 0.03}$, reflecting the non-linear balance between thermostat heating and collisional dissipation. (iii) The velocity autocorrelation function $\bar{A}(\tau_w, \tau)$ demonstrates pronounced aging, with decay rates $\lambda$ following a power-law slowing down $\lambda(\tau_w) \propto \tau_w^{-0.82 \pm 0.05}$. These results establish the first 3D quantitative benchmarks for aging in driven dissipative gases, where near-Gaussian statistics persist despite extreme structural clustering.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity Breaking in Active Run-and-Tumble Particles in a Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a run-and-tumble particle in a double-well potential and demonstrate that, in stark contrast to Brownian particles, active dynamics can lead to strong ergodicity breaking. When the barrier height exceeds a critical threshold, the long-time position distribution depends crucially on the initial condition: if the particle starts within the basin of attraction of one well, it remains trapped there, while if it begins between the two basins, it can reach either well with a finite probability, which we compute exactly via hitting probabilities. Below the critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution, which we derive analytically. Using this result, we also estimate the characteristic barrier crossing time and show that it violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law, and displays a divergence near the critical height following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like form with an anomalous exponent $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Wigner Cat Phases: A finely tunable system for exploring the transition to quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.</description>

      <title>Discrete equations and auto-traveling kinks of the $\phi^6$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\phi^{6}$ model and derive two broad classes of lattice discretizations that admit static, translationally invariant kinks; that is, stationary kink profiles that can be centered at an arbitrary position relative to the lattice. These discretizations are constructed using a one-dimensional map, $\phi_{n+1}=F(\phi_{n})$, which provides a direct and systematic algorithm for generating such models. Numerical computations for two representative cases show that the discrete kinks do not possess internal modes, consistent with the continuum theory, although an additional high-frequency mode may appear above the phonon band. We also show that generic discretizations of the $\phi^{6}$ model do not support static kink solutions. Instead, the resulting dynamics produce auto-traveling and self-accelerating kinks that propagate at the maximal group velocity while continuously emitting radiation.</description>

      <title>Thermal Equilibrium Vacancy Concentration in an Alloy with Chemical Short-Range Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium vacancy concentration in multi-principal element alloys remains a controversial and nontrivial subject, primarily because of chemical complexity and chemical short-range order (CSRO). Here we derive an exact expression that is amenable to atomistic calculations, using multiple perspectives. We applied this expression to equiatomic CrCoNi alloys in the face-centered cubic structure. The derived equilibrium vacancy concentration is used in our recent work, which predicts the chemical short-range order formation timescale consistent with experimental observation. The results demonstrate the practical utility of the approach for predicting equilibrium vacancy concentrations in compositionally complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Non-Affine Rearrangements in Amorphous Glass: Emergence of Intrinsic Length Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of temperature-driven nonaffine rearrangements in a model amorphous solid across the full thermodynamic range, from a high-temperature liquid, through supercooled and sub-glass regimes, into deep glassy states. The central result is a quantitative characterisation of the componentwise nonaffine residual displacements, obtained by subtracting local affine maps from particle displacements. For each state point the tails of the probability distributions of these nonaffine components display clear exponential decay; linear fits to the logarithm of the tail region yield characteristic nonaffine length scales {\xi}NA,x and {\xi}NA,y , which quantify the spatial extent of purely nonaffine, local rearrangements. To compare with other length scales, we compute van Hove distributions Gx(ux), Gy (uy ) which capture the full particle displacement field (coherent affine-like motion plus residuals). A robust, key finding is that the van Hove length scale consistently exceeds the filtered nonaffine length scale, i.e. {\xi}VH &gt; {\xi}NA, across all temperatures, state points, and densities we studied. The nonaffine length {\xi}NA quantifies the distance over which complex deformation occurs, specifically nonlinear and anharmonic responses, irreversible (plastic) rearrangements, topological non-recoverable particle rearrangements, and other residual motions that cannot be represented by a local affine map. Moreover, near equality of {\xi}NA,x and {\xi}NA,y in all conditions provides further evidence that nonaffine rearrangements propagate isotropically under thermally driven deformation in contrast to externally driven shear.</description>

      <title>Measuring out-of-time-order correlators on a quantum computer based on an irreversibility-susceptibility method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Switching Transition in a Resource Exchange Model on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a simple nonequilibrium system with many interconnected, open subsystems, each exchanging a globally conserved resource with an external reserve. The system is represented by a random graph, where nodes represent the subsystems connected through edges. At each time step, a randomly selected node gains a token (i.e, a resource) from the reserve with probability (1-p) or loses a token to the reserve with probability p. When a node loses a token, its neighbors also lose a token each. This asymmetric token exchange breaks the detailed balance. We investigate the steady state behavior of our model for different types of random graphs: graphs without edges, regular graphs, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, and Barab\'asi-Albert graphs. In all cases, the system exhibits a sharp, switch-like transition between a token-saturated state and an empty state. When the control parameter p is below a critical threshold, almost all tokens accumulate on the graph. Furthermore, in a non-regular graph, most tokens accumulate or condense on nodes of minimum degree. A slight increase in p beyond the threshold drains almost all the tokens from the graph. This switching transition results from the interplay between drift and the conservation of tokens. However, the position of the critical threshold and the behavior at the transition zone depend on graph topology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Threshold for Fracton Codes and Nearly Saturated Code Capacity in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Random matrix prediction of average entanglement entropy in non-Abelian symmetry sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the average bipartite entanglement entropy of Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry, constrained to fixed total spin $J$ and magnetization $J_z = 0$. Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.</description>

      <title>MO-HEOM: Extending Hierarchical Equations of Motion to Molecular Orbital Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of quantum thermal effects on molecular excitation dynamics have often relied on oversimplified models, such as energy eigenstates or low-dimensional potentials, which fail to capture the complexity of real chemical systems. In reality, molecules are spatially extended and embedded in anisotropic environments, where molecular orbitals (MOs) play a central role in determining quantum behavior. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model within the MO framework, with explicit inclusion of intramolecular vibrational motion. From this MO foundation, we derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM). As a demonstration, we analyze hydrogen molecules and hydrogen molecular ions with vibrational degrees of freedom, revealing their linear absorption spectra.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Replica-symmetric Saddle Point for Ising Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the replica-symmetric saddle point equations for the Ising perceptron with Gaussian disorder and margin $\kappa\ge 0$. We prove that for each $\kappa\ge 0$ there is a critical capacity $\alpha_c(\kappa)=\frac{2}{\pi\,\mathbb E[(\kappa-Z)_+^2]}$, where $Z$ is a standard normal and $(x)_+=\max\{x,0\}$, such that the saddle point equation has a unique solution for $\alpha\in(0,\alpha_c(\kappa))$ and has no solution when $\alpha\ge \alpha_c(\kappa)$. When $\alpha\uparrow \alpha_c(\kappa)$ and $\kappa&gt;0$, the replica-symmetric free energy at this solution diverges to $-\infty$. In the zero-margin case $\kappa=0$, Ding and Sun obtained a conditional uniqueness result, with one step verified numerically. Our argument gives a fully analytic proof without computer assistance. We used GPT-5 to help develop intermediate proof steps and to perform sanity-check computations.</description>

      <title>The five-vertex model as a discrete log-gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the five-vertex model on a rectangular domain of the square lattice, with the so-called `scalar-product' boundary conditions. We address the evaluation of the free-energy density of the model in the scaling limit, that is when the number of sites is sent to infinity and the mesh of the lattice to zero, while keeping the size of the domain constant. To this aim, we reformulate the partition function of the model in terms of a discrete log-gas, and study its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit. We reproduce previous results, obtained by using a differential equation approach. Moreover, we provide the explicit form of the resolvent in all possible regimes. This work is preliminary to further studies of limit shape phenomena in the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new class of integrable 3D lattice models, possessing continuous families of commuting layer-to-layer transfer matrices. Algebraically, this commutativity is based on a very special construction of local Boltzmann weights in terms of quantum dilogarithms satisfying the inversion and pentagon identities. We give three examples of such quantum dilogarithms, leading to integrable 3D lattice models. The partition function per site in these models can be exactly calculated in the limit of an infinite lattice by using the functional relations, symmetry and factorization properties of the transfer matrix. The results of such calculations for 3D models associated with the Faddeev modular quantum dilogarithm are briefly presented.</description>

      <title>Universal Entanglement Growth along Imaginary Time in Quantum Critical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.</description>

      <title>From geometry to dynamics: Learning overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparse observations with geometric constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we learn the laws underlying the dynamics of stochastic systems when their trajectories are sampled sparsely in time? Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple and accurate approach to estimate the random close packing (RCP) fraction of binary hard-disk mixtures. By introducing a parameter based on the reduced third virial coefficient of the mixture, we show that the RCP fraction depends nearly linearly on this parameter, leading to a universal collapse of simulation data across a wide range of size ratios and compositions. Comparisons with previous models by Brouwers and Zaccone demonstrate that our approach provides the most consistent and accurate predictions. The method can be naturally extended to polydisperse mixtures with continuous size distributions, offering a robust framework for understanding the universality of RCP in hard-disk systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless deconfinement in super-Coulombic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents of the Ising model with quenched structural disorder and long-range interactions at spatial dimension $d=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the critical properties of a weakly diluted (random) Ising model with the long-range interaction decaying with distance $x$ as $\sim x^{-d-\sigma}$ in a $d$-dimensional space. It is known to belong to a new long-range random universality class for certain values of the decay parameter $\sigma$. Exploiting the field-theoretic renormalization group approach within the minimal subtraction scheme, we compute the three-loop renormalization group functions. On their basis, with the help of asymptotic series resummation methods, we estimate the correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ characterising the new universality class for $d=3$ and for those values of $\sigma$ for which long-range interactions are relevant for the critical behaviour.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:cond-mat/0009042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we present a new approach to the numerical valuation of derivative securities. The method is based on our previous work where we formulated the theory of pricing in terms of tradables. The basic idea is to fit a finite difference scheme to exact solutions of the pricing PDE. This can be done in a very elegant way, due to the fact that in our tradable based formulation there appear no drift terms in the PDE. We construct a mixed scheme based on this idea and apply it to price various types of arithmetic Asian options, as well as plain vanilla options (both european and american style) on stocks paying known cash dividends. We find prices which are accurate to $\sim 0.1%$ in about 10ms on a Pentium 233MHz computer and to $\sim 0.001%$ in a second. The scheme can also be used for market conform pricing, by fitting it to observed option prices.</description>

Abstract: Discovery of electron hydrodynamics in graphene system has opened a new scope of analytic calculations in condensed matter physics, which was traditionally well cultivated in science and engineering as a non-relativistic hydrodynamics and in high energy nuclear and astro physics as relativistic hydrodynamics. Electrons in graphene follow neither non-relativistic nor relativistic hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Present article has gone through systematic microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed. The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a solid-based to a fluid-based picture. This understanding may be connected to the experimentally observed Wiedemann-Franz Law violation in the Dirac fluid domain of graphene system.</description>

      <title>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</description>

      <title>The i.i.d. State Convertibility in the Resource Theory of Asymmetry for Finite Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify exact and approximate conversion rates between i.i.d. pure states under covariant operations in the resource theory of asymmetry for symmetries described by finite groups. We establish the formula for the exact conversion rate by completely specifying the relevant set of resource measures. The exact conversion is generally asymptotically irreversible due to the existence of multiple independent resource measures, and we find the necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic reversibility. On the other hand, we show that the approximate conversion rates diverge or vanish, which implies that the asymmetry can be infinitely amplified if we allow a vanishingly small error. We reveal the underlying mechanism of such a counterintuitive phenomenon by utilizing the properties of maximally asymmetric states.</description>

      <title>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>Concentration via metastable mixing, with applications to the supercritical exponential random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Folklore belief holds that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

Abstract: The study of active solids offers a window into the mechanics and thermodynamics of dense living matter. A key aspect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such active systems is a mechanistic description of how the underlying mechano-chemical couplings arise, which cannot be resolved in models that are phenomenologically constructed. Here, we follow a bottom-up theoretical approach to develop a thermodynamically consistent active solid (TCAS) model, and uncover a non-trivial cross-talk that naturally ensues between mechanical response and dissipation. In particular, we show that dissipation reaches a maximum at finite stresses, while it is inhibited under large stresses, effectively reverting the system to a passive state. Our findings establish a generic mechanism plausibly responsible for the non-monotonic behaviour observed in recent experimental measurements of entropy production rate in an actomyosin material and enzymatic activity in crowded condensates.</description>

      <title>Model of luminescence and delayed luminescence correlated blinking in single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals</title>

Abstract: Cesium lead halide nanocrystals and quantum dots are prominent materials for different types of applications because of their remarkable photophysical properties. However, they are also known to exhibit the same effects observed for non-perovskite colloidal semiconductor quantum dots such as blinking, photobleaching, delayed luminescence, etc. In this study we reveal the correlations between fast and delayed emission components for both the intensity and characteristic decay time for single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals. In order to explain the phenomena observed, we propose a novel model of single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals luminescence blinking based on the hypothesis of slow variations in the electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg magnet on four three-dimensional lattices - simple-cubic, diamond, pyrochlore, and hyperkagome ones - for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic signs of the exchange interaction in order to illustrate the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature thermodynamic properties with a focus on the specific heat $c(T)$. To this end, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Field Theory of the Rate Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the statistical inference of a time-dependent rate of events in the framework of Bayesian field theory. This maps the problem to a Langevin equation which, beyond the local linear regime taken as reference, involves nonlinearities and an explicit dependence on the local shape of the maximum likelihood curve. We study the corresponding impacts in a perturbative expansion, formulating a scaling hypothesis for the order of shape corrections. We find that the pure nonlinearities dominate the mean and skewness. Crucially, we uncover that the leading correction to the variance is driven by noise propagation from the signal's effective curvature. We test the derived expansion with numerical simulations and illustrate its applicability on real neural spike data.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion: Analysis in time and frequency domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel construction of the two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (2D fBm) with dependent components. Unlike similar models discussed in the literature, our approach uniquely accommodates the full range of model parameters and explicitly incorporates cross-dependencies and anisotropic scaling through a matrix-valued Hurst operator. We thoroughly analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed causal and well-balanced 2D fBm versions, deriving their auto- and cross-covariance structures in both time and frequency domains. In particular, we present the power spectral density of these processes and their increments. Our analytical findings are validated with numerical simulations. This work provides a comprehensive framework for modeling anomalous diffusion phenomena in multidimensional systems where component interdependencies are crucial.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to find reliable and efficient numerical approximation schemes, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of one-particle irreducible two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. Based on this reformulation and reinterpretation we adopt a numerical scheme for the solution of field-dependent flow equations as nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more interesting problems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermalization and time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate formation in ultracold Dy-164 using a nonlinear boson diffusion equation. As compared to alkali atoms such as K-39 or Rb-87, the strong magnetic dipole interaction modifies the scattering-length dependence of the transport coefficients that govern thermalization and condensate formation. A prediction for the time-dependent condensate fraction in Dy-164 is made.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that the polar alignment interaction is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics. This constraint naturally generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. These results classify chiral active matter as a dissipative spintronic fluid, revealing that the transition to active turbulence is the emergence of a topological quasiparticle gas, where macroscopic Onsager dipoles acquire effective inertia from the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spiral states, first-order transitions and specific heat multipeak phenomenon in $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model: A Wang-Landau algorithm study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is important for understanding frustrated magnetic phenomena in materials such as FePS$_3$ and Ba$_2$CoTeO$_6$, where diverse phases (e.g., striped, zigzag, armchair) and magnetization plateaus have been experimentally observed. To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and specific-heat multipeak phenomenon.</description>
