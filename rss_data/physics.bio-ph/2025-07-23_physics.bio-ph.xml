      <title>General mechanism for concentration-based cell size control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells control their size to cope with noise during growth and division. Eukaryotic cells exhibiting "sizer" control (targeting a specific size before dividing) are thought to rely on molecular concentration thresholds, but simple implementations of this strategy are not stable. We derive a general criterion for concentration-based sizer control and demonstrate it with a mechanistic model that resolves the instability by using multistage progression towards division. We show that if at least one stage has concentration dynamics that are a pure function of size, then sizer control follows for the whole progression. We predict that perturbations to the dynamics shift the size statistics without disrupting sizer control, consistent with recent experiments on fission yeast.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal organization of chemical oscillators via phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study chemical oscillators in the presence of phase separation. By imposing timescale separation between slow reactions and fast diffusion, we define a dynamics at phase equilibrium for the relevant degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that phase separation affects reaction kinetics by localizing reactants within phases, allowing for control of oscillator frequency and amplitude. The analysis is validated with a spatial model. Finally, relaxing the timescale separation between reactions and diffusion leads to waves of phase equilibria at mesoscopic scales.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Collective Memory in Schooling Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schooling fish often self-organize into a variety of collective patterns, from polarized schooling to rotational milling. Mathematical models support the emergence of these large-scale patterns from local decentralized interactions, in the absence of individual memory and group leadership. In a popular model where individual fish interact locally following rules of avoidance, alignment, and attraction, the group exhibits collective memory: changes in individual behavior lead to emergent patterns that depend on the group's past configurations. However, the mechanisms driving this collective memory remain obscure. Here, we combine numerical simulations with tools from bifurcation theory to uncover that the transition from milling to schooling in this model is driven by a noisy transcritical bifurcation where the two collective states intersect and exchange stability. We further show that key features of the group dynamics - the bifurcation character, transient milling, and collective memory - can be captured by a phenomenological model of the group polarization. Our findings demonstrate that collective memory arises from a noisy bifurcation rather than from structural bistability, thus resolving a long-standing ambiguity about its origins and contributing fundamental understanding to collective phase transitions in a prevalent model of fish schooling.</description>

      <title>A Taylor swimming sheet under a finite Brinkman layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An asymptotic approach is employed to study the swimming speed of a two-dimensional Taylor swimming sheet beneath a Brinkman layer of finite thickness. This configuration is representative of a swimmer confined within a porous non-Newtonian boundary and could model microscopic filter feeders like choanoflagellates and sponges or the mucociliary escalator in the lungs. When ignoring the effects of jump stress and porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet decreases as the thickness and lower boundary of the Brinkman layer increase. The same is true as the permeability of the layer decreases. Including porosity effects with a zero jump stress enhances the swimming velocity of the sheet for porosity values near unity and decreases the swimming velocity for smaller porosity values. In the absence of porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet increases for positive-valued jump stresses and decreases for negative ones. Coupling nonzero jump stress with a variable porosity establishes complex behavior, with the sheet's swimming speed attaining a maximum, surpassing that found for the Newtonian case, particularly in thin or low-permeability Brinkman layers.</description>

      <title>Exact model of aerotactic band: From Fokker-Planck equation to band structure and fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of bacterial species spontaneously assemble in aerotactic band, local accumulation at a fixed distance from the air-water interface. Although the phenomenon is long known, its modelling is so far limited to mesoscopic, one-dimensional or numerical descriptions. We investigate band properties at the microscopic scale using exact solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. First, we show that the interplay between oxygen consumption and tumbling modulation is governed by a third-order nonlinear differential equation relating the oxygen concentration to the aerotactic response. For two model aerotactic behaviors, we present analytical solutions and discuss the resulting band structure. Second, we investigate how an aerotactic band of magnetotactic bacteria in a magnetic field induces a spontaneous fluid flow, as observed in experiments [Marmol et al, arXiv 2025]. In the low field limit, we determine the bacterial distribution and the active stress tensor. Using the Green function of the hydrodynamic problem, we obtain a prediction for the fluid flow that is both simple and consistent with observations. Altogether, our results provide a model system of aerotactic band and solid ground to analyze aerotaxis-driven self-organization.</description>

      <title>Building Intuition for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Simple Model and the Cavity Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) is a powerful theoretical framework for analyzing systems with many interacting degrees of freedom. This tutorial provides an accessible introduction to DMFT. We begin with a linear model where the DMFT equations can be derived exactly, allowing readers to develop clear intuition for the underlying principles. We then introduce the cavity method, a versatile approach for deriving DMFT equations for non-linear systems. The tutorial concludes with an application to the generalized Lotka--Volterra model of interacting species, demonstrating how DMFT reduces the complex dynamics of many-species communities to a tractable single-species stochastic process. Key insights include understanding how quenched disorder enables the reduction from many-body to effective single-particle dynamics, recognizing the role of self-averaging in simplifying complex systems, and seeing how collective interactions give rise to non-Markovian feedback effects.</description>

      <title>Universal Response Inequalities Beyond Steady States via Trajectory Information Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10952v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-dissipation relations elucidate the response of near-equilibrium systems to environmental changes, with recent advances extending response theory to non-equilibrium steady states. However, a general response theory for systems evolving far from steady states has remained elusive. This letter presents a complete trajectory information geometric framework that generalizes response theory for non-stationary Markov processes. By constructing the full trajectory probability manifold and identifying a globally orthogonal coordinate system defined by transition rates, we derive a diagonal Fisher information metric that enables explicit calculations in this high-dimensional space. From the local metric structure, we obtain a Cramer-Rao-type inequality that bounds the linear response of arbitrary non-stationary observables. Furthermore, by analyzing the global geometry of this manifold, we derive a universal non-perturbative (nonlinear) response inequality in terms of geodesic length. This geometric framework reveals deep connections between dynamical activity, observable variance, and system sensitivity, and it encompasses or anticipates several recent results as special cases. Our approach offers new design principles for responsive behaviors in far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>Unified Linear Fluctuation-Response Theory Arbitrarily Far from Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds have recently been reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and recently developed non-equilibrium linear response relations. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from sampling unperturbed trajectories, offering significant advantages over traditional finite-difference approaches for estimating response properties of complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.</description>
