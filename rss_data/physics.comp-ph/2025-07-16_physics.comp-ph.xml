      <title>An improved argument principle root-search method for modes of slab waveguides, optical fibers, and spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update our root-search method for transcendental equations. Our method is globally convergent and is guaranteed to locate all complex roots within a specified search domain, since it is based on Cauchy's residue theorem. We extend the implementation to treat the dispersion relations of slab waveguides and the resonances of a sphere, in addition to step-index fibers. We also implement other improvements, such as to the contour selection procedure and using non-dimensional search variables, to ensure the method remains reliable even in challenging parameter regimes. We also extend the algorithm to identify leaky modes in terms of propagation constant eigenvalue modes, revealing, to the first time to our knowledge, a discontinuity across the light line in the dispersion plot.</description>

      <title>Fragment size density estimator for shrinkage-induced fracture based on a physics-informed neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Multimode Waveguides Based on Large Step Size AdaMax from Far-Field Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing multimode waveguide performance depends on modal analysis; however, current approaches focus predominantly on modal power distribution and, limited by experimental hardware and conditions, exhibit low accuracy, poor adaptability, and high computational cost. In this work, under a power-normalization constraint, we employ the AdaMax optimizer with a large-step-size strategy to perform modal analysis of multimode waveguides from far-field amplitude measurements. Our method retrieves both the modal power distribution and the modal relative-phase distribution, and we elucidate how twin-image ambiguity limits the capability to analyze modal relative-phase distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well for both rectangular and circular waveguides, maintaining high accuracy and robustness under noise with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 20 to 120 dB, and achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and computational cost over comparable methods. This method provides a novel solution for modal analysis with broad application potential.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Drift-Kinetic Particle Dynamics within General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations of Black Holes Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical plasmas in relativistic spacetimes, such as black hole accretion flows, are often weakly collisional and require kinetic modeling to capture non-local transport and particle acceleration. However, the extreme scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic processes limits the feasibility of fully kinetic simulations. A covariant guiding center formalism has recently been derived to address this challenge in curved spacetimes. We present a new hybrid numerical algorithm based on this formalism, which evolves the trajectories of charged particles over macroscopic timescales in GRMHD backgrounds. To address numerical instabilities in the equations of motion, we develop a semi-implicit integrator that ensures stable evolution in strong-field environments. We apply our method to GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency across a range of physical conditions.</description>

      <title>Norm-Stabilized Imaginary-Time Evolution via Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a norm-stabilized imaginary-time evolution (ITE) scheme for the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). Traditional ITE solvers often require explicit renormalization of the wavefunction after each step to preserve norm, which can be disruptive and algorithmically inflexible. We propose an alternative approach in which the evolution is continuously stabilized using an adaptive feedback term mu(tau), proportional to the time derivative of the wavefunction norm. This results in a self-regulating flow that requires no external normalization while preserving convergence toward soliton solutions. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness by comparing the final wavefunction profiles and L2 errors against analytical solutions and baseline methods without feedback. Although this work focuses on the 1D case, the framework is designed to extend naturally to higher dimensions. Future work will explore the behavior of the feedback mechanism in 2D and 3D systems, multi-soliton scenarios, and external potentials.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Quantum Circuit Design for the Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM. Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step, implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity, demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow recirculation.</description>

      <title>Gauss' Separation Algorithm for the Magnetic Field Decomposition of the SPARC PRD simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic separation algorithm originally introduced by Gauss has been revisited in recent years with application to magnetically-confined fusion experiments. The main result offered by Gauss' Separation Algorithm~(GSA) is a magnetic field computation that enables the decomposition of the contributions due to sources internal and external to a bounded volume through the generalized Virtual-Casing Principle. The present work applies GSA to simulations of the SPARC Primary Reference Discharge and demonstrates its separation capability on all phases of the shot, including the ramp-up during which significant currents on the passive structures often complicate the reconstruction of plasma equilibria. Such early results suggest a promising new way to study ramp-ups, disruptions, and vertical displacement events without any specific modeling assumption. Envisaged applications include reading magnetic data from experimental diagnostics and producing a new set of signals without external contributions to be used by downstream equilibrium codes for improved accuracy or speed.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Guided Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Descriptor Discovery in Perovskite Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As vast databases of chemical identities become increasingly available, the challenge shifts to how we effectively explore and leverage these resources to study molecular properties. This paper presents an active learning approach for molecular discovery using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), demonstrated on the QM9 dataset. DKL links structural embeddings directly to properties, creating organized latent spaces that prioritize relevant property information. By iteratively recalculating embedding vectors in alignment with target properties, DKL uncovers concentrated maxima representing key molecular properties and reveals unexplored regions with potential for innovation. This approach underscores DKL's potential in advancing molecular research and discovery.</description>

      <title>Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of topology by electric field in breathing kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome lattices have attracted much attention recently due to the interplay of band topology with magnetism and electronic correlations, which give rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. A common structural distortion of the kagome lattice is the breathing mode, which can significantly influence the magnetism and band characteristics. However, the modulation of breathing mode and the associated topological phenomena remain rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate that the coupling of breathing modes with ferroelectricity, magnetism, and band topology in the M3X8 monolayer system enables electric field manipulation of topological spin structure and electronic states. The breathing mode mainly occurs in materials containing early 4d/5d transition metal elements and can be reversed or even suppressed via ferroelectric switching in low-barrier materials. Importantly, electric field-induced switching of the breathing mode can alter the chirality of the topological spin structure, or trigger a transition from a topological trivial insulator to a Chern insulator. This work paves the way for exploring novel physical phenomena driven by breathing modes in kagome materials.</description>

Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>A linearly-implicit energy-momentum preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as geometrically nonlinear elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The integration strategy preserves energy and angular momentum exactly. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite deformations. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the leapfrog scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents generated via the nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) exhibit significant potential for spintronics applications, with both computational and experimental validations. Addressing the scarcity of conductive altermagnets, we propose strain engineering as a reliable method for inducing altermagnetism. Focusing on rutile-structured $\mathrm{OsO}_2$, first-principles calculations show that minor equibiaxial tensile strain ($\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$=3\%) induces nonmagnetic-to-altermagnetic transitions, achieving an ASSE-driven spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim$7\% -- far surpassing conventional spin Hall angles ($\theta_{\text{IS}}$). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to nonrelativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's nonrelativistic origin. Further investigation reveals that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>QMetric: Benchmarking Quantum Neural Networks Across Circuits, Features, and Training Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As hybrid quantum-classical models gain traction in machine learning, there is a growing need for tools that assess their effectiveness beyond raw accuracy. We present QMetric, a Python package offering a suite of interpretable metrics to evaluate quantum circuit expressibility, feature representations, and training dynamics. QMetric quantifies key aspects such as circuit fidelity, entanglement entropy, barren plateau risk, and training stability. The package integrates with Qiskit and PyTorch, and is demonstrated via a case study on binary MNIST classification comparing classical and quantum-enhanced models. Code, plots, and a reproducible environment are available on GitLab.</description>
