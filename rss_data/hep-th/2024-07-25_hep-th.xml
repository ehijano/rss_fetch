      <title>Gravitating Skyrmions with localized fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider self-gravitating Skyrmions in the presence of Dirac fermions, that carry spin and isospin. By varying the gravitational and the Yukawa coupling constants, we investigate the spectral flow of the fermion eigenvalue associated with a zero mode in the absence of gravity. We demonstrate that the backreaction of the fermion can strongly influence the Skyrmion-fermion configurations. In particular, the energy conditions may be violated, and regular anti-gravitating asymptotically flat solutions with negative ADM mass may emerge.</description>

      <title>Heterotic Strings and Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of the ten-dimensional heterotic string theories appropriate for implementing the stringy replica method for the calculation of quantum entanglement entropy. A novel feature for the heterotic string is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure modular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking. We show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically continued, with a finite answer in the domain $0&lt;N \leq 1$, relevant for calculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon. We discuss the physical implications of our results.</description>

      <title>God of the Gaps: Random matrix models and the black hole spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that random matrix models are a natural tool for understanding the appearance of a large gap in the microstate spectrum of black holes when there is a high degeneracy of states, in a variety of settings. While the most natural context is extended supersymmetry, where the number of BPS states scales as ${\rm e}^{S_0}$, where $S_0$ is the $T{=}0$ entropy, it is a robust feature that a large gap will appear whenever there is a mechanism producing a high degree of degeneracy. In random matrix model terms, the phenomenon is simply an extreme case of eigenvalue repulsion in the effective log gas description. We exhibit several examples for illustration, starting with the simple Wishart model, continuing with extensions of it that incorporate multicritical behaviour allowing for the emergence of gravity, and culminating in using such models to non-perturbatively construct ${N}{=}2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity theories, the latter of which is new.</description>

      <title>Differential equations and recursive solutions for cosmological amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently considerable efforts have been devoted to computing cosmological correlators and the corresponding wavefunction coefficients, as well as understanding their analytical structures. In this note, we revisit the computation of these ``cosmological amplitudes" associated with any tree or loop graph for conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in the power-law FRW universe, directly in terms of iterated time integrals. We start by decomposing any such cosmological amplitude (for loop graph, the ``integrand" prior to loop integrations) as a linear combination of {\it basic time integrals}, one for each {\it directed graph}. We derive remarkably simple first-order differential equations involving such time integrals with edges ``contracted" one at a time, which can be solved recursively and the solution takes the form of Euler-Mellin integrals/generalized hypergeometric functions. By combining such equations, we then derive a complete system of differential equations for all time integrals needed for a given graph. Our method works for any graph: for a tree graph with $n$ nodes, this system can be transformed into the {\it canonical differential equations} of size $4^{n{-}1}$ quivalent to the graphic rules derived recently%so-called ``kinematic flow", and we also derive the system of differential equations for loop integrands {\it e.g.} of all-loop two-site graphs and one-loop $n$-gon graphs. Finally, we show how the differential equations truncate for the de Sitter (dS) case (in a way similar to differential equations for Feynman integrals truncate for integer dimensions), which immediately yields the complete symbol for the dS amplitude with interesting structures {\it e.g.} for $n$-site chains and $n$-gon cases.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of massless fields and kinematic duality between interior null cones and null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between two branches of solutions (radiative and subradiative) of wave equations on Minkowski spacetime is investigated, for any integer spin, in flat Bondi coordinates where remarkable simplifications occur and allow for exact boundary-to-bulk formulae. Each branch carries a unitary irreducible representation of the Poincare group, though an exotic one for the subradiative sector. These two branches of solutions are related by an inversion and, together, span a single representation of the conformal group. While radiative modes are realised in the familiar holographic way (either as boundary data at null infinity or as bulk fields with radiative asymptotic behavior), the whole tower of subradiative modes forms an indecomposable representation of the usual Poincare group, which can be encoded into a single boundary field living on an interior null cone. Lorentz transformations are realised in both cases as conformal transformations of the celestial sphere. The vector space of all subradiative modes carries a unitary representation of a group isomorphic to the Poincare group, where bulk conformal boosts play the role of bulk translations.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Irreducible decompositions of tensors via the Brauer algebra and applications to metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this thesis, we make use of representation theory of groups and algebras to perform an irreducible decomposition of tensors in the context of metric-affine gravity. In particular, we consider the action of the orthogonal group O(1, d$-1$) on the Riemann tensor associated with an affine connection defined on a d-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This connection, with torsion and non-metricity, is the characteristic ingredient of metric-affine theories of gravity.
  In the second part of this thesis, we construct the projection operators used for the aforementioned decomposition. They are realized in terms of the symmetric group algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$ and of the Brauer algebra B$_n$(d) which are related respectively to the action of GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$)) and to the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form O(1 , d$-1$)) on tensors via the Schur-Weyl duality. First of all, we give an alternative approach to the known formulas for the central idempotents of $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$. These elements provide a unique reducible decomposition, known as the isotypic decomposition. For our purposes, this decomposition is remarkably handy to arrive at the sought after irreducible decomposition with respect to GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$). Then, we construct the elements in B$_n$(d) which realize the isotypic decomposition of a tensor under the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$). This decomposition is irreducible under O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) when applied to an irreducible GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) tensor of order $5$ or less. As a by product of the construction, we give a solution to the problem of decomposing an arbitrary tensor into its traceless part, doubly traceless part and so on. These results led to the development of several Mathematica packages linked to the \textit{xAct} bundle for tensor calculus in field theory.</description>

      <title>Superconformal anomalies for string defects in six-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anomalies of two-dimensional BPS defects in six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories. Using a holographic description of these defects furnished by probe D4-branes in AdS${}_7$ solutions of ten-dimensional type IIA supergravity, we compute the two independent defect Weyl from the on-shell action for a spherical defect and defect sphere entanglement entropy. We find agreement between the holographic prediction for the defect A-type anomaly coming from the defect sphere free energy and the leading large $N$ contribution to the defect `t Hooft anomaly found using anomaly inflow. We also find agreement between the holographic computation of the expectation value of a surface operator wrapping a torus and the supersymmetric localization computation for a circular Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory on $S^5$. Lastly, we holographically compute the defect gravitational anomaly from the Wess-Zumino action of the probe D4-brane, which provides a subleading large $N$ correction to the defect A-type anomaly.</description>

      <title>Deriving Weyl double copies with sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy is a relationship between classical solutions in gauge and gravity theories, and has previously been applied to vacuum solutions in both General Relativity and its generalisations. There have also been suggestions that the Weyl double copy should extend to solutions with non-trivial sources. In this paper, we provide a systematic derivation of sourced Weyl double copy formulae, using spinorial methods previously established for ${\cal N}=0$ supergravity. As a cross-check, we rederive the same formulae using a tensorial approach, which then allows us to extend our arguments to sources containing arbitrary powers of the inverse radial coordinate. We also generalise our results to include the Kerr-Newman black hole, clarifying previous alternative double copy formulae presented in the literature. Our results extend the validity of the Weyl double copy, and may be useful for further astrophysical applications of this correspondence.</description>

      <title>What is the Curvature of 2D Euclidean Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies, leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution exhibits regularity, free from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions to obtain a Weyl gauge invariant theory. For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is `pure gauge', the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields are of geometric origin, with no added matter or compensating Weyl scalars, etc. The calculation is done in a Weyl {\it gauge covariant} and {\it metric} formulation of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string via $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string theory to the most general case, including its T-dual solutions. It is well-known that the large $D$ limit of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in gravity becomes a two-dimensional near-horizon geometry. Similarly, the large $D$ limit of its T-dual solution, obtained by the Buscher rules, namely the string black hole with a naked singularity, reduces to a two-dimensional near-singularity geometry. Both of these geometries are described by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory and are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate that these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional Hohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of non-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach action provides a systematic way to investigate the $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected near-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which are difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.</description>

      <title>Third-order Pertubative OTOC of Harmonic Oscillator with Quartic Interaction and Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the third order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with extra quartic interaction by the second quantization method. We obtain the analytic relations of spectrum, Fock space states and matrix elements of coordinate which are then used to numerically calculate the OTOC. We see that OTOC saturates to a constant value at later times, i.e. $C_T(\infty)\to 2\langle x^2\rangle_T\langle p^2\rangle_T$, which associates with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze early-time property of $C_T$ and see that the exponential growth, which diagnoses the chaos, is shown in the third-order perturbation.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and first-order QCD transition with gravitational waves from a large lepton asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large primordial lepton asymmetry can lead to successful baryogenesis by preventing the restoration of electroweak symmetry at high temperatures, thereby suppressing the sphaleron rate. This asymmetry can also lead to a first-order cosmic QCD transition, accompanied by detectable gravitational wave (GW) signals. By employing next-to-leading order dimensional reduction we determine that the necessary lepton asymmetry is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Incorporating an updated QCD equation of state that harmonizes lattice and functional QCD outcomes, we pinpoint the range of lepton flavor asymmetries capable of inducing a first-order cosmic QCD transition. To maintain consistency with observational constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, achieving the correct baryon asymmetry requires entropy dilution by approximately a factor of ten. However, the first-order QCD transition itself can occur independently of entropy dilution. We propose that the sphaleron freeze-in mechanism can be investigated through forthcoming GW experiments such as $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>A QCD R-Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: R-parity can be extended to a continuous global U(1)${}_R$ symmetry. We investigate whether an anomalous U(1)${}_R$ can be identified as the PQ symmetry suitable for solving the strong CP problem within supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. In this case, U(1)${}_R$ is broken at some intermediate scale and the QCD axion is the R-axion. Moreover, the R-symmetry can be naturally gauged via the Green-Schwartz mechanism within completions to supergravity, thus evading the axion quality problem. Obstacles to realizing this scenario are highlighted and phenomenologically viable approaches are identified.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation or the modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at finite masses, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing'' and "no boundary'' proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <title>Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We additionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii can reach at these mass scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework combining the higher-twist formalism of exclusive processes in the $s$ channel with the semi-classical effective description of small-$x$ physics in the $t$ channel. We apply it to transversely polarized light vector meson production, $\gamma^{*} p \rightarrow V (\rho, \varphi ,\omega) \; p$, which starts at the next-to-leading power and for which a purely collinear treatment leads to end-point singularities. The result is obtained in the most general kinematics, including both forward and non-forward cases by preserving the full impact parameter dependence in the non-perturbative correlators, in both momentum and coordinate space representations. A systematic expansion of the Wilson lines in terms of Reggeized gluon fields is performed in order to obtain the results in the weak-field BFKL approximation. These new results will allow for investigating the dilute-to-dense regime transition of QCD for a wide class of observables.</description>

Abstract: We stratify families of projective and very affine hypersurfaces according to their topological Euler characteristic. Our new algorithms compute all strata using algebro-geometric techniques. For very affine hypersurfaces, we investigate and exploit the relation to critical point computations. Euler stratifications are relevant in particle physics and algebraic statistics. They fully describe the dependence of the number of master integrals, respectively the maximum likelihood degree, on kinematic or model parameters.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution and thermality via path integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM is the generator of the time evolution of a diamond observer, and its dynamical behavior leads to the predicted thermal nature. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</description>

Abstract: Exclusive diffractive meson production represents a golden channel for investigating gluonic saturation inside nucleons and nuclei. In this letter, we settle a systematic framework to deal with beyond leading power corrections at small-$x$, including the saturation regime, and obtain the $\gamma^{*} \rightarrow M (\rho, \phi, \omega)$ impact factor with both incoming photon and outgoing meson carrying arbitrary polarizations. This is of particular interest since the saturation scale at modern colliders, although entering a perturbative regime, is not large enough to prevents higher-twist effects to be sizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GW due to the density function in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We couple to group field theory (GFT) a scalar field that encodes the entanglement between manifold sites. The scalar field provides a relational clock that enables the derivation of the Hamiltonian of the system from the GFT action. Inspecting the Hamiltonian, we show that a theory of emergent gravity arises, and that this can be recast according to the Ashtekar's formulation of general relativity. The evolution of the GFT observables is regulated by the Shroedinger equation generated by the Hamiltonian. This is achieved by imposing a renormalization group (RG) flow that corresponds to a simplified Ricci flow. As a consequence of the quantization procedure, the Hamiltonian is recovered to be non-Hermitian, and can be related to the complex action formalism, in which the initial conditions and the related future evolution of the systems are dictated by the imaginary part of the action.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate possible actions for antisymmetric two-tensor field models subject to constraints that force the field to acquire a nonzero vacuum expectation value, thereby spontaneously breaking Lorentz invariance. In order to assure stability, we require that the associate Hamiltonian be bounded from below. It is shown that this requirement rules out any quadratic action constructed only from the antisymmetric tensor field. We then explicitly construct a hybrid model consisting of the antisymmetric two-tensor field together with a vector field, subject to constraints forcing nonzero expectation values, that is stable in Minkowski space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principle of maximum ignorance posits that the coarse-grained description of a system is maximally agnostic about its underlying microscopic structure. We briefly review this principle for random matrix theory and for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We then apply this principle in holography to construct ensembles of random mixed states. This leads to an ensemble of microstates which models our microscopic ignorance, and which on average reproduces the effective semiclassical physics of a given bulk state. We call this ensemble the state-averaging ansatz. The output of our model is a prediction for semiclassical contributions to variances and higher statistical moments over the ensemble of microstates. The statistical moments provide coarse-grained -- yet gravitationally non-perturbative -- information about the microstructure of the individual states of the ensemble. We show that these contributions exactly match the on-shell action of known wormhole configurations of the gravitational path integral. These results strengthen the view that wormholes simply parametrize the ignorance of the microstructure of a fundamental state, given a fixed semiclassical bulk description.</description>

Abstract: Higher dimensional Euclidean Liouville conformal field theories (LCFTs) consist of a log-correlated real scalar field with a background charge and an exponential potential. We analyse the LCFT on a four-dimensional manifold with a boundary. We extend to the boundary, the conformally covariant GJMS operator and the ${\cal Q}$-curvature term in the LCFT action and classify the conformal boundary conditions. Working on a flat space with plate boundary, we calculate the dimensions of the boundary conformal primary operators, the two- and three-point functions of the displacement operator and the boundary conformal anomaly coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way, all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further: they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.</description>

      <title>Multivalued (Wess-Zumino-Novikov) Functional in Fluid Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce hydrodynamics derived from the action of a perfect fluid deformed by the Wess-Zumono-Novikov multivalued functional generated by combined actions of gauge transformations and spacetime diffeomorphisms. The deformation is structured analogously to the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly used as an effective description of field theories with the chiral anomaly and produces consistent fluid equations which are covariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms and Onsager semiclassical quantization. The deformation affects the continuity equation giving fluid spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

Abstract: We show that the hydrodynamic of the perfect fluid admits a deformation that includes a chiral gravitational (or mixed) anomaly alongside the chiral current anomaly. The deformation introduces the gravitational Chern-Simons term and an analog of an axion in fluid mechanics, and features fluid spin-current and anomaly induced spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a covariant method of constructing entire trajectories of physical states in superstring theory in the critical dimension. It is inspired by a recently developed covariant technology of excavating bosonic string trajectories, that is facilitated by the observation that the Virasoro constraints can be written as linear combinations of lowering operators of a bigger algebra, namely a symplectic algebra, which is Howe dual to the spacetime Lorentz algebra. For superstrings, it is the orthosymplectic algebra that appears instead, with its lowest weight states forming the simplest class of physical trajectories in the NS sector. To construct the simplest class in the R sector, the lowest weight states need to be supplemented with other states, which we determine. Deeper trajectories are then constructed by acting with suitable combinations of the raising operators of the orthosymplectic algebra, which we illustrate with several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors interacting with a relativistic scalar quantum field is presented. After tracing out the field modes, the resulting density matrix for a bipartite qutrit system is employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Unlike the case of spin $1/2$, for which the effects of the quantum field result in a decreasing of the size of violation, in the case of spin $1$ both decreasing and increasing of the violation may occur. This effect is ascribed to the fact that Tsirelson's bound is not saturated in the case of qutrits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of D-instantons on closed string scattering amplitudes may be encoded into an effective action obtained by integrating out the (transient) open string fields. In order that this respects the gauge invariance of the theory, the sum of the perturbative closed string field theory action and the D-instanton induced effective action must satisfy the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation. In a previous paper this was proved for the effective action induced by up to two instantons. We generalize the proof for arbitrary number of D-instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct charged AdS black holes with a global monopole charge in diverse dimensions and study the thermodynamics. We find a critical monopole charge below which the solution exhibits Van-der Waals like behaviors. In the context of holography, this could be intepreted using the boundary degrees of freedoms. As an example, we study the phase diagram in the four dimensions analytically. We further analyze the microstructures of the solution using Ruppeiner geometry. We find that repulsive interactions dominates for black holes in a wide range of temperatures. However, around the critical point, attractive interactions is dominant and the Ruppeiner scalar curvature shows universal behaviors: it has a critical exponent $2$ and coefficient $-1/8$ in diverse dimensions. Universality of the results is interpreted from the scaling behavior of free energy near the critical point for Van-der Waals like fluids.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic tachyons: a new representation of the Galilei group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algebraic characterization of the contractions of the Poincar\'e group permits a proper construction of a non-relativistic limit of its tachyonic representation. We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the Galilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical properties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the relativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better comprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance, we see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as for relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same for all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean system. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation cannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.</description>

Abstract: We argued in the paper "Geometry from Donaldson-Thomas invariants" that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should define a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions. In this paper we show how to associate a generating function to these geometric structures which we call the tau function. In the case of the derived category of the resolved conifold, this function reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function introduced in the paper "Riemann-Hilbert problems for the resolved conifold". In the case of the A2 quiver it is the Painleve I tau function. The definition of the tau-function depends on certain choices of additional data which we discuss in the paper. There is still much to understand!</description>

Abstract: It has been established that the famous three-dimensional Thurston geometries have four intrinsically Lorentzian analogs. We explore these spacetimes in three-dimensional general relativity nonminimally coupled to a scalar field together with electromagnetic matter. We find that three of these spacetimes support electromagnetic radiation, while, the other is partially sourced by a nonnull field and supports gravitational radiation. By addressing this problem we have also found a novel type of gravitational Cheshire effect.</description>

      <title>Impact of (magneto-)thermoelectric effect on diffusion of conserved charges in hot and dense hadronic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric effect, which describes the generation of an electric field induced by temperature and conserved charge chemical potential gradients, in the hot and dense hadronic matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Utilizing the Boltzmann kinetic theory within the repulsive mean-field hadron resonance gas model, we evaluate both the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon number ($B$), electric charge ($Q$), and strangeness ($S$). The Landau-Lifshitz choice for the rest frame of the fluid is enforced in the derivation. We find that the thermoelectric effect hinders the diffusion processes of multiple conserved charges, particularly reducing the coupling between electric charge and baryon number (strangeness) in baryon (strangeness) diffusion. Given that the repulsive mean-field interactions between hadrons have a significant effect on the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix in the baryon-rich region, we extend the investigation to include the impact of magnetic fields, analyzing the magneto-thermoelectric effect on both the diffusion coefficient matrix and the Hall-like diffusion coefficient matrix. The sensitivities of the magnetic field-dependent diffusion thermopower matrix and magneto-thermoelectric modified diffusion coefficient matrix to the choices of various transverse conditions are also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility that quantum geometry effects may alleviate the apparent tensions existing at large angular scales in the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background explains the increasing interest in considering primordial perturbations within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. In this framework, a number of approximations have been suggested to simplify the study of perturbations and derive analytic expressions for the power spectra. This study requires a new choice of vacuum state that takes into account the preinflationary background geometry, choice for which we adopt the so-called NO-AHD prescription. Here, we apply the aforementioned approximations to the investigation of scalar perturbations. We discuss two approaches to the quantization of perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology, namely the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches. We improve previous approximations by including slow-roll corrections in the inflationary era. Moreover, for the first time in the literature of the NO-AHD prescription, we compute numerically the primordial power spectra for the two considered approaches, and show that the analytic estimations are remarkably accurate for all observable modes. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the spectra obtained with those two approaches.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT correspondence, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples (even including some simple sources) for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity is highly successful in explaining a wide range of gravitational phenomena including the gravitational waves emitted by binary systems and the shadows cast by supermassive black holes. From a modern perspective the theory is not fundamental though, but constitutes the lowest order term in an effective field theory description of the gravitational force. As a consequence, the gravitational dynamics should receive corrections by higher-derivative terms. This essay discusses structural aspects associated with these corrections and summarizes their imprint on static, spherically symmetric geometries. Along these lines, we critically reassess the common practice of using local field redefinitions in order to simplify the dynamics at the danger of shifting physics effects into sectors which are beyond the approximation under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choptuik's critical phenomena in general relativity is revisited in the affine-null metric formulation of Einstein's equations for a massless scalar field in spherical symmetry. Numerical solutions are obtained by evolution of initial data using pseudo-spectral methods. The underlying system consists of differential equations along the outgoing null rays which can be solved in sequential form. A new two-parameter family of initial data is presented for which these equations can be integrated analytically. Specific choices of the initial data parameters correspond to either an asymptotically flat null cone, a black hole event horizon or the singular interior of a black hole. Our main focus is on the interior features of a black hole, for which the affine-null system is especially well adapted. We present both analytic and numerical results describing the geometric properties of the apparent horizon and final singularity. Using a re-gridding technique for the affine parameter, numerical evolution of initially asymptotically flat supercritical data can be continued inside the event horizon and track the apparent horizon up to the formation of the final singularity.</description>

      <title>Violation of $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brans Class I solution in Brans-Dicke gravity is a staple in the study of gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. Discovered in 1961, it describes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is characterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship between these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously established. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\textit{the}$ complete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total energy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution allows for the $\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source. Particularly for the $\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result $\gamma_{\,\text{PPN}}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\Theta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\Theta}$ where $\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_{\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\gamma$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. Consequently, observational constraints on $\gamma$ thus set $\textit{joint}$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of the mass source. More broadly, our formula highlights the importance of pressure (when $\varTheta\neq0$) in spherical Brans-Dicke stars, and potentially in stars within other modified theories of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor-to-scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from inflation/bouncing Universe in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the non-linear interactions within the VCDM model, a type II minimally modified gravity model with the same number of degrees of freedom as in General Relativity but not connected to the latter by field redefinitions. During an inflationary phase in the early universe, if the VCDM potential does not modify the slow-roll behavior of the inflaton field, we recover, up to the leading order, the standard results for the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, if the VCDM potential becomes dominant, the interactions can strongly deviate and even violate the Maldacena's consistency relation for the local non-Gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently introduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects current observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of the local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

      <title>Geometric additivity of modular commutator for multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent surge of research in many-body quantum entanglement has uncovered intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems. A prime example is the modular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single wave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body entanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum many-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator, indicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer multiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we also derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving disconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We further illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems using numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\pi$-flux models.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Yang-Mills Beyond One-Loop Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for \(SU(N)\) Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims that first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, paving the way for IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

      <title>The scalar-torsion gravity corrections in the first-order inflationary models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the corrections to the cosmological models based on the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity induced by the non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion. To determine these corrections, we consider a power-law parametrization of the deviations between the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and the scalar-torsion gravity. The estimates of the possible influence of the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and torsion on the background cosmological parameters and the parameters of cosmological perturbations for the inflationary models implying linear relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of the scalar perturbations are obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models based on observational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters is also considered.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the quantum phase transitions of metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a distortion or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>
