      <title>Non-Hermitian free-fermion critical systems and logarithmic conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal invariance often accompanies criticality in Hermitian systems. However, its fate in non-Hermitian settings is less clear, especially near exceptional points where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. Here we investigate whether a 1+1-dimensional gapless non-Hermitian system can admit a conformal description, focusing on a PT-symmetric free-fermion field theory. Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters. We further present a microscopic construction and show how the same conformal data (with finite-size corrections) can be extracted from the lattice model at exceptional-point criticality, thereby supporting the field-theory prediction.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Thermodynamic Limit with Neural-Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Simulations of Strongly Coupled Spin Ensembles for Inferring Nature of Electronic Correlations from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient package for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin echo experiments to study the effects of strong electronic spin correlations on the dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble. A mean-field model is used to study correlated electronic phases through their hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. We explore the dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble and discuss the key behaviors of the system. In particular, we classify the types of temporal asymmetry that the interaction induces in the system as well as a pulse-dependent shift in the spectral domain. Us- ing these results, we discuss how careful measurement of the pulse-dependent shiftcanbeusedtoextractinformationabouttheanisotropyoftheelectronic interaction and how these results represent a novel tool for the examination of exotic NMR signatures in strongly correlated materials. Finally, we re- view specific aspects of the simulation package developed for our exploration and give explicit examples where package can be used to infer range and anisotropy of electronic correlations. In particular, we discuss its structure, accuracy, and the technical merits of the various approximations used to model the nuclear spin ensemble.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Effective Hamiltonian Approach to Second-Harmonic Generation in Quantum Magnets: Application to NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although second harmonic generation (SHG) is a promising and widely used method recently for studying 2D magnetic materials, the quantitative analysis of the full SHG tensor is currently challenging. In this letter, we describe a first-principles-based approach towards quantitative analysis of SHG in insulating magnets through formulation in terms of dynamical effective operators. These operators are computed by solving local many-body cluster models. We benchmark this method on NiI$_2$, a multiferroic 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet, demonstrating quantitative analysis of reported Rotational Anisotropy (RA)-SHG data. SHG is demonstrated to probe local ring-current susceptibilities, which provide sensitivity to short-range chiral spin-spin correlations. The described methods may be easily extended to other non-linear optical responses and materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetic field on whirling-anti-whirling order in icosahedral-quasicrystal approximant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent neutron measurement in the icosahedral quasicrystal approximant Au-SM-Tb (SM=Al, Ga) has revealed unique noncollinear magnetic order ``whirling-anti-whirling states''. Here, we report theoretical analysis on the magnetic-field-direction dependence on the whirling-anti-whirling order in the 1/1 approximant crystal. By performing exact-diagonalization calculation for the effective model taking into account the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy arising from the crystalline electric field, we show the metamagnetic transition takes place simultaneously with the topological transition under the magnetic field along the (111) direction. After the metamagnetic transition, the emergent fictious magnetic field induced by the chirality of noncoplanar magnetic moments appears, the analysis of which concludes that the topological Hall effect is expected to be observed in the electrical conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{yz}$ for the applied field direction from (111) to (001).</description>

      <title>Single crystal growth and properties of Au- and Ge-substituted EuPd$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the single crystal growth of Eu(Pd$_{1-x}$Au$_x$)$_2$Si$_2$, $0&lt; x\leq 0.2$, from a levitating Eu-rich melt using the Czochralski method. Our structural analysis of the samples confirms the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure as well as an increase of the room temperature $a$ and $c$ lattice parameters with increasing $x$. Chemical analysis reveals that, depending on the Au concentration, only about 25-35\% of the amount of Au available in the initial melt is incorporated into the crystal structure, resulting in a decreasing substitution level for increasing $x$. Through Au substitution, chemical pressure is applied and large changes in valence crossover temperatures are already observed for low substitution levels $x$. In contrast to previous studies, we do not find any signs of a first-order transition in samples with $x_{\rm nom}=0.1$ or AFM order for higher $x$. Furthermore, we observe the formation of quarternary side phases for a higher amount of Au in the melt.
  In addition, cubic-mm-sized single crystals of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ with $x_{\rm nom}=0.2$ were grown. The analysis of the X-ray fluorescence revealed that the crystals exhibit a slight variation in the Ge content. Such tiny compositional changes can cause changes in the sample properties concerning variations of the crossover temperature or changes of the type of the transition from crossover to magnetic order. Furthermore, we report on a new orthorhombic phase EuPd$_{1.42}$Si$_{1.27}$Ge$_{0.31}$ that orders antiferromagnetically below $17\,\rm K$.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity in noncollinear magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic memory and logic devices, including prospective ones based on skyrmions, inevitably produce heat. Thus, controlling heat flow is essential for their performance. Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments. The results provide the blueprint for calculating magnetic thermal transport in non-collinear magnets.</description>

      <title>Calculating Feynman diagrams with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text reviews, hopefully in a pedagogical manner, a series of work on the automatic calculations of Feynman diagrams in the context of quantum nanoelectronics (Keldysh formalism) with an application to the Kondo effect in the out-of-equilibrium single impurity Anderson model. It includes a discussion of (A) how to deal with the proliferation of diagrams, (B) how to calculate them using the Tensor Cross Interpolation algorithm instead of Monte-Carlo and (C) how to resum the obtained series. These notes correspond to a lecture given at the Autumn School on Correlated Electrons 2025 in Jullich, Germany. The book with all the lectures of the school (edited by Eva Pavarini, Erik Koch, Alexander Lichtenstein, and Dieter Vollhardt) is available in open access.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Many-Body States in NiPS$_3$ Revealed by Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\mu$-ARPES spectra of the Mott-insulating van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the N\'eel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory. Our results confirm that NiPS$_3$ is an excellent model platform in which strong correlations, reduced dimensionality, and covalent metal-ligand bonding jointly shape both two- and single-particle spectroscopies, underscoring the need for a genuinely quantum many-body description of two-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Resolving Quantum Criticality in the Honeycomb Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between Dirac fermions and electronic correlations on the honeycomb lattice hosts a fundamental quantum phase transition from a semimetal to a Mott insulator, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH) universality class. Despite its importance, consensus on the precise critical exponents remains elusive due to severe finite-size effects in numerical simulations and the lack of conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective Mottness Driven by Geometric Frustration of Interorbital Hybridization in Pr4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among orbital-selective Mott physics, Hund's coupling, tunable structural motifs, and Kondo-like scattering establishes a compelling paradigm for understanding and engineering correlated multi-orbital systems, as vividly exemplified by nickelate superconductors. Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Modeling of Charge-Density-Wave Recovery After Laser Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-pumped two-dimensional spinless Holstein model within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the melting and recovery of long-range charge-density-wave order. Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: We present a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for solving the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM) arising in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals.</description>

      <title>A Unified Categorical Description of Quantum Hall Hierarchy and Anyon Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified category-theoretic framework for quantum Hall hierarchy constructions and anyon superconductivity based on modular tensor categories over $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{U}(1))$ and $\mathrm{sRep}(\mathrm{U}(1)^f)$. Our approach explicitly incorporates conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and formulates doping via a generalized stack-and-condense procedure, in which an auxiliary topological order is stacked onto the parent phase, and the quasiparticles created by doping subsequently condense. Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra. Our framework reproduces all known anyon superconductors obtained from field-theoretic analyses and further predicts novel phases, including a charge-$2e$ anyon superconductor derived from the Laughlin state and charge-$ke$ anyon superconductors arising from bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_k$ Read-Rezayi states. By placing hierarchy transitions and anyon superconductivity within a single mathematical formalism, our work provides a unified understanding of competing and proximate phases near experimentally realizable fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag in electron-hole bilayers: coherent exciton superflow as a diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing an exciton condensate from an excitonic gas or insulator remains a fundamental challenge, as both phases feature bound electron-hole pairs but differ only by the emergence of macroscopic phase coherence. Here, we theoretically propose that a spin-orbit-coupled bilayer system can host a finite-momentum exciton condensate exhibiting a nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag -- the coherent-exciton diode effect. This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality at strong randomness: a lesson from anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality in the presence of strong quenched randomness remains a challenging topic in modern condensed matter theory. We show that the topology and anomaly associated with average symmetry can be used to predict certain nontrivial universal properties. Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\overline{|\langle O_e(x)O^{\dagger}_e(y)\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\overline{\langle O_a(x)O^{\dagger}_a(y)\rangle}$ decays slowly. We verify these predictions in a few examples: the random-singlet Heisenberg spin chain in one dimension, and the disordered free-fermion critical states in symmetry class BDI in one and two dimensions. Surprisingly, even for these well-studied systems, our anomaly-based argument reveals critical correlations overlooked in previous literature. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of measuring these critical correlations.</description>

      <title>Straintronics and twistronics in bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of twist and strain in bilayer graphene enables the formation of moir\'e patterns and narrow bands that host correlated and topological phases. While magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has been widely studied, strain provides an additional and realistic control knob for band engineering. In this work, we first generate a global method to construct commensurate supercells for arbitrary twist and strain. Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Revealing Short- and Long-range Li-ion diffusion in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ from finite-temperature dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Li$_2$MnO$_3$ remains a crucial component of the Li-excess layered cathode family, $(1-x)\,\mathrm{LiMO_2} + x\,\mathrm{Li_2MnO_3}$ ($M$ = Mn, Ni, Co, \dots), but its role in limiting Li-ion mobility remains under debate. Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $\mu^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Numerical Studies of Barren Plateau and Overparametrization in Variational Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a parametrized quantum circuit is widely applicable to near-term quantum computing, but its fundamental issues that limit optimization performance have been reported in the literature. For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical understanding of the BP and OP phenomena has advanced over the past years, however, comprehensive studies of both effects in the same setting are not fully covered in the literature. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study in VQA, quantitatively evaluating the impacts of BP and OP and their interplay on the optimization of a variational quantum circuit, using concrete implementations of one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal field quantum Ising model. The numerical results are compared with the theoretical diagnostics of BP and OP phenomena. The framework presented in this paper will provide a guiding principle for designing VQA algorithms and ansatzes with theoretical support for behaviors of parameter optimization in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Emergent 3D Fermiology and Magnetism in an Intercalated Van der Waals System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation of magnetic atoms into van der Waals materials provides a versatile platform for tailoring unconventional magnetic properties. However, its impact on electronic dimensionality and exchange mechanisms remains poorly understood. Using Fe-intercalated TaS$_2$ as a model system, we combine X-ray absorption and resonant inelastic scattering with angle-resolved photoemission and first-principles calculations to reveal that intercalation reshapes the host electronic structure. We identify a spin-polarized intercalant-host hybridized band with pronounced out-of-plane dispersion crossing the Fermi level, providing an itinerant channel for interlayer magnetic exchange. This mechanism explains the breakdown of a purely atomic picture and establishes a direct link between lattice geometry, electronic dispersion, and magnetic order. Our findings demonstrate that intercalant-induced itinerancy enables tunable interlayer coupling in otherwise layered magnets, offering a general microscopic framework for engineering magnetic dimensionality in a broad class of intercalated vdW materials.</description>

      <title>Role of magnon-magnon interaction in optical excitation of coherent two-magnon modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-magnon modes are terahertz-frequency magnetic excitations in antiferromagnets, governed by exchange interactions and involving magnons from the entire Brillouin zone. The ability to couple to light promotes two-magnon modes as contenders for ultrafast optical manipulation of the magnetic state, beyond conventional zone-center magnonics. While magnon-magnon interactions are known to critically shape the two-magnon line in spontaneous Raman scattering spectra, their role in coherent time-domain excitations remains unexplored. We report a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the influence of magnon-magnon interactions on coherent two-magnon modes in a cubic antiferromagnet excited via Impulsive Stimulated Raman scattering. We reveal the nontrivial evolution of coherent magnetic dynamics in the time domain and the corresponding spectrum and compare it with the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum. By extending the spin-correlations based theory for two-magnon modes, we derive a unified description of their spectra in Raman Scattering and Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering and highlight the role of magnon-magnon interactions.</description>

Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</description>

Abstract: CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ stands out as the first stoichiometric metallic compound with a ferromagnetic quantum critical point, thereby garnering significant attention. Ferromagnetic Kondo lattice compounds ReRh$_6$Ge$_4$ (Re=Ce, Ho, Er, Tm) have been systematically investigated with density functional theory incorporating Coulomb interaction U and spin-orbital coupling. We determined the magnetic easy axis of CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is within the ab plane, which is in agreement with previous magnetization measurements conducted under external magnetic field and muSR experiments. We also predicted the magnetic easy axes for the other three compounds. For TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, the magnetic easy axis aligns along the c axis, thus preserving the $C_3$ rotational symmetry of the c axis. Especially, there are triply degenerate nodal points along the $\Gamma-A$ direction in the band structure including spin-orbital coupling. A possible localized to itinerant crossover is revealed as $4f$ electrons increase from CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ to TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$. Specifically, the $4f$ electrons of TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$ contribute to the formation of a large Fermi surface, indicating their participation in the conduction process. Conversely, the $4f$ electrons in HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$, ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ remain localized, which result in smaller Fermi surfaces for these compounds. These theoretical investigations on electronic structure and magnetic properties shed deep insight into the unique nature of $4f$ electrons, providing critical predictions for subsequent experimental studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example. Defining polarization for them is complicated because they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center, obtained from the Zak phase, is no longer gauge invariant. In this article, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations. Our expression can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. It is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.</description>

      <title>Gauging Modulated Symmetries via Multiple Gauge Symmetry Operators and Adaptive Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extended framework for the simultaneous gauging of modulated symmetries in $(d+1)$ dimensions, employing {\it multiple} gauge symmetry operators whose corresponding gauging procedures must be carried out simultaneously. Simultaneous gauging can capture a broader class of dualities than sequential gauging, the latter corresponding to the conventional gauging applied in successive steps. In general, performing simultaneous gauging and conventional gauging in sequence constitutes the most general framework for gauging modulated symmetries. We further show that the associated duality transformations can be implemented via adaptive state preparation protocols. As a concrete example, we consider a dipole symmetry in $(2+1)$D and illustrate both the simultaneous gauging procedure and the adaptive preparation protocol. Interestingly, we find that the intermediate state of the simultaneous gauging/adaptive circuit corresponds to a symmetry-protected topological phase protected by the dipole bundle symmetry. Finally, we utilize the duality to analyze the phase diagram of the rank-2 toric code under transverse fields.</description>

Abstract: One route to the control of quantum magnetism at ultrafast timescales is magnetophononics, the modulation of magnetic interactions by coherently driven lattice excitations. Theoretical studies of a gapped quantum magnet subject to continuous, single-frequency driving of one strongly coupled phonon mode find intriguing phenomena including mutually repelling phonon-bitriplon excitations and global renormalization of the spin excitation spectrum. Because experiments are performed with ultrashort pulses that contain a wide range of driving frequencies, we investigate phonon-bitriplon physics under pulsed laser driving. We use the equations of motion to compute the transient response of the driven and dissipative spin-phonon system, which we characterize using the phonon displacement, phonon number, and triplon occupations. In the Fourier transforms of each quantity we discover a low-frequency energetic oscillation between the lattice and spin sectors, which is an intrinsically nonequilibrium collective mode, and demonstrate its origin as a beating between mutually repelling composite excitations. We introduce a phonon-bitriplon approximation that captures all the physics of hybridization, collective mode formation, and difference-frequency excitation, and show that sum-frequency phenomena also leave clear signatures in the repsonse. We model the appearance of such magnetophononic phenomena in the strongly-coupled spin-chain compound CuGeO$_3$, whose overlapping phonon and spin excitation spectra are well characterized, to deduce the criteria for their possible observation in quantum magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Unified description of cuprate superconductors by fractionalized electrons emerging from integrated analyses of photoemission spectra and quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60 % higher than the initial value, then decays into a long-lived excited state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of electron correlations. Our findings open a new avenue for ultrafast optical control of nonlinear properties in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description>

      <title>Invertible phases for mixed spatial symmetries and the fermionic crystalline equivalence principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.02941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freed-Hopkins give a mathematical ansatz for classifying gapped invertible phases of matter with a spatial symmetry in terms of Borel-equivariant generalized homology. We propose a slight generalization of this ansatz to account for cases where the symmetry type mixes nontrivially with the spatial symmetry, such as crystalline phases with spin-1/2 fermions. From this ansatz, we prove as a theorem a "fermionic crystalline equivalence principle," as predicted in the physics literature. Using this and the Adams spectral sequence, we compute classifications of some classes of phases with a point group symmetry; in cases where these phases have been studied by other methods, our results agree with the literature.</description>

      <title>Role of scaling dimensions in generalized noises in fractional quantum Hall tunneling due to a temperature bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continued improvement of heat control in mesoscopic conductors brings novel tools for probing strongly correlated electron phenomena. Motivated by these advances, we comprehensively study transport due to a temperature bias in a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the charge-current noise (so-called delta-$T$ noise), heat-current noise, and mixed noise and elucidate how these observables can be used to infer strongly correlated properties of the device. Our main focus is the extraction of so-called scaling dimensions of the tunneling anyonic quasiparticles, of critical importance to correctly infer their anyonic exchange statistics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Supersymmetric SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation, which completely lifts the energy degeneracy, generates a stronger enhancement. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth, across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.</description>
