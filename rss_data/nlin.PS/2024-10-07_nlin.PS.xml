      <title>Exploring the role of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the chaotic dynamics of a large one-dimensional lattice of coupled maps with diffusive coupling of varying strength using the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs). Using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps we quantify the growth of spatial structures in the chaotic dynamics as the strength of diffusion is increased. When the diffusion strength is increased from zero, we find that the leading Lyapunov exponent decreases rapidly from a positive value to zero to yield a small window of periodic dynamics which is then followed by chaotic dynamics. For values of the diffusion strength beyond the window of periodic dynamics, the leading Lyapunov exponent does not vary significantly with the strength of diffusion with the exception of a small variation for the largest diffusion strengths we explore. The Lyapunov spectrum and fractal dimension are described analytically as a function of the diffusion strength using the eigenvalues of the coupling operator. The spatial features of the CLVs are quantified and compared with the eigenvectors of the coupling operator. The chaotic dynamics are composed entirely of physical modes for all of the conditions we explore. The leading CLV is highly localized and the localization decreases with increasing strength of the spatial coupling. The violation of the dominance of Oseledets splitting indicates that the entanglement of pairs of CLVs becomes more significant between neighboring CLVs as the strength of the diffusion is increased.</description>

      <title>Traveling vegetation-herbivore waves can sustain ecosystems threatened by droughts and population growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dryland vegetation can survive water stress by forming spatial patterns but is often subjected to herbivory as an additional stress that puts it at risk of desertification. Understanding the mutual relationships between vegetation patterning and herbivory is crucial for securing food production in drylands, which constitute the majority of rangelands worldwide. Here, we introduce a novel vegetation-herbivore model that captures pattern-forming feedbacks associated with water and herbivory stress and a behavioral aspect of herbivores representing an exploitation strategy.Applying numerical continuation methods, we analyze the bifurcation structure of uniform and patterned vegetation-herbivore solutions, and use direct numerical simulations to study various forms of collective herbivore dynamics. We find that herbivory stress can induce traveling vegetation-herbivore waves and uncover the ecological mechanism that drives their formation. In the traveling-wave state, the herbivore distribution is asymmetric with higher density on one side of each vegetation patch. At low precipitation values their distribution is localized, while at high precipitation the herbivores are spread over the entire landscape. Importantly, their asymmetric distribution results in uneven herbivory stress, strong on one side of each vegetation patch and weak on the opposing side - weaker than the stress exerted in spatially uniform herbivore distribution. Consequently, the formation of traveling waves results in increased sustainability to herbivory stress. We conclude that vegetation-herbivore traveling waves may play an essential role in sustaining herbivore populations under conditions of combined water and herbivory stress, thereby contributing to food security in endangered regions threatened by droughts and population growth.</description>

      <title>Existence of solitary waves in particle lattices with power-law forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of small solitary waves for one-dimensional lattices of particles that each repel every other particle with a force that decays as a power of distance. For force exponents $\alpha+1$ with $\frac43&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, we employ fixed-point arguments to find near-sonic solitary waves having scaled velocity profiles close to non-degenerate solitary-wave profiles of fractional KdV or generalized Benjamin-Ono equations. These equations were recently found to approximately govern unidirectional long-wave motions in these lattices.</description>

      <title>Deformation dynamics of an oil droplet into a crescent shape during intermittent motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O by measuring the time-dependent paraffin/water interfacial tension with the pendant drop method. The observed effect can be explained by the active role of the oil red O molecules at the paraffin/water interface. The interfacial tension decreases gradually after the interface formation, allowing for the dynamic deformation of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the reduction in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal patterns in the active cyclic Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three-state Potts model is studied on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations and continuum theory. This model is relevant to chemical reactions on a catalytic surface and to molecular transport across a membrane. Several characteristic modes are formed depending on the flipping energies between successive states and the contact energies between neighboring sites. Under cyclic symmetry conditions, cycling homogeneous phases and spiral waves form at low and high flipping energies, respectively. In the intermediate flipping energy regime, these two modes coexist temporally in small systems and/or at low contact energies. Under asymmetric conditions, we observed small biphasic domains exhibiting amoeba-like locomotion and temporal coexistence of spiral waves and a dominant non-cyclic one-state phase. An increase in the flipping energy between two successive states, say state 0 and state 1, while keeping the other flipping energies constant, induces the formation of the third phase (state 2), owing to the suppression of the nucleation of state 0 domains. Under asymmetric conditions regarding the contact energies, two different modes can appear depending on the initial state, due to a hysteresis phenomenon.</description>
