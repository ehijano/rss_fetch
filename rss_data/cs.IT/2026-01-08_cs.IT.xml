      <title>LCPs of Subspace Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subspace code is a nonempty collection of subspaces of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^{n}$. A pair of linear codes is called a linear complementary pair (in short LCP) of codes if their intersection is trivial and the sum of their dimensions equals the dimension of the ambient space. Equivalently, the two codes form an LCP if the direct sum of these two codes is equal to the entire space. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LCPs of subspace codes. We first provide a characterization of subspace codes that form an LCP. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for the existence of an LCP of subspace codes based on a complement function on a subspace code. In addition, we give several constructions of LCPs for subspace codes using various techniques and provide an application to insertion error correction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a class of Hermitian LCD $2$-quasi-abelian codes over finite fields and presents a comprehensive enumeration of these codes in which relative minimum weights are small. We show that such codes are asymptotically good over finite fields. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to finite chain rings by characterizing $2$-quasi-abelian codes in this setting and proving the existence of asymptotically good Hermitian LCD $2$-quasi-abelian codes over finite chain rings as well.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Planar Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architecture Design Using Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enable programmable control of the wireless propagation environment and are key enablers for future networks. Beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) architectures enhance conventional RIS by interconnecting elements through tunable impedance components, offering greater flexibility with higher circuit complexity. However, excessive interconnections between BD-RIS elements require multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB) designs, increasing fabrication difficulty. In this letter, we use graph theory to characterize the BD-RIS architectures that can be realized on double-layer PCBs, denoted as planar-connected RISs. Among the possible planar-connected RISs, we identify the ones with the most degrees of freedom, expected to achieve the best performance under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>Unique Decoding of Hyperderivative Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes are combinatorial objects designed to cope with the problem of reliable transmission of information on a noisy channel. A fundamental problem in coding theory and practice is to efficiently decode the received word with errors to obtain the transmitted codeword. In this paper, we consider the decoding problem of Hyperderivative Reed-Solomon (HRS) codes with respect to the NRT metric. Specifically, we propose a Welch-Berlekamp algorithm for the unique decoding of NRT HRS codes.</description>

      <title>Flexible-Duplex Cell-Free Architecture for Secure Uplink Communications in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Serving Every Symbol: All-Symbol PIR and Batch Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $t$-all-symbol PIR code and a $t$-all-symbol batch code of dimension $k$ consist of $n$ servers storing linear combinations of $k$ linearly independent information symbols with the following recovery property: any symbol stored by a server can be recovered from $t$ pairwise disjoint subsets of servers. In the batch setting, we further require that any multiset of size $t$ of stored symbols can be recovered from $t$ disjoint subsets of servers. This framework unifies and extends several well-known code families, including one-step majority-logic decodable codes, (functional) PIR codes, and (functional) batch codes.
  In this paper, we determine the minimum code length for some small values of $k$ and $t$, characterize structural properties of codes attaining this optimum, and derive bounds that show the trade-offs between length, dimension, minimum distance, and $t$. In addition, we study MDS codes and the simplex code, demonstrating how these classical families fit within our framework, and establish new cases of an open conjecture from \cite{YAAKOBI2020} concerning the minimal $t$ for which the simplex code is a $t$-functional batch code.</description>

      <title>Expectation Propagation for Distributed Inference in Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grant-free cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (GF-CF-MaMIMO) systems are anticipated to be a key enabling technology for next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, as they support massive connectivity without explicit scheduling. However, the large amount of connected devices prevents the use of orthogonal pilot sequences, resulting in severe pilot contamination (PC) that degrades channel estimation and data detection performance. Furthermore, scalable GF-CF-MaMIMO networks inherently rely on distributed signal processing. In this work, we consider the uplink of a GF-CF-MaMIMO system and propose two novel distributed algorithms for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP). The first algorithm, denoted as JACD-EP, uses Gaussian approximations for the channel variables, whereas the second, referred to as JACD-EP-BG, models them as Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) random variables. To integrate the BG distribution into the EP framework, we derive its exponential family representation and develop the two algorithms as efficient message passing over a factor graph constructed from the a posteriori probability (APP) distribution. The proposed framework is inherently scalable with respect to both the number of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show the efficient mitigation of PC by the proposed distributed algorithms and their superior detection accuracy compared to (genie-aided) centralized linear detectors.</description>

      <title>A Quantifiable Information-Processing Hierarchy Provides a Necessary Condition for Detecting Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As intelligent systems are developed across diverse substrates - from machine learning models and neuromorphic hardware to in vitro neural cultures - understanding what gives a system agency has become increasingly important. Existing definitions, however, tend to rely on top-down descriptions that are difficult to quantify. We propose a bottom-up framework grounded in a system's information-processing order: the extent to which its transformation of input evolves over time. We identify three orders of information processing. Class I systems are reactive and memoryless, mapping inputs directly to outputs. Class II systems incorporate internal states that provide memory but follow fixed transformation rules. Class III systems are adaptive; their transformation rules themselves change as a function of prior activity. While not sufficient on their own, these dynamics represent necessary informational conditions for genuine agency. This hierarchy offers a measurable, substrate-independent way to identify the informational precursors of agency. We illustrate the framework with neurophysiological and computational examples, including thermostats and receptor-like memristors, and discuss its implications for the ethical and functional evaluation of systems that may exhibit agency.</description>

      <title>Strip-Symmetric Quantum Codes for Biased Noise: Z-Decoupling in Stabilizer and Floquet Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias-tailored codes such as the XZZX surface code and the domain wall color code achieve high dephasing-biased thresholds because, in the infinite-bias limit, their $Z$ syndromes decouple into one-dimensional repetition-like chains; the $X^3Z^3$ Floquet code shows an analogous strip-wise structure for detector events in spacetime. We capture this common mechanism by defining strip-symmetric biased codes, a class of static stabilizer and dynamical (Floquet) codes for which, under pure dephasing and perfect measurements, each elementary $Z$ fault is confined to a strip and the Z-detector--fault incidence matrix is block diagonal. For such codes the Z-detector hypergraph decomposes into independent strip components and maximum-likelihood $Z$ decoding factorizes across strips, yielding complexity savings for matching-based decoders. We characterize strip symmetry via per-strip stabilizer products, viewed as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, place XZZX, the domain wall color code, and $X^3Z^3$ in this framework, and introduce synthetic strip-symmetric detector models and domain-wise Clifford constructions that serve as design tools for new bias-tailored Floquet codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Drinfeld modules and rank metric codes, focusing on the case of semifield codes. Our framework constructs rank metric codes from linear subspaces of endomorphisms of a Drinfeld module, using tools such as characteristic polynomials on Tate modules and the Chebotarev density theorem. We show that Sheekey's construction [She20] fits naturally into this setting, yielding a short conceptual proof of one of his main results. We then give a new construction of infinite families of semifield codes arising from Drinfeld modules defined over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Computational hardness of estimating quantum entropies via binary entropy bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational hardness of estimating the quantum $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy ${\rm S}^{\tt R}_{\alpha}(\rho) = \frac{\ln {\rm Tr}(\rho^\alpha)}{1-\alpha}$ and the quantum $q$-Tsallis entropy ${\rm S}^{\tt T}_q(\rho) = \frac{1-{\rm Tr}(\rho^q)}{q-1}$, both converging to the von Neumann entropy as the order approaches $1$. The promise problems Quantum $\alpha$-R\'enyi Entropy Approximation (R\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$) and Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Approximation (TsallisQEA$_q$) ask whether $ {\rm S}^ {\tt R}_{\alpha}(\rho)$ or ${\rm S}^{\tt T}_q(\rho)$, respectively, is at least $\tau_{\tt Y}$ or at most $\tau_{\tt N}$, where $\tau_{\tt Y} - \tau_{\tt N}$ is typically a positive constant. Previous hardness results cover only the von Neumann entropy (order $1$) and some cases of the quantum $q$-Tsallis entropy, while existing approaches do not readily extend to other orders.
  We establish that for all positive real orders, the rank-$2$ variants Rank2R\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$ and Rank2TsallisQEA$_q$ are ${\sf BQP}$-hard. Combined with prior (rank-dependent) quantum query algorithms in Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Liu and Wang (SODA 2025), our results imply:
  - For all real orders $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $0 &lt; q \leq 1$, LowRankR\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$ and LowRankTsallisQEA$_q$ are ${\sf BQP}$-complete, where both are restricted versions of R\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$ and TsallisQEA$_q$ with $\rho$ of polynomial rank.
  - For all real order $q&gt;1$, TsallisQEA$_q$ is ${\sf BQP}$-complete.
  Our hardness results stem from reductions based on new inequalities relating the $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi or $q$-Tsallis binary entropies of different orders, where the reductions differ substantially from previous approaches, and the inequalities are also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Short-time Fourier Transform-based Signal Recovery for Modulo Analog-to-Digital Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a short-time Fourier transform-based method for reconstructing signals encoded using modulo analog-to-digital converters with 1-bit folding information. In contrast to existing Fourier-based reconstruction approaches that require complete access to the entire observation, the proposed technique performs reconstruction over short, overlapping segments, enabling significantly lower latency while preserving the recovery accuracy. We also address the spectral leakage introduced by the windowing operation by selecting window parameters that balance the leakage suppression and the computational complexity of the algorithm. In addition, we establish conditions under which the correct unfolding of the modulo samples is guaranteed, leading to a reconstruction error determined solely by the quantization noise at the output. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method enables modulo analog-to-digital converters to surpass the mean squared error performance of conventional analog-to-digital converters. Furthermore, the proposed recovery method offers improved reconstruction performance compared with higher-order difference-based recovery, particularly in low-resolution and low-sampling rate regimes.</description>

      <title>Covert Entanglement Generation and Secrecy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over $n$ channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>The Gray Area: Characterizing Moderator Disagreement on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volunteer moderators play a crucial role in sustaining online dialogue, but they often disagree about what should or should not be allowed. In this paper, we study the complexity of content moderation with a focus on disagreements between moderators, which we term the ``gray area'' of moderation. Leveraging 5 years and 4.3 million moderation log entries from 24 subreddits of different topics and sizes, we characterize how gray area, or disputed cases, differ from undisputed cases. We show that one-in-seven moderation cases are disputed among moderators, often addressing transgressions where users' intent is not directly legible, such as in trolling and brigading, as well as tensions around community governance. This is concerning, as almost half of all gray area cases involved automated moderation decisions. Through information-theoretic evaluations, we demonstrate that gray area cases are inherently harder to adjudicate than undisputed cases and show that state-of-the-art language models struggle to adjudicate them. We highlight the key role of expert human moderators in overseeing the moderation process and provide insights about the challenges of current moderation processes and tools.</description>

      <title>The Sequence Reconstruction of Permutations under Hamming Metric with Small Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem asks for the recovery of a sequence from multiple noisy copies, where each copy may contain up to $r$ errors. In the case of permutations on \(n\) letters under the Hamming metric, this problem is closely related to the parameter $N(n,r)$, the maximum intersection size of two Hamming balls of radius $r$. While previous work has resolved \(N(n,r)\) for small radii (\(r \leq 4\)) and established asymptotic bounds for larger \(r\), we present new exact formulas for \(r \in \{5,6,7\}\) using group action techniques. In addition, we develop a formula for \(N(n,r)\) based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group \(S_n\), along with an algorithm that enables computation of \(N(n,r)\) for larger parameters, including cases such as \(N(43,8)\) and \(N(24,14)\).</description>
