      <title>Metastable CoCu$_2$O$_3$ for molecular sensing and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable nanostructures are kinetically trapped in local energy minima featuring intriguing surface and material properties. To unleash their potential, there is a need for non-equilibrium processes capable of stabilizing a large range of crystal phases outside thermodynamic equilibrium conditions by closely and flexibly controlling atomic reactant composition, spatial temperature distribution and residence time. Here, we demonstrate the capture of metastable pseudo-binary metal oxides at room temperature with scalable combustion-aerosol processes. By a combination of X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and online flame characterization, we investigate the occurrence of metastable CoCu$_2$O$_3$ with controlled crystal size (4-16 nm) over thermodynamically stable CuO and Co$_3$O$_4$. Immediate practical impact is demonstrated by exceptional sensing and catalytic performance for air pollutant detection (e.g., 15 parts-per-billion benzene). This approach can be extended to various binary, ternary and high entropy oxides with even more components to access novel materials also promising for actuators, energy storage or solar cells.</description>

      <title>Non-Ergodic-Induced Negative Differential Piezoresponse in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit a unique competition between long-range and short-range interactions that can be tuned electrically which prioritizes these materials in a broad range of electro-mechanical energy-conversion technologies, including biomedical imaging and electric-charge generators. Here, we demonstrate differential negative piezoresponse by utilizing the short-range interactions in relaxor ferroelectrics. The effect was observed over a broad temperature range with local piezoresponse spectroscopy in unpoled samples, while no negative piezoresponse was observed when the material was pre-scan poled. These measurements suggest that the effect, that is promising for power-generation applications, originates from non-ergodic behavior. Complementary macroscale impedance and dielectric constant measurements as a function of temperature and frequency supported the mesoscopic findings. Bearing in mind the direct relationship between piezoresponse and capacitance, relaxor ferroelectrics appear as an excellent platform for the emerging technology of low-power negative-capacitance transistors.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Multi-parameter Terahertz Nano-micro Detector Based on Plasmon Polariton Atomic Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz signals hold significant potential for ultra-wideband communication and high-resolution radar, necessitating miniaturized detectors capable of multi-parameter detection of intensity, frequency, polarization, and phase. Conventional detectors cannot meet these requirements. Here, we propose plasmon polariton atomic cavities (PPAC) made from single-atom-thick graphene, demonstrating the monolithic multifunctional miniaturized detector. With a footprint one-tenth the incident wavelength, the detector offers benchmarking intensity-, frequency-, and polarization-sensitive detection, rapid response, and sub-diffraction spatial resolution, all operating at room temperature across 0.22 to 4.24 THz. We present the monolithic detection applications for free-space THz polarization-coded communication and stealth imaging of physical properties. These results showcase the PPAC's unique ability to achieve strong absorption and weak signal detection with a thickness of only 10^-5 of the excitation wavelength, which is inaccessible with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Voltage control of spin resonance in phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) in resistive switching materials can be triggered by an electric stimulus that produces significant changes in the electrical response. When these phases have distinct magnetic characteristics, dramatic changes in spin excitations are also expected. The transition metal oxide La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) is a ferromagnetic metal at low temperatures and a paramagnetic insulator above room temperature. When LSMO is in its metallic phase a critical electrical bias has been shown to lead to an MIT that results in the formation of a paramagnetic resistive barrier transverse to the applied electric field. Using spin-transfer ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that even for electrical biases less than the critical value that triggers the MIT, there is magnetic phase separation with the spin-excitation resonances varying systematically with applied bias. Thus, applied voltages provide a means to alter spin resonance characteristics of interest for neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Tandem Photovoltaics from 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-efficiency photovoltaic systems necessitates innovations that transcend the efficiency limitations of single-junction solar cells. This study investigates a tandem photovoltaic architecture comprising a top-cell with a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) superlattice absorber and a bottom-cell of crystalline silicon (c-Si), focusing on optimizing the light absorption and electrical performance of the combined structure. Through the transfer matrix method and electrical simulations, we optimized the geometry of the superlattice, determining that a siz-layer MoSe2 configuration with a 40 nm SiO2 antireflective layer maximizes photon absorption while mitigating additional weight and preserving the cell's structural integrity. The results show that the optimized TMDC superlattice significantly improves the PCE of the tandem design to 28.96%, and increase of 5.68% over the original single-junction c-Si solar cell's efficiency. This advancement illustrates the potential of TMDC material in next-generation solar cells and presents a promising avenue for the development of highly efficient, tandem photovoltaic systems via van der Waals integration of the top cell on c-Si</description>

      <title>Inverse design of programmable shape-morphing kirigami structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape-morphing structures have the capability to transform from one state to another, making them highly valuable in engineering applications. In this study, it is propose a two-stage shape-morphing framework inspired by kirigami structures to design structures that can deploy from a compacted state to a prescribed state under certain mechanical stimuli -- although the framework may also be extended to accommodate various physical fields, such as magnetic, thermal, and electric fields. The framework establishes a connection between the geometry and mechanics of kirigami structures. The proposed approach combines the finite element analysis (FEA), genetic algorithm (GA), and an analytical energy-based model to obtain kirigami designs with robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Integration of Programmable Diffraction with Digital Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging and sensing systems based on diffractive elements have seen massive advances over the last several decades. Earlier generations of diffractive optical processors were, in general, designed to deliver information to an independent system that was separately optimized, primarily driven by human vision or perception. With the recent advances in deep learning and digital neural networks, there have been efforts to establish diffractive processors that are jointly optimized with digital neural networks serving as their back-end. These jointly optimized hybrid (optical+digital) processors establish a new "diffractive language" between input electromagnetic waves that carry analog information and neural networks that process the digitized information at the back-end, providing the best of both worlds. Such hybrid designs can process spatially and temporally coherent, partially coherent, or incoherent input waves, providing universal coverage for any spatially varying set of point spread functions that can be optimized for a given task, executed in collaboration with digital neural networks. In this article, we highlight the utility of this exciting collaboration between engineered and programmed diffraction and digital neural networks for a diverse range of applications. We survey some of the major innovations enabled by the push-pull relationship between analog wave processing and digital neural networks, also covering the significant benefits that could be reaped through the synergy between these two complementary paradigms.</description>

      <title>Large and layer dependent nonlinear optical absorption of MXene 2D thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a rapidly expanding family of two dimensional (2D) materials, MXenes have recently gained considerable attention due to their appealing properties. Here, by developing a solution based coating method that enables transfer free and layer by layer film coating, we investigate the layer dependent nonlinear optical absorption of Ti3C2Tx films, an important member of the MXene family. By using the Zscan technique, we characterize the nonlinear absorption of the prepared MXene films consisting of different numbers of monolayers. The results show that there is a strong and layer dependent nonlinear absorption behavior, transitioning from revisable saturable absorption (RSA) to saturable absorption (SA) as the layer number increases from 5 to 30. Notably, the nonlinear absorption coefficient beta varies significantly within this range, changing from 7.13 x 100 cm/GW to -2.69 100 cm/GW. We also characterize the power dependent nonlinear absorption of the MXene films at various incident laser intensities, and a decreasing trend in beta is observed for increasing laser intensity. These results reveal the intriguing layer dependent nonlinear optical properties of 2D MXene films, highlighting their versatility and potential for implementing high-performance nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Anti-aliased metasurfaces beyond the Nyquist limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling is a pivotal element in the design of metasurfaces, enabling a broad spectrum of applications. Despite its flexibility, sampling can result in reduced efficiency and unintended diffractions, which are more pronounced at high numerical aperture or shorter wavelengths, e.g. ultraviolet spectrum. Prevailing metasurface research has often relied on the conventional Nyquist sampling theorem to assess sampling appropriateness, however, our findings reveal that the Nyquist criterion is insufficient for preventing the diffractive distortion. Specifically, we find that the performance of a metasurface is significantly correlated to the geometric relationship between the spectrum morphology and sampling lattice. Based on lattice-based diffraction analysis, we demonstrate several anti-aliasing strategies from visible to ultraviolet regimes. These approaches significantly reduce aliasing phenomena occurring in high numerical aperture metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>A hybrid graphene-siliconnitride nanomembrane as a versatile and ultra-widely tunable mechanical device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integration of 2D materials in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) marries the robustness of silicon-based materials with exceptional electrical controllability in 2D materials, drastically enhancing system performance which now is the key for many advanced applications in nanotechnology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and theoretically analyze a powerful on-chip graphene integrated NEMS device consisting of a hybrid graphene/silicon-nitride membrane with metallic leads that enables an extremely large static and dynamic parameter regulation. When a static voltage is applied to the leads, the force induced by the thermal expansion difference between the leads and the membrane results in ultra-wide frequency tuning, deformation (post-buckling transition) and regulation of mechanical properties. Moreover, by injecting an alternating voltage to the leads, we can excite the resonator vibrating even far beyond its linear regime without a complex and space consuming actuation system. Our results prove that the device is a compact integrated system possessing mechanical robustness, high controllability, and fast response. It not only expands the limit of the application range of NEMS devices but also pushes multidimensional nanomechanical resonators into working in the nonlinear regime.</description>

      <title>Extended-localized transition in diffusive quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to periodic systems, quasicrystals without translational invariance exhibit unexpected localization properties. The extended-localized transition in quasicrystals has been observed in both quantum and classical wave systems. However, its manifestation in diffusion systems, which serve as novel platforms for exploring phases of matter in condensed matter physics, remains unexplored. Here, we present the implementation of the extended-localized transition in a diffusive quasicrystal based on the coupled ring chain structure. By modulating the thermal conductivities of rings, we obtain the diffusive one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, which exhibits an extended-localized transition. Thanks to the ring-shaped chain, we clearly demonstrate the extended-localized transition under the uniform excitation through temperature field simulations. For the localized state, the temperature field clearly demonstrates a multiple localization centers phenomenon, which has no counterpart in wave systems. We also quantitatively investigate the temperature evolution and size effect of this transition. Furthermore, the local excitation has been adopted to demonstrate the temperature field for both the extended and localized states. Besides, we implement the non-Hermitian diffusive AAH model by rotating rings, whose temperature field shows a moving multiple localization centers phenomenon in the localized phase. Finally, we give the experimental suggestions for the diffusive AAH model and propose a potential application named as double-trace distributed generator. Our results can facilitate the design of flexible thermal devices and efficient heat management.</description>

Abstract: We investigate theoretically tunable non-Hermitian skin effect in systems with gain and loss, and find that bipolar (quadripolar) non-Hermitian skin effect characterized by topological invariants in one (two)-dimensional system. We also find the partial non-Hermitian skin effect with the coexistence of localized states and extended states. Both types of the non-Hermitian skin effect have not yet been predicted together in a single system. A feasible experimental scheme of our model is proposed to realize in electric circuits. Our investigation unveils a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect and enhance the tunability of the non-Hermitian systems by gain and loss other than the conventional non-reciprocal hopping.</description>

Abstract: Photovoltaic materials are recognized for their potential as sustainable energy sources that enable the conversion between light and electrical energy. However, solar cells have been unable to surpass the theoretical limit of 32%, known as the Shockley-Queisser limit, and face challenges in effectively utilizing the broad spectrum of sunlight. To address this issue, extensive research is being conducted on multi-junction solar cells, which employ a layered structure comprising materials with varying bandgaps to more effectively harness the wide spectrum of sunlight. This study calculates the theoretical limit of these multi-junction solar cells and identifies optimal bandgap combinations, exploring new possibilities for photovoltaic devices and suggesting directions for technological advancement. The performance saw a 31% improvement when moving from a single layer to two layers, and a 12% improvement from two layers to three, with the average wavelength situated in the late 800nm range. The wavelength of the bottom layer increased by about 200nm, and that of the second layer by about 150nm. Our findings present new opportunities to surpass the current limitations of solar cell technology, potentially enhancing the economic feasibility and utility of solar energy as a sustainable source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports on the investigation of cavitated silver paste produced by cavitation technology as a cost-effective alternative to traditional three-roll milling (TRM). Cavitation, utilizing high-frequency sound waves, enhances metal paste dispersion, reduces oxidation, extends shelf life, and minimizes waste. Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar cells made with cavitated silver paste achieved a 21% energy conversion efficiency, slightly lower than the 22% efficiency of conventional paste. Cavitated paste produced finer gridlines, reducing silver usage and costs but increasing contact resistance, leading to a lower fill factor. Despite this, cavitation technology shows promise for more efficient and cost-effective solar cell production. Further research is needed to optimize efficiency and resistance, highlighting the potential for cavitation technology in commercial applications.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials (2DM) and their derived heterostructures have electrical and optical properties that are widely tunable via several approaches, most notably electrostatic gating and interfacial engineering such as twisting. While electrostatic gating is simple and has been ubiquitously employed on 2DM, being able to tailor the interfacial properties in a similar real-time manner represents the next leap in our ability to modulate the underlying physics and build exotic devices with 2DM. However, all existing approaches rely on external machinery such as scanning microscopes, which often limit their scope of applications, and there is currently no means of tuning a 2D interface that has the same accessibility and scalability as electrostatic gating. Here, we demonstrate the first on-chip platform designed for 2D materials with in situ tunable interfacial properties, utilizing a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). Each compact, cost-effective, and versatile device is a standalone micromachine that allows voltage-controlled approaching, twisting, and pressurizing of 2DM with high accuracy. As a demonstration, we engineer synthetic topological singularities, known as merons, in the nonlinear optical susceptibility of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), via simultaneous control of twist angle and interlayer separation. The chirality of the resulting moire pattern further induces a strong circular dichroism in the second-harmonic generation. A potential application of this topological nonlinear susceptibility is to create integrated classical and quantum light sources that have widely and real-time tunable polarization. Our invention pushes the boundary of available technologies for manipulating low-dimensional quantum materials, which in turn opens up the gateway for designing future hybrid 2D-3D devices for condensed-matter physics, quantum optics, and beyond.</description>
