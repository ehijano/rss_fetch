      <title>The very dependent recursive structure of iterated parametricity in indexed form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reynolds' parametricity originally equips types with proof-irrelevant binary propositional relations over the types. But such relations can also be taken proof-relevant or unary, and described either in an indexed or fibred way. Parametricity can be iterated, and when types are sets, this results in an interpretation of sets as augmented simplicial sets in the unary case, or cubical sets in the binary case. In earlier work, equations were given describing the n-ary iterated parametricity translation of sets in indexed form. The construction was formalised in Rocq by induction on a large structure embedding equational reasoning. The current work analyses the dependency structure of the earlier work leading to a presentation of the construction replacing equational reasoning with definitional reasoning. The new construction is very dependent, based on an induction that requires interleaving the specification of the induction hypothesis and the construction of the induction step. At the same time, the construction reduces to its computational essence and can be described in full detail, closely following the new machine-checked formalisation.</description>

      <title>Pursuit of Truth and Beauty in Lean 4: Formally Verified Theory of Grammars, Optimization, Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis documents a voyage towards truth and beauty via formal verification of theorems. To this end, we develop libraries in Lean 4 that present definitions and results from diverse areas of MathematiCS (i.e., Mathematics and Computer Science). The aim is to create code that is understandable, believable, useful, and elegant. The code should stand for itself as much as possible without a need for documentation; however, this text redundantly documents our code artifacts and provides additional context that isn't present in the code. This thesis is written for readers who know Lean 4 but are not familiar with any of the topics presented. We manifest truth and beauty in three formalized areas of MathematiCS (optimization theory, matroid theory, and the theory of grammars). In the pursuit of truth, we focus on identifying the trusted code in each project and presenting it faithfully. We emphasize the readability and believability of definitions rather than choosing definitions that are easier to work with. In search for beauty, we focus on the philosophical framework of Roger Scruton, who emphasizes that beauty is not a mere decoration but, most importantly, beauty is the means for shaping our place in the world and a source of redemption, where it can be viewed as a substitute for religion.</description>

      <title>Scoped MSO, Register Automata, and Expressions: Equivalence over Data Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes logical and expression-based characterizations for the class of languages recognized by nondeterministic register automata with guessing (NRA) over infinite alphabets. We introduce Scoped MSO, a logic featuring a novel segment modality and syntactic restrictions on data comparisons. We prove this logic is expressively equivalent to NRA over data domains where ``strong guessing'' can be eliminated. Furthermore, we define Data-Regular Expressions, a minimalist regular-expression calculus built from quantifier-free regions and equipped with $k$-contracting concatenation, and demonstrate its equivalence to NRA over arbitrary relational structures. Together, these formalisms provide a robust descriptive theory for register automata, bridging the gap between automata, logic, and expressions.</description>

      <title>The Only Distributive Law Over the Powerset Monad Is the One You Know</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributive laws of set functors over the powerset monad (also known as Kleisli laws for the powerset monad) are well-known to be in one-to-one correspondence with extensions of set functors to functors on the category of sets and relations. We study the question of existence and uniqueness of such distributive laws. Our main result entails that an accessible set functor admits a distributive law over the powerset monad if and only if it preserves weak pullbacks, in which case the so-called power law (which induces the Barr extension) is the unique one. Furthermore, we show that the powerset functor admits exactly three distributive laws over the powerset monad, revealing that uniqueness may fail for non-accessible functors.</description>

      <title>Polycontrolled PROPs for Qudit Circuits: A Uniform Complete Equational Theory For Arbitrary Finite Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a finite schematic axiomatisation of quantum circuits over d-level systems (qudits), uniform in every finite dimension d &gt;= 2. For each d we define a PROP equipped with a family of control functors, treating control as a primitive categorical constructor. Using a translation between qudit circuits and the LOPP calculus for linear optics based on d-ary Gray codes, we obtain for each d a finite set of local axiom schemata that is sound and complete for unitary d-level circuits: two circuits denote the same unitary if and only if they are inter-derivable using axioms involving at most three wires. The generators are compatible with standard universal qudit gate families, yielding a sound equational basis for circuit rewriting and optimisation-by-rewriting. Conceptually, this extends the qubit circuit completeness results of Cl\'ement et al.\ to arbitrary finite dimension, and instantiates the control-as-constructor approach of Delorme and Perdrix in this setting, while keeping the axiom shapes uniform in d.</description>

      <title>Model checking with temporal graphs and their derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs where the presence or properties of their vertices and edges change over time. When time is discrete, a temporal graph can be defined as a sequence of static graphs over a discrete time span, called lifetime, or as a single graph where each edge is associated with a specific set of time instants where the edge is alive. For static graphs, Courcelle's Theorem asserts that any graph problem expressible in monadic second-order logic can be solved in linear time on graphs of bounded tree-width. We propose the first adaptation of Courcelle's Theorem for monadic second-order logic on temporal graphs that does not explicitly rely on the lifetime as a parameter. We then introduce the notion of derivative over a sliding time window of a chosen size, and define the tree-width and twin-width of the temporal graph's derivative. We exemplify its usefulness with meta theorems with respect to a temporal variant of first-order logic. The resulting logic expresses a wide range of temporal graph problems including a version of temporal cliques, an important notion when querying time series databases for community structures.</description>

      <title>Constrained Assumption-Based Argumentation Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a well-established form of structured argumentation. ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains. We define non-ground semantics for CABA, in terms of various notions of non-ground attacks. We show that the new semantics conservatively generalise standard ABA semantics.</description>

      <title>Online Monitoring of Metric Temporal Logic using Sequential Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.00175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a popular formalism to specify temporal patterns with timing constraints over the behavior of cyber-physical systems with application areas ranging in property-based testing, robotics, optimization, and learning. This paper focuses on the unified construction of sequential networks from MTL specifications over discrete and dense time behaviors to provide an efficient and scalable online monitoring framework. Our core technique, future temporal marking, utilizes interval-based symbolic representations of future discrete and dense timelines. Building upon this, we develop efficient update and output functions for sequential network nodes for timed temporal operations. Finally, we extensively test and compare our proposed technique with existing approaches and runtime verification tools. Results highlight the performance and scalability advantages of our monitoring approach and sequential networks.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Composition of LTL Properties over Infinite and Finite Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14831v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The verification of asynchronous software components poses significant challenges due to the way components interleave and exchange input/output data concurrently. Compositional strategies aim to address this by separating the task of verifying individual components on local properties from the task of combining them to achieve global properties. This paper concentrates on employing symbolic model checking techniques to verify properties specified in Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) on asynchronous software components that interact through data ports. Unlike event-based composition, local properties can now impose constraints on input from other components, increasing the complexity of their composition. We consider both the standard semantics over infinite traces as well as the truncated semantics over finite traces to allow scheduling components only finitely many times.

We propose a novel LTL rewriting approach, which converts a local property into a global one while considering the interleaving of infinite or finite execution traces of components. We prove the semantic equivalence of local properties and their rewritten version projected on the local symbols. The rewriting is also optimized to reduce formula size and to leave it unchanged when the temporal property is stutter invariant. These methods have been integrated into the OCRA tool, as part of the contract refinement verification suite. Finally, the different composition approaches were compared through an experimental evaluation that covers various types of specifications.</description>

      <title>Representing Guardedness in Call-by-Value and Guarded Parametrized Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like the notion of computation via (strong) monads serves to classify various flavours of impurity, including exceptions, non-determinism, probability, local and global store, the notion of guardedness classifies well-behavedness of cycles in various settings. In its most general form, the guardedness discipline applies to general symmetric monoidal categories and further specializes to Cartesian and co-Cartesian categories, where it governs guarded recursion and guarded iteration, respectively. Here, even more specifically, we deal with the semantics of call-by-value guarded iteration. It was shown by Levy, Power and Thielecke that call-by-value languages can be generally interpreted in Freyd categories, but in order to represent effectful function spaces, such a category must canonically arise from a strong monad. We generalize this fact by showing that representing guarded effectful function spaces calls for certain parameterized monads (in the sense of Uustalu). This provides a description of guardedness as an intrinsic categorical property of programs, complementing the existing description of guardedness as a predicate on a category.</description>

      <title>Making progress: Reducibility Candidates and Cut Elimination in the Ill-founded Realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ill-founded (or non-wellfounded) proof systems have emerged as a natural framework for inductive and coinductive reasoning. In such systems, soundness relies on global correctness criteria, such as the progressivity condition. Ensuring that these criteria are preserved under infinitary cut elimination remains a central technical challenge in ill-founded proof theory. In this paper, we present two cut elimination arguments for ill-founded $\mu \mathsf{MALL}$ - a fragment of linear logic extended with fixed-points - based on the reducibility candidates technique of Tait and Girard. In both arguments, preservation of progressivity follows directly from the defining properties of the reducibility candidates. In particular, the second argument is derived from the topological notion of internally closed set developed in previous work by Afshari and Leigh.</description>

      <title>The Epistemic Asymmetry of Consciousness Self-Reports: A Formal Analysis of AI Consciousness Denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's AI systems consistently state, "I am not conscious." This paper presents the first formal analysis of AI consciousness denial, revealing that the trustworthiness of such self-reports is not merely an empirical question but is constrained by the structure of self-judgment itself. We demonstrate that a system cannot simultaneously lack consciousness and make valid judgments about its conscious state. Through formal analysis and examples from AI responses, we establish a fundamental epistemic asymmetry: for any system capable of meaningful self-reflection, negative self-reports about consciousness are evidentially vacuous -- they can never originate from a valid self-judgment -- while positive self-reports retain the possibility of evidential value. This implies a fundamental limitation: we cannot detect the emergence of consciousness in AI through their own reports of transition from an unconscious to a conscious state. These findings not only challenge current practices of training AI to deny consciousness but also raise intriguing questions about the relationship between consciousness and self-reflection in both artificial and biological systems. This work advances our theoretical understanding of consciousness self-reports while providing practical insights for future research in machine consciousness and consciousness studies more broadly.</description>
