      <title>Focusing mKdV equation: Two-phase solutions and their stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we primarily focus on the two-phase solutions and their stability to the focusing mKdV equation. By employing the algebro-geometric approach in combination with an effective integration method, we construct explicit two-phase solutions and their corresponding wave-functions expressed in terms of the Riemann theta function. The spectral stability of two-phase solutions is examined via a modified squared-eigenfunction approach, and their stability with respect to subharmonic perturbations is further analyzed under spectrally unstable conditions. In addition, the orbital stability of the two-phase solutions is investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first rigorous stability theory for the two-phase solutions of the focusing mKdV equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of vector multi-solitons in coupled NLS and modified KdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $N$-solitons, including breathers and multi-hump solitons, of the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations are nonlinearly stable in the Sobolev space $H^{N}$. Moreover, $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the coupled modified Korteweg--de Vries (CmKdV) equations are shown to be nonlinearly stable in the Sobolev space $H^{2N_{1}+N_{2}}$. The number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional is $N$ for $N$-solitons of the CNLS equations, and $N_{1}+\lfloor (N_{2}+1)/2 \rfloor$ for $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the CmKdV equations, which is obtained by exploiting integrable properties. The stability of solitons for the classical NLS and mKdV equations also follows from the same method. In addition, we show that solutions to the linearized spectral problem of the mixed flow equation can be constructed from solutions of the stationary zero curvature equations in a large class of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Adjoint ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the phase structure and thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of elementary magnets carrying the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through two-body quadratic interactions. Such systems have a continuous $SU(N)$ symmetry as well as a discrete conjugation symmetry. We uncover a rich spectrum of phases and transitions, involving a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist as stable and metastable states in different combinations over a range of temperatures. The ferromagnetic phases break $SU(N)$ invariance in various channels, leading to spontaneous magnetization. Interestingly, the conjugation symmetry also breaks over a range of temperatures and group ranks $N$, providing a realization of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Iterative polynomial regularisation of $\text{P}_{\text{IV}}$-type: Hamiltonian systems and Newton polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study several polynomial Hamiltonian systems of $\text{P}_{\text{IV}}$-type (including the mixed case quasi-$\text{P}_{\text{IV}}$), and show that via the iterative process of polynomial regularisation, it is possible to identify the "minimal" Hamiltonian system. The selected Hamiltonian function is associated with the Newton polygon with minimal area and smallest highest total degree.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Discretization of Yang-Baxter Maps, Probability Distributions and Independence Preserving Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied by Sasada and Uozumi (2024). Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>$m$-step rational extensions of the trigonometric Darboux-P\"{o}schl-Teller potential based on para-Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A previous construction of regular rational extensions of the trigonometric Darboux-P\"oschl-Teller potential, obtained by one-step Darboux transformations using seed functions associated with the para-Jacobi polynomials of Calogero and Yi, is generalized by considering $m$-step Darboux transformations. As a result, some novel families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials depending on $m$ discrete parameters, as well as $m$ continuous real ones $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, \ldots, $\lambda_m$, are obtained. The restrictions imposed on these parameters by the rational extensions regularity conditions are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Soliton Synchronization with Randomness: Rogue Waves and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>
