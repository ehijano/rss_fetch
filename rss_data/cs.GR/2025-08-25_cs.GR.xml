      <title>Wavelet-Space Super-Resolution for Real-Time Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to 1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX 4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together, our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time 3D Light-field Viewing with Eye-tracking on Conventional Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating immersive 3D visual experiences typically requires expensive and specialized hardware such as VR headsets, autostereoscopic displays, or active shutter glasses. These constraints limit the accessibility and everyday use of 3D visualization technologies in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a low-cost system that enables real-time 3D light-field viewing using only a standard 2D monitor, a conventional RGB webcam, and red-cyan anaglyph glasses. The system integrates real-time eye-tracking to dynamically adapt the displayed light-field image to the user's head position with a lightweight rendering pipeline that selects and composites stereoscopic views from pre-captured light-field data. The resulting anaglyph image is updated in real-time, creating a more immersive and responsive 3D experience. The system operates entirely on CPU and maintains a stable frame rate of 30 FPS, confirming its feasibility on typical consumer-grade hardware. All of these highlight the potential of our approach as an accessible platform for interactive 3D applications in education, digital media, and beyond.</description>

      <title>PediatricsMQA: a Multi-modal Pediatrics Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support. However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias, compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI support in pediatric care.</description>

      <title>MeshCoder: LLM-Powered Structured Mesh Code Generation from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets, restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

      <title>AutoSketch: VLM-assisted Style-Aware Vector Sketch Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</description>
