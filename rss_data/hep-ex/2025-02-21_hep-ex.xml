      <title>Efficient Monte Carlo Event Generation for Neutrino-Nucleus Exclusive Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions need to incorporate sophisticated nuclear models to achieve greater predictive precision. However, the computational complexity of these advanced models often limits their practicality for experimental analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>PREFACE: A search for long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) fails to explain many problems (neutrino masses, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, among others) that may be resolved with new particles beyond the Standard model (BSM). The fact that such new particles are not yet observed may be explained either by their too high mass or by very small coupling to SM particles. The latter case implies long lifetimes. Such long-lived particles (LLPs) would have signatures different from those of SM particles. Searches in the ``central region" are covered by the LHC general purpose experiments. The forward small angle region far from the interaction point (IP) is unexplored. Such particles would have large energy $E$ = $\mathcal{O}$(1~TeV) and Lorentz time dilation factor $\gamma = E/m \approx 10^2 - 10^{3}$, hence long decay distances. A new class of specialized LHC detectors dedicated to LLP searches has been proposed for the forward regions. Among these experiments, FASER is already operational, and FACET is under consideration at a location 100 meters from IP5 (the CMS intersection). However, some features of FACET require a specially enlarged beam pipe, which cannot be implemented for Run 4. In this study, we explore a simplified version of the proposed detector, PREFACE, compatible with the standard LHC beam pipe in the HL-LHC in Run 4. Realistic \textsc{Geant4} simulations are performed and the background is evaluated. A preliminary analysis of the physics potential with the PREFACE geometry indicates that several significant channels could be accessible with sensitivities comparable to FACET and other LLP searches.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects in proton decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton decay detection could put in evidence physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this context, multiple projects are searching for such events. We focused our work on two of the expected decay modes, $p \rightarrow \pi^+ + \bar{\nu}$ and $p \rightarrow K^+ + \bar{\nu}$. Neutrinos are particles that interact very weakly with matter, so they are not of interest in our work. The detector materials investigated in this study include liquid argon (LAr), liquid xenon (LXe), and water (H$_2$O). Our analysis focuses on two key effects relevant to this decay process: the Fermi motion of nucleons and final state interactions. In addition to these effects, we have also examined the nuclear interaction of particles with the nuclei of the medium. This paper presents values for nucleon energy distribution, cross sections, mean free paths and interaction probabilities.</description>

      <title>Testing New Physics in Oscillations at a Neutrino Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neutrino factory is a potential successor to the upcoming generation of neutrino oscillation experiments and a possible precursor to next-generation muon colliders. Such a machine would provide a well characterized beam of $\nu_\mu$, $\bar\nu_\mu$, $\nu_e$, and $\bar\nu_e$ neutrinos with comparable statistics. Here we show the sensitivity of a neutrino factory to new oscillation physics scenarios such as vector neutrino non-standard interactions and CPT violation. We study two different potential setups for a neutrino factory with different assumptions on charge identification in the far detector. We find that a neutrino factory can improve over most of the current constraints on these scenarios and over forecasted constraints by DUNE, even when doubling DUNE's statistics. Additionally, we find that a neutrino factory can break degeneracies between the standard oscillation parameters and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters present at DUNE.</description>

      <title>Isolating Unisolated Upsilons with Anomaly Detection in CMS Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of anti-isolated Upsilon decays to two muons ($\Upsilon \to \mu^+ \mu^-$) in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Using a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection strategy, we "rediscover" the $\Upsilon$ in 13 TeV CMS Open Data from 2016, despite overwhelming anti-isolated backgrounds. We elevate the signal significance to $6.4 \sigma$ using these methods, starting from $1.6 \sigma$ using the dimuon mass spectrum alone. Moreover, we demonstrate improved sensitivity from using an ML-based estimate of the multi-feature likelihood compared to traditional "cut-and-count" methods. Our work demonstrates that it is possible and practical to find real signals in experimental collider data using ML-based anomaly detection, and we distill a readily-accessible benchmark dataset from the CMS Open Data to facilitate future anomaly detection developments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic Spectroscopy of an Electron and Positron for Precise Tests of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in sterile neutrino effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay provides an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Future neutrino experiments will improve the sensitivity to BNV nucleon decays and can serve to search for dark particles. In this work, we study the sterile neutrino effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light sterile neutrino on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-6 and dimension-7 EFT operator bases with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ or $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$. They are then matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian at low energies and the BNV interactions between the sterile neutrino and baryons and mesons. The rates of nucleon decay to SM neutrinos or a sterile neutrino are calculated. We then show the constraints on the ultraviolet scale from nucleon decay search at Super-K. The correlation of two EFT operators and the dependence on the sterile neutrino mass are also investigated.</description>

      <title>A Method to Simultaneously Facilitate All Jet Physics Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become an essential tool in jet physics. Due to their complex, high-dimensional nature, jets can be explored holistically by neural networks in ways that are not possible manually. However, innovations in all areas of jet physics are proceeding in parallel. We show that specially constructed machine learning models trained for a specific jet classification task can improve the accuracy, precision, or speed of all other jet physics tasks. This is demonstrated by training on a particular multiclass generation and classification task and then using the learned representation for different generation and classification tasks, for datasets with a different (full) detector simulation, for jets from a different collision system (pp versus ep), for generative models, for likelihood ratio estimation, and for anomaly detection. We consider, our OmniLearn approach thus as a jet-physics foundation model. It is made publicly available for use in any area where state-of-the-art precision is required for analyses involving jets and their substructure.</description>

      <title>Measurement of d2sigma/d|q|dEavail in charged current neutrino-nucleus interactions at &lt;Ev&gt; = 1.86 GeV using the NOvA Near Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double- and single-differential cross sections for inclusive charged-current neutrino-nucleus scattering are reported for the kinematic domain 0 to 2 GeV/c in three-momentum transfer and 0 to 2 GeV in available energy, at a mean muon-neutrino energy of 1.86 GeV. The measurements are based on an estimated 995,760 muon-neutrino CC interactions in the scintillator medium of the NOvA Near Detector. The subdomain populated by 2-particle-2-hole reactions is identified by the cross-section excess relative to predictions for neutrino-nucleus scattering that are constrained by a data control sample. Models for 2-particle-2- hole processes are rated by chi-square comparisons of the predicted-versus-measured muon-neutrino CC inclusive cross section over the full phase space and in the restricted subdomain. Shortfalls are observed in neutrino generator predictions obtained using the theory-based Val`encia and SuSAv2 2p2h models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an exploratory study of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ structure-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections to unique first-forbidden nuclear beta decays. We show that the insertion of angular momentum into the nuclear matrix element by the virtual/real photon exchange opens up the decay at vanishing nuclear recoil momentum which was forbidden at tree level, leading to a dramatic change in the decay spectrum not anticipated in existing studies. We discuss its implications for precision tests on the Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision determination of the $X(6200)$ parameters from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 126}, 132001 (2021), the LHCb data on the di-$J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions were analysed in a coupled-channel framework based on double-vector-charmonium channels. This investigation identified a robust pole near the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold, tagged $X(6200)$, suggesting it as a new state. The present work extends that investigation by incorporating recent di-$J/\psi$ production data from the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations and performing a combined analysis of all three datasets. This study confirms the existence of the $X(6200)$, and its pole position is now determined with a higher precision than in the previous study, where only a single dataset was employed. The pole corresponding to the $X(6900)$ is also extracted, though its actual position and residue depend on a particular coupled-channel model employed and deviate from values reported in the experimental investigations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the currently available data do not allow one to determine whether there is an additional pole in the studied mass range. The di-electron width of the $X(6200)$ is estimated under different conjectures on its quantum numbers, and the number of such states that can be annually produced at the future Super $\tau$-Charm Facility is estimated. The line shape in the complimentary $J/\psi\psi(2S)$ channel is discussed, and a good agreement with the ATLAS data is found.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: subleading contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using a recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector contributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis functions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor mesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a combined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints, supplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified assumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily propagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of the matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of hadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\times 10^{-11}$, which in combination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach leads to $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Isospin strikes back</title>

Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>

      <title>Measuring Top Yukawa Coupling through $2\rightarrow 3$ VBS at Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the measurement of top Yukawa coupling through $2\rightarrow 3$ VBS at future muon colliders, focusing on the lepton and semi-lepton channels of $\nu\nu tth/z$. First, analyzing the partonic amplitudes of $W_LW_L\rightarrow t\bar t h/Z_L$ and simulating the full processes of $\nu\nu tth/z$ without decaying, we find they are highly sensitive to the anomalous top Yukawa $\delta y_t$. This sensitivity is enhanced by selecting helicities of the final $t\bar t$ and $Z$ to be $t_L\bar t_L+t_R\bar t_R$ and $Z_L$, which serves as the default and core setting of our analysis. We then obtain the limits on $\delta y_t$ with this setting, giving $[-1.0\%, 1.1\%]$ for $\nu\nu tth$ only and $[-0.36\%, 0.92\%]$ for $\nu\nu tth$ and $\nu\nu ttz$ combined at $30$ TeV and $1\sigma$. Second, we proceed to analyze the processes after decaying and with background processes. To enhance the sensitivity to $\delta y_t$, our settings include selecting the helicities of the final particles, as well as applying suitable cuts. However, we don't do bin-by-bin analysis. We obtain the limits on $\delta y_t$ for those channels at $10/30$ TeV and $1\sigma/2 \sigma$. The best limit is from the semi-lepton channel of $\nu\nu tth$. With spin tagging efficiency at $\epsilon_s=0.9$, it gives $[-1.6\% , 1.8\%]$ at $1\sigma$ and $ [-2.4\%, 2.7\% ]$ at $2\sigma$ at $30$ TeV; $[-7.0\%, 6.7\%]$ at $1\sigma$ and $[-9.8\%, 9.8\%]$ at $2\sigma$ at $10$ TeV.</description>
