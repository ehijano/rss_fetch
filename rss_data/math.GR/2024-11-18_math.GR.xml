      <title>Proper actions and supported-section-valued cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a proper action of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ on a smooth (perhaps non-paracompact) manifold $M$. The $p^{th}$ cohomology $H^p(\mathbb{Z}^d,\ \Gamma_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathcal{F}))$ valued in the space of compactly-supported sections of a natural sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $M$ (such as those of smooth function germs, smooth $k$-form germs, etc.) vanishes for $p\ne d$ (the cohomological dimension of $\mathbb{Z}^d$) and, at $d$, equals the space of compactly-supported sections of the descent ($\mathbb{G}$-invariant push-forward) $\mathcal{F}/\mathbb{Z}^d$ to the orbifold quotient $M/\mathbb{Z}^d$. We prove this and analogous results on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ cohomology valued in $\Phi$-supported sections of an equivariant appropriately soft sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ in a broader context of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions proper with respect to a paracompactifying family of supports $\Phi$, in the sense that every member of $\Phi$ has a neighborhood small with respect to the action in Palais' sense.</description>

      <title>On the stability of hyperbolicity under quantitative measure equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result of Shalom says that lattices in SO$(n,1)$ are $L^p$ measure equivalent for all $p&lt;n-1$. His proof actually yields the following stronger statement: the natural coupling resulting from a suitable choice of fundamental domains from a uniform lattice $\Lambda$ to a uniform one $\Gamma$ is $(L^{\infty},L^p)$. Moreover, the fundamental domain of $\Gamma$ is contained in a union of finitely many translates of the fundamental domain of $\Lambda$. The purpose of this note is to prove a converse statement. More generally, it is proved that if a ME-coupling from a non-hyperbolic group $\Lambda$ to a hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ is $(L^{\infty},L^p)$ and the fundamental domain of $\Gamma$ is contained in a union of finitely many translates of the fundamental domain of $\Lambda$, then $p$ must be less than some $p_0$ only depending on $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Tessellations of an affine apartment by affine weight polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\A$ be a finite dimensional vector space and $\Phi$ be a finite root system in $\A$. To this data is associated an affine poly-simplicial complex. Motivated by a forthcoming construction of connectified higher buildings, we study "affine weight polytopes" associated to these data. We prove that these polytopes tesselate $\A$. We also prove a kind of "mixed" tessellation, involving the affine weight polytopes and the poly-simplical structure on $\A$.</description>

      <title>Triples of involutions in PGL(2,q) and their incidence geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $q = p^n$ with $p$ an odd prime, the projective linear group $PGL(2,q)$ can be seen as the stabilizer of a conic $O$ in a projective plane $\pi = PG(2,q)$. In that setting, involutions of $PGL(2,q)$ correspond bijectively to points of $\pi$ not in $O$. Triples of involutions $\{ \alpha_P,\alpha_Q,\alpha_R \}$ of $PGL(2,q)$ can then be seen also as triples of points $\{P,Q,R\}$ of $\pi$.
  We investigate the interplay between algebraic properties of the group $H = \langle \alpha_P,\alpha_Q,\alpha_R \rangle$ generated by three involutions and geometric properties of the triple of points $\{P,Q,R\}$. In particular, we show that the coset geometry $\Gamma = \Gamma(H,(H_0,H_1,H_2))$, where $H_0 = \langle \alpha_Q,\alpha_R \rangle, H_1 = \langle \alpha_P,\alpha_R \rangle$ and $H_2 = \langle \alpha_P,\alpha_Q \rangle$ is a regular hypertope if and only if $\{P,Q,R\}$ is a strongly non self-polar triangle, a terminology we introduce.
  This entirely characterizes hypertopes of rank $3$ with automorphism group a subgroup of $PGL(2,q)$.
  As a corollary, we obtain the existence of hypertopes of rank $3$ with non linear diagrams and with automorphism group $PGL(2,q)$, for any $q = p^n$ with $p$ an odd prime. We also study in more details the case where the triangle $\{P,Q,R\}$ is tangent to $O$.</description>

      <title>Spherical $p$-group complexes arising from finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $p$-group complex of a finite group $G$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension at most $n$ if $G$ contains a self-centralising normal subgroup $H$ which is isomorphic to a group of Lie type and Lie rank $n$ in characteristic $p$. If in addition every order-$p$ element of $G$ induces an inner or field automorphism on $H$, the $p$-group complex of $G$ is $G$-homotopy equivalent to a spherical complex obtained from the Tits building of $H$.
  We also prove that the reduced Euler characteristic of the $p$-group complex of a finite group $G$ is non-zero if $G$ has trivial $p$-core and $H$ is a self-centralising normal subgroup of $G$ which is a group of Lie type (in any characteristic), except possibly when $p=2$ and $H=A_n(4^a)$ ($n\geq 2$) or $E_6(4^a)$. In particular, we conclude that the Euler characteristic of the $p$-group complex of an almost simple group does not vanish for $p\geq 7$.</description>
