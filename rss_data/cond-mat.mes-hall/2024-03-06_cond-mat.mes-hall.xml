      <title>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents an accessible method to track transitions within the low-energy subspace and predict the output of braids with hybridized Majorana modes. As an application, we characterize Pauli qubit-errors, as demonstrated on an X-gate, critical for the successful operation of any quantum computer. Further, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement arbitrary rotations, along with a two-qubit controlled magic gate, thus providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Topological protection revealed by real-time longitudinal and transverse studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology provides an essential concept for achieving unchanged (or protected) quantum properties in the presence of perturbations. A challenge facing realistic applications is that the level of protection displayed in real systems is subject to substantial variations. Some key differences stem from mechanisms influencing the reconstruction behaviors of extended dissipationless modes. Despite various insightful results on potential causes of backscattering, the edge-state-based approach is limited because the bulk states, as shown by breakdown tests, contribute indispensably. This study investigates the influence of bulk reconstruction where dissipationless modes are global objects instead of being restricted to the sample edge. An integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) hosted in a Corbino sample geometry is adopted and brought continuously to the verge of a breakdown. A detection technique is developed to include two independent setups capable of simultaneously capturing the onset of dissipation in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The real-time correspondence between orthogonal results confirms two facts. 1. Dissipationless charge modes undergo frequent reconstruction in response to electrochemical potential changes, causing dissipationless current paths to expand transversely into the bulk while preserving chirality. A breakdown only occurs when a backscattering emerges between reconfigured dissipationless current paths bridging opposite edge contacts. 2. Impurity screening is vital in enhancing protection, and topological protection is subject to an intriguing interplay of disorder, electron-electron interaction, and topology. The proposed reconstruction mechanism qualitatively explains the robustness variations, beneficial for developing means for optimization.</description>

      <title>Generation of gigahertz frequency surface acoustic waves in YIG/ZnO heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/zinc oxide (ZnO) heterostructures, comparing the results of a computationally lightweight analytical model with time-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering data. Interdigital transducers (IDTs), with operational frequencies in the gigahertz regime, were fabricated on 50 and 100nm thin films of YIG prior to sputter deposition of 830nm and 890nm films of piezoelectric ZnO. We find good agreement between our analytical model and micro-focused Brillouin light scattering data of the IDT frequency response and SAW group velocity, with clear differentiation between the Rayleigh and Sezawa-like modes. This work paves the way for the study of SAW-spin wave (SW) interactions in low SW damping YIG, with the possibility of a method for future energy-efficient SW excitation.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological insulators have expanded into the nonlinear regime, while the bulk-edge correspondence in strongly nonlinear systems has been unelucidated. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit a transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical magnetic flux for Weyl points in the three-dimensional Hofstadter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the band structure of the three-dimensional Hofstadter model on cubic lattices, with an isotropic magnetic field oriented along the diagonal of the cube with flux $\Phi=2 \pi \cdot m /n$, where $m,n$ are co-prime integers. Using reduced exact diagonalization in momentum space, we show that, at fixed $m$, there exists an integer $n(m)$ associated with a specific value of the magnetic flux, that we denote by $\Phi_c(m) \equiv 2 \pi \cdot m/n(m)$, separating two different regimes. The first one, for fluxes $\Phi&lt;\Phi_c(m)$, is characterized by complete band overlaps, while the second one, for $\Phi&gt;\Phi_c(m)$, features isolated band touching points in the density of states and Weyl points between the $m$- and the $(m+1)$-th bands. In the Hasegawa gauge, the minimum of the $(m+1)$-th band abruptly moves at the critical flux $\Phi_c(m)$ from $k_z=0$ to $k_z=\pi$. We then argue that the limit for large $m$ of $\Phi_c(m)$ exists and it is finite: $\lim_{m\to \infty} \Phi_c(m) \equiv \Phi_c$. Our estimate is $\Phi_c/2\pi=0.1296(1)$. Based on the values of $n(m)$ determined for integers $m\leq60$, we propose a mathematical conjecture for the form of $\Phi_c(m)$ to be used in the large-$m$ limit. The asymptotic critical flux obtained using this conjecture is $\Phi_c^{{\rm (conj)}}/2\pi=7/54$.</description>

      <title>Suppressed localization effects in topological insulator -- antiferromagnetic insulator thin film bilayers of (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$-MnF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films of co-doped (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ (0001) are grown via molecular beam epitaxy on substrates of Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001), MgF$_2$ (110) and a thin film of the antiferromagnetic insulator MnF$_2$ (110). Magnetoconductivity measurements of these (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ films show weak antilocalization at low temperature that is suppressed in (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ films grown on a MnF$_2$ layer, an effect attributed either to enhanced magnetic scattering at the interface or a proximity induced energy gap at the Dirac point. The (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ films are fit to a model describing the magnetoconductivity corrections in the 2D Dirac surface state of the topological insulator, from which the approximate value of the Fermi velocity near the Dirac point is derived. The (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ - MnF$_2$ bilayer samples are fit to a model describing the crossover from weak antilocalization to weak localization due to magnetic doping, suggesting the opening of an energy gap at the Dirac point in the (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ due to proximity with the antiferromagnetic MnF$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nematic Ising superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High hydrostatic pressures can be used to induce flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene, at twist angles larger than those realizing the usual magic-angle condition. Here, we characterize the emerging spin-degenerate correlated insulator phases for a (magic) twist angle of $\theta=3.5^\circ$ at even integer filling factors $\nu=0,\pm2$ by relying on an exact self-consistent real-space Hartree-Fock approach that accounts for the screened long-range Coulomb interaction $\epsilon$ as well as the on-site Hubbard interaction $U$. We further present a novel algorithm that maps the full real-space density matrix to a reduced density matrix based on a $SU(4)$ symmetry of sublattice and valley degree of freedom. At charge-neutrality, we obtain a pure state of a Kramers intervalley coherent insulator localized on the moir\'e unit cell with a trivial gap. For $\nu=\pm2$, we obtain a mixed state, either valley polarized or valley coherent with Chern number $|C|=1$ pero spin-channel. In the weak coupling limit $\epsilon=54$ and $U=4$eV, this leads to nematic Ising superconductivity for $\nu=-2.4$ and conventional triplet superconductivity for $\nu=2.3$, that can experimentally be tested.</description>

      <title>Four-band effective square lattice model for Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) provides an ideal basis for gate-controlled, and free of etching, electronic devices. Theoretical modeling of realistic devices is an essential part of research, however, simulations of large-scale BLG devices continue to be extremely challenging. Micrometer-sized systems are predominantly beyond the reach of the commonly used atomistic tight-binding method, while other numerical approaches based on the two dimensional Dirac equation are not straightforward to conduct due to the fermion doubling problem. Here we present an approach based on the continuum model, unharmed by the fermion doubling. The discretization of the BLG continuum Hamiltonian leads to an effective four-band model, with both valleys built-in. We demonstrate its performance with realistic, large-scale systems, and obtain results consistent with experiments and with the tight-binding model, over a broad range of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase for $\alpha_z &lt; \alpha_{xy}$.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin fluctuations in superconductors with intersublattice and interorbital interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiband superconductors have featured one of the main challenges to achieve a comprehensive understanding of unconventional superconductivity. Here, the multiband character is studied separately as orbital and sublattice degrees of freedom, as they have different effects for the superconducting and magnetic or charge orders. We build on the framework of the matrix random-phase approximation (RPA), which accounts for the RPA Feynman diagrams and also vertex corrections, to treat the electron-electron interactions in an off-site degenerate Hubbard model. As a result, systems without a sublattice degree of freedom tend to be dominated by spin fluctuations, while systems with multiple sublattice sites and orbitals have the charge fluctuations favored. Finally, we explicitly demonstrate that the known suppression of the superconducting pairing strength $\lambda$ by spin fluctuations from repulsive interactions at zero momentum transfer $\boldsymbol{q}$ is countered by the finite-$\boldsymbol{q}$ pairing, which always improves $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermopower of nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied along the direction of the nodal line, the large degeneracy of states leads to a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of equilibrium phase transition in confined fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from that of bulk fluids due to the former's interactions with the surrounding heterogeneous structure. For example, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) create a strong heterogeneous field, so adsorbed fluids in MOFs have atypical phase characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase transitions. These characteristics are modeled by decoupling the host-guest and guest-guest interactions as a many-body problem in the presence of an external nonuniform field. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use mean-field theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's (f)-functions to describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory of nanothermodynamics, we define differential and integral thermodynamic functions to describe confined fluids. These integral properties are then used to understand the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller pores undergo a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in confined fluids than in bulk fluids, which helps explain the lower condensation pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.</description>

      <title>Deformation of a N\'eel-type Skyrmion in a Weak Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field: Magnetization Ansatz and Interaction with a Pearl Vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theory of (meta)stable states of N\'eel-type skyrmions in weak nonuniform magnetic fields. We claim an Ansatz for modeling the non-symmetric magnetization that can be implied for both analytics and numerical simulations. Our theory accounts for changes in the size of skyrmion parameters and also includes deformations from the centrally symmetric shape. The ansatz streamlines the analytic calculation of the skyrmion free energy, enhancing the efficiency of the minimizing process. Performing the minimization in two stages, one can find all the minima, global and local, of the free energy, discovering the stable and metastable states. We apply the developed methodology to investigate the (meta)stable configurations of skyrmions influenced by the stray field of a Pearl vortex. Our study reveals the dependence of skyrmion spatial parameters on the vortex field effective strength and presents a phase diagram identifying regions where metastable configurations are predicted. Corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, our findings offer a detailed perspective on the interaction between magnetic skyrmions and superconducting vortices.</description>

      <title>Impact of strain on the SOT-driven dynamics of thin film Mn$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mn$_3$Sn, a metallic antiferromagnet with an anti-chiral 120$^\circ$ spin structure, generates intriguing magneto-transport signatures such as a large anomalous Hall effect, spin-polarized current with novel symmetries, anomalous Nernst effect, and magneto-optic Kerr effect. When grown epitaxially as MgO(110)[001]$\parallel$ Mn$_3$Sn($0\bar{1}\bar{1}0$)[0001], Mn$_3$Sn experiences a uniaxial tensile strain, which changes the bulk six-fold anisotropy landscape to a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with two stable states. In this work, we investigate the field-assisted spin orbit-torque (SOT)-driven response of the order parameter in single-domain Mn$_3$Sn with uniaxial tensile strain. We find that for a non-zero external magnetic field, the order parameter can be switched between the two stable states if the magnitude of the input current is between two field-dependent critical currents. Below the lower critical current, the order parameter exhibits a stationary state in the vicinity of the initial stable state. On the other hand, above the higher critical current, the order parameter shows oscillatory dynamics which could be tuned from the 100's of megahertz to the gigahertz range. We obtain approximate expressions of the two critical currents and find them to agree very well with the numerical simulations for experimentally relevant magnetic fields. We also obtain unified functional form of the switching time versus the input current for different magnetic fields. Finally, we show that for lower values of Gilbert damping ($\alpha \leq 2\times 10^{-3}$), the critical currents and the final steady states depend significantly on the damping constant. The numerical and analytic results presented in our work can be used by both theorists and experimentalists to understand the SOT-driven order dynamics in PMA Mn$_3$Sn and design future experiments and devices.</description>

      <title>Full-magnetic implementation of a classical Toffoli gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Toffoli gate is the essential ingredient for reversible computing, an energy efficient classical computational paradigm that evades the energy dissipation resulting from Landauer's principle. In this paper we analyze different setups to realize a magnetic implementation of the Toffoli gate using three interacting classical spins, each one embodying one of the three bits needed for the Toffoli gate. In our scheme, different control-spins configurations produce an effective field capable of conditionally flipping the target spin. We study what are the experimental requirements for the realization of our scheme, focusing on the degree of local control, the ability to dynamically switch the spin-spin interactions, and the required single-spin anisotropies to make the classical spin stable, showing that these are compatible with current technology.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics with lattice regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is induced by the interplay between photon fields and boundary conditions, and in particular, photon fields modified in axion electrodynamics may lead to the sign-flipping of the Casimir energy. We propose a theoretical approach to derive the Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics. This approach is based on a lattice regularization and enables us to discuss the dependence on the lattice spacing for the Casimir energy. With this approach, the sign-flipping behavior of the Casimir energy is correctly reproduced. By taking the continuum limit of physical quantity calculated on the lattice, we can obtain the results consistent with the continuum theory. This approach can also be applied to the Casimir effect at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states in superconductor-barrier-superconductor junctions of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a superconductor-barrier-superconductor configuration built with Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal, which features four bands crossing at a single nodal point. Assuming a homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and the barrier region created by applying a voltage of magnitude $V_0 $ across a piece of normal state semimetal, we apply the BdG formalism to compute the discrete energy spectrum $\varepsilon $ of the subgap Andreev bound states in the short-barrier regime. In contrast with the two-band semimetals studied earlier, we find upto four pairs of localized states (rather than one pair for two-band semimetals) in the thin-barrier limit, and each value of $\varepsilon $ has a complicated dependence on the phase difference $\varphi_{12} $ via cosine and sine functions, which cannot be determined analytically. These are artifacts of multi-band nodes hosting quasiparticles of pseudospin values greater than $1/2$. Using the bound state energies, we compute the Josephson current across the junction configuration.</description>

      <title>Doped Mott phase and charge correlations in monolayer 1T-NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The doped Hubbard model is one of the paradigmatic platforms to engineer exotic quantum many-body states, including charge-ordered states, strange metals and unconventional superconductors. While undoped and doped correlated phases have been experimentally realized in a variety twisted van der Waals materials, experiments in monolayer materials, and in particular 1T transition metal dichalcogenides, have solely reached the conventional insulating undoped regime. Correlated phases in monolayer two-dimensional materials have much higher associated energy scales than their twisted counterparts, making doped correlated monolayers an attractive platform for high temperature correlated quantum matter. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a doped Mott phase in a van der Waals dichalcogenide 1T-NbSe$_2$ monolayer. The system is electron doped due to electron transfer to a monolayer van der Waals substrate via proximity, leading to a correlated triangular lattice with both half-filled and fully-filled sites. We analyze the distribution of the half-filled and filled sites and show the arrangement is unlikely to be controlled by disorder alone, and we show that the presence of competing non-local many-body correlations would account for the charge correlations found experimentally. Our results establish 1T-NbSe$_2$ as a potential monolayer platform to explore correlated doped Mott physics in a frustrated lattice.</description>

      <title>Giant DC Residual Current Generated by Subcycle Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental indications have been reported suggesting that laser pulses shining on materials with relativistic dispersion can produce currents that survive long after the illumination has died out. Such residual currents ('remnants') have applications in petahertz logical gates. The remnants' strength strongly depends on the pulse-shape. We develop an analytical formula that allows to optimize the pulse-shape for remnant production; we predict remnants exceeding the values observed so far by orders of magnitude. In fact, remnants can be almost as strong as the peak current under irradiation.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions in Kitaev chains side-coupled to normal metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a NM side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -- a topological invariant -- to characterize the phase transitions.</description>
