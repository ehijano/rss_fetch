      <title>Hierarchical Quasi-cyclic Codes from Reed-Solomon and Polynomial Evaluation Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first example of algebraically constructed hierarchical quasi-cyclic codes. These codes are built from Reed-Solomon codes using a 1964 construction of superimposed codes by Kautz and Singleton. We show both the number of levels in the hierarchy and the index of these Reed-Solomon derived codes are determined by the field size. We show that this property also holds for certain additional classes of polynomial evaluation codes.
  We provide explicit code parameters and properties as well as some additional bounds on parameters such as rank and distance. In particular, starting with Reed-Solomon codes of dimension $k=2$ yields hierarchical quasi-cyclic codes with Tanner graphs of girth 6.
  We present a table of small code parameters and note that some of these codes meet the best known minimum distance for binary codes, with the additional hierarchical quasi-cyclic structure. We draw connections to similar constructions in the literature, but importantly, while existing literature on related codes is largely simulation-based, we present a novel algebraic approach to determining new bounds on parameters of these codes.</description>

      <title>Continuous Angular Power Spectrum Recovery From Channel Covariance via Chebyshev Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Chebyshev polynomial expansion framework for the recovery of a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from channel covariance. By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting. These findings indicate that jointly exploiting smoothness and nonnegativity in a Chebyshev domain provides an effective tool for covariance-domain processing in multi-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Random Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.</description>

      <title>When Wires Can't Keep Up: Reconfigurable AI Data Centers Empowered by Terahertz Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in modern data centers demands a radical transformation of interconnect architectures. Traditional copper and optical wiring face fundamental challenges in latency, power consumption, and rigidity, constraining the scalability of distributed AI clusters. This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions. The article concludes with a roadmap toward wireless-defined, reconfigurable, and sustainable AI data centers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decoding of Twisted GRS Codes and Roth--Lempel Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MDS codes play a central role in practice due to their broad applications. To date, most known MDS codes are generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes, leaving codes that are not equivalent to GRS codes comparatively less understood. Studying this non-GRS regime is therefore of intrinsic theoretical interest, and is also practically relevant since the strong algebraic structure of GRS codes can be undesirable in cryptographic settings. Among the known non-GRS codes, twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes and Roth-Lempel codes are two representative families of non-GRS codes that have attracted significant attention. Though substantial work has been devoted to the construction and structural analysis of TGRS and Roth-Lempel codes, comparatively little attention has been paid to their decoding, and many problems remain open. In this paper, we propose list and unique decoding algorithms for TGRS codes and Roth-Lempel codes based on the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm. Under suitable parameter conditions, our algorithms achieve near-linear running time in the code length, improving upon the previously best-known quadratic-time complexity. Our TGRS decoder supports fixed-rate TGRS codes with up to O(n^2) twists, substantially extending prior work that only handled the single-twist case. For Roth-Lempel codes, we provide what appears to be the first efficient decoder. Moreover, our list decoders surpass the classical unique-decoding radius for a broad range of parameters. Finally, we incorporate algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes into the list-decoding framework, enabling recovery of the correct message from the output list with high probability.</description>

      <title>SC-LDPC Codes Over $\mathbb{F}_q$: Minimum Distance, Decoding Analysis and Threshold Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate random spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) code ensembles over finite fields. Under different variable-node edge-spreading rules, the random Tanner graphs of several coupled ensembles are defined by multiple independent, uniformly random monomial maps. The two main coupled ensembles considered are referred to as the standard coupled ensemble and the improved coupled ensemble. We prove that both coupled ensembles exhibit asymptotically good minimum distance and minimum stopping set size. Theoretical and numerical results show that the improved coupled ensemble can achieve better distance performance than the standard coupled ensemble. We introduce the essential preliminaries and analytical tools needed to analyze the iterative decoding threshold of coupled ensembles over any finite field. We consider a class of memoryless channels with special symmetry, termed q-ary input memoryless symmetric channels (QMSCs), and show that, for these channels, the distribution of channel messages (in form of probability vectors) likewise exhibits this symmetry. Consequently, we define symmetric probability measures and their reference measures on a finite-dimensional probability simplex, analyze their foundational properties and those of their linear functionals, endow their respective spaces with metric topologies, and conduct an in-depth study of their degradation theory. Based on our analytical framework, we establish a universal threshold saturation result for both of the coupled ensembles over a q-ary finite field on QMSCs. Specifically, as the coupling parameters increase, the belief-propagation threshold of a coupled system saturates to a well-defined threshold that depends only on the underlying ensemble and the channel family.</description>

      <title>Infinite families of graphs and stable completion of arbitrary matrices, Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic constructions of graphs for which the unique completion of low rank matrices is generically possible regardless of the values of the entries. We relate the completability to the presence of some patterns (particular unions of self-avoiding walks) in the subgraph of the lattice graph generated from the support of the bi-adjacency matrix. The construction makes it possible to design infinite families of graphs on which exact and stable completion is possible for every fixed rank matrix through the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Throughput Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS under Jittering and Imperfect CSI via DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can reshape wireless propagation on-demand. However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers.</description>

      <title>On maximum distance separable and completely regular codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate when a maximum distance separable ($MDS$) code over $F_q$ is also completely regular ($CR$). For lengths $n=q+1$ and $n=q+2$ we provide a complete classification of the $MDS$ codes that are $CR$ or at least uniformly packed in the wide sense ($UPWS$). For the more restricted case $n\leq q$ with $q\leq 5$ we obtain a full classification (up to equivalence) of all nontrivial $MDS$ codes: there are none for $q=2$; only the ternary Hamming code for $q=3$; four nontrivial families for $q=4$; and exactly six linear $MDS$ codes for $q=5$ (three of which are $CR$ and one admits a self-dual version). Additionally, we close two gaps left open in a previous classification of self-dual $CR$ codes with covering radius $\rho\leq 3$: we precisely determine over which finite fields the $MDS$ self-dual completely regular codes with parameters $[2,1,2]_q$ and $[4,2,3]_q$ exist.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Semantic Communications via Multi-Task Learning and Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.</description>

      <title>The Wigner-Ville Transform as an Information Theoretic Tool in Radio-frequency Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents novel interpretations to the field of classical signal processing of the Wigner-Ville transform as an information measurement tool. The transform's utility in detecting and localizing information-laden signals amidst noisy and cluttered backgrounds, and further providing measure of their information volumes, are detailed herein using Tsallis' entropy and information and related functionals. Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines. Such an advantage is particularly significant for applications which have limitations on observation resources including time/space integration pressures and transient and/or feeble signals, where Wigner-Ville-based methods would improve sensing effectiveness by multiple orders of magnitude. The potential for advancement of several such applications is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Pilot and Data Payload Optimization Framework for OTFS-Based ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signal is considered a promising solution for high-mobility wireless environments. It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.</description>

      <title>A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.
  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.</description>

      <title>Approximate Computation via Le Cam Simulability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a decision-theoretic framework for computational complexity, complementary to classical theory: moving from syntactic exactness (Turing / Shannon) to semantic simulability (Le Cam). While classical theory classifies problems by the cost of exact solution, modern computation often seeks only decision-valid approximations. We introduce a framework where "computation" is viewed as the efficient simulation of a target statistical experiment within a bounded risk distortion (Le Cam deficiency).
  We formally define computational deficiency ($\delta_{\text{poly}}$) and use it to construct the complexity class LeCam-P (Decision-Robust Polynomial Time), characterizing problems that may be syntactically hard but semantically easy to approximate. We show that classical Karp reductions can be viewed as zero-deficiency simulations, and that approximate reductions correspond to bounded deficiency. Furthermore, we establish the No-Free-Transfer Inequality, showing that strictly invariant representations inevitably destroy decision-relevant information. This framework offers a statistical perspective on approximation theory, bridging the gap between algorithmic complexity and decision theory.</description>

      <title>Almost perfect nonlinear power functions with exponents expressed as fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite field, let $f$ be a function from $F$ to $F$, and let $a$ be a nonzero element of $F$. The discrete derivative of $f$ in direction $a$ is $\Delta_a f \colon F \to F$ with $(\Delta_a f)(x)=f(x+a)-f(x)$. The differential spectrum of $f$ is the multiset of cardinalities of all the fibers of all the derivatives $\Delta_a f$ as $a$ runs through $F^*$. An almost perfect nonlinear (APN) function is one for which the largest cardinality in its differential spectrum is $2$. Almost perfect nonlinear functions are of interest as cryptographic primitives. If $d$ is a positive integer, then the power function over $F$ with exponent $d$ is the function $f \colon F \to F$ with $f(x)=x^d$ for every $x \in F$. There is a small number of known infinite families of APN power functions. In this paper, we re-express the exponents for one such family in a more convenient form. This enables us not only to obtain the differential spectrum of each power function $f$ with an exponent in our family, but also to determine the elements that lie in an arbitrary fiber of the discrete derivative of $f$. This differential analysis, which is far more detailed than previous results, is achieved by composing the discrete derivative of $f$ with some permutations and a double covering of its domain to obtain a function whose fibers can more readily be analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits.
  We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Users in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Stream Allocation and Necessity of Downlink Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple antennas on the users and access points (APs). In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well for single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent when having multi-antenna users. The reason is that the effective channel matrix does not harden. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme, derive a new SE expression, and show numerically that it yields substantially higher performance when having correlated Rayleigh fading channels.
  In cases with multi-antenna users, the APs can either transmit the same or different data streams. The latter reduces the fronthaul signaling but comes with a SE loss. We propose precoding and combining schemes for these cases and consider whether channel knowledge is shared between the APs. Finally, we show numerically how the number of users, APs, and the number of antennas on users and APs affect the SE.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Deep Learning-Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems on Resource-Limited Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Information Bottleneck Theory for Multi-Modal Task-Aware Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication shifts the focus from bit-level accuracy to task-relevant semantic delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication for next-generation networks. However, existing multi-modal solutions often process all available data modalities indiscriminately, ignoring that their contributions to downstream tasks are often unequal. This not only leads to severe resource inefficiency but also degrades task inference performance due to irrelevant or redundant information. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel task-aware distributed information bottleneck (TADIB) framework, which quantifies the contribution of any set of modalities to given tasks. Based on this theoretical framework, we design a practical coding scheme that intelligently selects and compresses only the most task-relevant modalities at the transmitter. To find the optimal selection and the codecs in the network, we adopt the probabilistic relaxation of discrete selection, enabling distributed encoders to make coordinated decisions with score function estimation and common randomness. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our solution matches or surpasses the inference quality of full-modal baselines while significantly reducing communication and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Adversarial Servers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index of the desired message secret from the servers. PIR schemes have been extended to various scenarios with adversarial servers: PIR schemes where some servers are unresponsive or return noisy responses are called robust PIR and Byzantine PIR, respectively; PIR schemes where some servers collude to reveal the index are called colluding PIR. The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies. However, systematic ways to construct PIR schemes that achieve the upper bound are not known. In order to construct a capacity-achieving PIR schemes systematically, it is necessary to clarify the conditions that the queries should satisfy. This paper proves the necessary and sufficient conditions for capacity-achieving PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PLS of Indoor IRS-VLC Systems for Colluding and Non-Colluding Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided indoor visible light communication (VLC) studies ignore the time delays introduced by reflected paths, even though these delays are inherent in practical wideband systems. In this work, we adopt a realistic assumption of IRS-induced time delay for physical layer security (PLS) enhancement. We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\% and 235\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user. These results demonstrate that time-delay-based IRS control can provide a strong secrecy advantage in practical indoor VLC scenarios.</description>

      <title>A New Family of Binary Sequences via Elliptic Function Fields over Finite Fields of Odd Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the constructions of binary sequences by utilizing the cyclic elliptic function fields over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}$ by Jin \textit{et al.} in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 71(8), 2025], we extend the construction to the cyclic elliptic function fields with odd characteristic by using the quadratic residue map $\eta$ instead of the trace map used therein. For any cyclic elliptic function field with $q+1+t$ rational points and any positive integer $d$ with $\gcd(d, q+1+t)=1$, we construct a new family of binary sequences of length $q+1+t$, size $q^{d-1}-1$, balance upper bounded by $(d+1)\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor+|t|+d,$ the correlation upper bounded by $(2d+1)\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor+|t|+2d$ and the linear complexity lower bounded by $\frac{q+1+2t-d-(d+1)\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor}{d+d\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor}$ where $\lfloor x\rfloor$ stands for the integer part of $x\in\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>The Generalization Error of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the method of gaps, a technique for deriving closed-form expressions in terms of information measures for the generalization error of supervised machine learning algorithms is introduced. The method relies on the notion of \emph{gaps}, which characterize the variation of the expected empirical risk (when either the model or dataset is kept fixed) with respect to changes in the probability measure on the varying parameter (either the dataset or the model, respectively). This distinction results in two classes of gaps: Algorithm-driven gaps (fixed dataset) and data-driven gaps (fixed model). In general, the method relies on two central observations: $(i)$~The generalization error is the expectation of an algorithm-driven gap or a data-driven gap. In the first case, the expectation is with respect to a measure on the datasets; and in the second case, with respect to a measure on the models. $(ii)$~Both, algorithm-driven gaps and data-driven gaps exhibit closed-form expressions in terms of relative entropies. In particular, algorithm-driven gaps involve a Gibbs probability measure on the set of models, which represents a supervised Gibbs algorithm. Alternatively, data-driven gaps involve a worst-case data-generating (WCDG) probability measure on the set of data points, which is also a Gibbs probability measure. Interestingly, such Gibbs measures, which are exogenous to the analysis of generalization, place both the supervised Gibbs algorithm and the WCDG probability measure as natural references for the analysis of supervised learning algorithms. All existing exact expressions for the generalization error of supervised machine learning algorithms can be obtained with the proposed method. Also, this method allows obtaining numerous new exact expressions, which allows establishing connections with other areas in statistics.</description>

      <title>Adversarial quantum channel discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantum channel discrimination in an adversarial setting, where the tester plays against an adversary. We show that in asymmetric hypothesis testing, the optimal type-II error exponent is precisely characterized by a new notion of quantum channel divergence (termed the minimum output channel divergence). This serves as a direct analog of the quantum Stein's lemma in this new framework, and complements previous studies on ``best-case'' channel discrimination, thereby providing a complete understanding of the ultimate limits of quantum channel discrimination. Notably, the optimal error exponent can be achieved by simple non-adaptive adversarial strategies, and despite the need for regularization, it remains efficiently computable and satisfies the strong converse property in general. Furthermore, we show that entropy accumulation, a powerful tool in quantum cryptography, can be reframed as an adversarial channel discrimination problem, establishing a new connection between quantum information theory and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Natural Image Classification via Quasi-Cyclic Graph Ensembles and Random-Bond Ising Models at the Nishimori Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern multi-class image classification relies on high-dimensional CNN feature vectors, which are computationally expensive and obscure the underlying data geometry. Conventional graph-based classifiers degrade on natural multi-class images because typical graphs fail to preserve separability on feature manifolds with complex topology. We address this with a physics-inspired pipeline frozen MobileNetV2 embeddings are treated as Ising spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph forming a Random Bond Ising Model. The system is tuned to its Nishimori temperature identified where the smallest Bethe-Hessian eigenvalue vanishes. Our method rests on two innovations: we prove a spectral-topological correspondence linking graph trapping sets to invariants via the Ihara-Bass zeta function removing these structures boosts top-1 accuracy over four-fold in multi-class settings; we develop a quadratic-Newton estimator for the Nishimori temperature converging in around 9 Arnoldi iterations for a 6-times speedup enabling spectral embedding on scales like ImageNet-100. The resulting graphs compress 1280-dimensional MobileNetV2 features to 32 dimensions for ImageNet10 and 64 for ImageNet-100 We achieve 98.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 84.92% on ImageNet-100 with a three-graph soft ensemble Versus MobileNetV2 our hard ensemble increases top-1 by 0.1% while cutting FLOPs by 2.67-times compared to ResNet50 the soft ensemble drops top1 by only 1.09% yet reduces FLOPs by 29-times. Novelty lies in (a) rigorously linking trapping sets to topological defects, (b) an efficient Nishimori temperature estimator and (c) demonstrating that topology-guided LDPC embedding produces highly compressed accurate classifiers for resource-constrained deployment</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social and psychological research. Among potential applications, LLMs can be used to generate, customise, or adapt measurement instruments. This study presents a preliminary investigation of AI-generated questionnaires by comparing two ChatGPT-based adaptations of the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) with the validated human-developed version. The AI instruments were designed with different levels of explicitness in content and instructions on construct facets, and their psychometric properties were assessed using a Bayesian Graded Response Model. Results show that although surface wording between AI and original items was similar, differences emerged in dimensionality and in the distribution of item and test information across latent traits. These findings illustrate the importance of applying statistical measures of accuracy to ensure the validity and interpretability of AI-driven tools.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality and Multiplicative Structures on Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21922</link>

Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\'e duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\'e duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=\Theta(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, \v{C}ech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.</description>
