      <title>FakeHunter: Multimodal Step-by-Step Reasoning for Explainable Video Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FakeHunter is a multimodal deepfake detection framework that combines memory-guided retrieval, chain-of-thought (Observation-Thought-Action) reasoning, and tool-augmented verification to provide accurate and interpretable video forensics. FakeHunter encodes visual content using CLIP and audio using CLAP, generating joint audio-visual embeddings that retrieve semantically similar real exemplars from a FAISS-indexed memory bank for contextual grounding. Guided by the retrieved context, the system iteratively reasons over evidence to localize manipulations and explain them. When confidence is low, it automatically invokes specialized tools-such as zoom-in image forensics or mel-spectrogram inspection-for fine-grained verification. Built on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, FakeHunter produces structured JSON verdicts that specify what was modified, where it occurs, and why it is judged fake. We also introduce X-AVFake, a benchmark comprising 5.7k+ manipulated and real videos (950+ min) annotated with manipulation type, region/entity, violated reasoning category, and free-form justification. On X-AVFake, FakeHunter achieves an accuracy of 34.75%, outperforming the vanilla Qwen2.5-Omni-7B by 16.87 percentage points and MiniCPM-2.6 by 25.56 percentage points. Ablation studies reveal that memory retrieval contributes a 7.75 percentage point gain, and tool-based inspection improves low-confidence cases to 46.50%. Despite its multi-stage design, the pipeline processes a 10-minute clip in 8 minutes on a single NVIDIA A800 (0.8x real-time) or 2 minutes on four GPUs (0.2x), demonstrating practical deployability.</description>

      <title>StarStream: Live Video Analytics over Space Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streaming videos from resource-constrained front-end devices over networks to resource-rich cloud servers has long been a common practice for surveillance and analytics. Most existing live video analytics (LVA) systems, however, have been built over terrestrial networks, limiting their applications during natural disasters and in remote areas that desperately call for real-time visual data delivery and scene analysis. With the recent advent of space networking, in particular, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations such as Starlink, high-speed truly global Internet access is becoming available and affordable. This paper examines the challenges and potentials of LVA over modern LEO satellite networking (LSN). Using Starlink as the testbed, we have carried out extensive in-the-wild measurements to gain insights into its achievable performance for LVA. The results reveal that the uplink bottleneck in today's LSN, together with the volatile network conditions, can significantly affect the service quality of LVA and necessitate prompt adaptation. We accordingly develop StarStream, a novel LSN-adaptive streaming framework for LVA. At its core, StarStream is empowered by a Transformer-based network performance predictor tailored for LSN and a content-aware configuration optimizer. We discuss a series of key design and implementation issues of StarStream and demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority through trace-driven experiments with real-world network and video processing data.</description>

      <title>OmniSense: Towards Edge-Assisted Online Analytics for 360-Degree Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more $360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential, advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing $360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$ videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI) prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames. Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/</description>

      <title>ShizhenGPT: Towards Multimodal LLMs for Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2) the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking, listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

      <title>Interpreting the linear structure of vision-language model embedding spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.</description>
