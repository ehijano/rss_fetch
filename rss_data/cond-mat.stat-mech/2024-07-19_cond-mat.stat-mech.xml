      <title>State-dependent mobility edge in kinetically constrained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network.</description>

      <title>Survival probabilities in the Sisyphus random walk model with absorbing traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Sisyphus random walk model, a discrete Markov chain in which the walkers may randomly return to their initial position $x_0$. In particular, we present a remarkably compact derivation of the time-dependent survival probability function $S(t;x_0)$ which characterizes the random walkers in the presence of an absorbing trap at the origin. The survival probabilities are expressed in a compact mathematical form in terms of the $x_0$-generalized Fibonacci-like numbers $G^{(x_0)}_t$. Interestingly, it is proved that, as opposed to the standard random walk model in which the survival probabilities depend linearly on the initial distance $x_0$ of the walkers from the trap and decay asymptotically as an inverse power of the time, in the Sisyphus random walk model the asymptotic survival probabilities decay exponentially in time and are characterized by a non-trivial (non-linear) dependence on the initial gap $x_0$ from the absorbing trap. We use the analytically derived results in order to analyze the underlying dynamics of the `survival-game', a highly risky investment strategy in which non-absorbed agents receive a reward $P(t)$ which gradually increases in time.</description>

      <title>The Dance of Odd-Diffusive Particles: A Fourier Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd-diffusive systems are characterized by transverse responses and exhibit unconventional behaviors in interacting systems. To address the dynamical interparticle rearrangements in a minimal system, we here exactly solve the problem of two hard disk-like interacting odd-diffusing particles. We calculate the probability density function (PDF) of the interacting particles in the Fourier-Laplace domain and find that oddness rotates all modes except the zeroth, resembling a ``mutual rolling'' of interacting odd particles. We show that only the first Fourier mode of the PDF, the polarization, enters the calculation of the force autocorrelation function (FACF) for generic systems with central-force interactions. An analysis of the polarization as a function of time reveals that the relative rotation angle between interacting particles overshoots before relaxation, thereby rationalizing the recently observed oscillating FACF in odd-diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Apparent delay of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quenched open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new intermediate regime in the quench time, $\tau_{q}$, separating the usual validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and its breakdown for rapid quenches in open systems under finite quench protocols. It manifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\tau_{q}$ as the system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is already terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This intermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the dissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This results in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase transition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order parameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke model and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic feature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator model. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near criticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further exacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we propose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the spatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for identifying the transition time.</description>

      <title>Dissipation at limited resolutions: Power law and detection of hidden dissipative scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems, in particular living organisms, are maintained by irreversible transformations of energy that drive diverse functions. Quantifying their irreversibility, as measured by energy dissipation, is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, existing techniques usually overlook experimental limitations, either by assuming full information or by employing a coarse-graining method that requires knowledge of the structure behind hidden degrees of freedom. Here, we study the inference of dissipation from finite-resolution measurements by employing a recently developed model-free estimator that considers both the sequence of coarse-grained transitions and the waiting time distributions: $\sigma_2=\sigma_2^\ell + \sigma_2^t$. The dominant term $\sigma_2^\ell$ originates from the sequence of observed transitions; we find that it scales with resolution following a power law. Comparing the scaling exponent with a previous estimator highlights the importance of accounting for flux correlations at lower resolutions. $\sigma_2^t$ comes from asymmetries in waiting time distributions, with its peak revealing characteristic scales of the underlying dissipative process. Alternatively, the characteristic scale can be detected in a crossover of the scaling of $\sigma_2^\ell$. This provides a novel perspective for extracting otherwise hidden characteristic dissipative scales directly from dissipation measurements. We illustrate these results in biochemical models as well as complex networks. Overall, this study highlights the significance of resolution considerations in nonequilibrium systems, providing insights into the interplay between experimental resolution, entropy production, and underlying complexity.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered, harmonic solid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered solid. The solid is modeled as a collection of randomly distributed particles connected by harmonic springs with strengths that depend on the interparticle distances, i.e the Euclidean random matrix model of Mezard et al. [Nucl. Phys. 559B, 689 (1999)]. The derivation of the theory combines two exact projection operator steps and a factorization approximation. Within our approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming transition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Statistical thermodynamics of the human brain activity, the Hagedorn temperature and the Zipf law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the brain spontaneously traverses through a very large number of states. Nevertheless, despite its relevance to understanding brain function, a formal description of this phenomenon is still lacking. To this end, we introduce a machine learning based method allowing for the determination of the probabilities of all possible states at a given coarse-graining, from which all the thermodynamics can be derived. This is a challenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of the statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear scaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first conjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which ordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes the existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range of brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we observe that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature. The presented approach is not only relevant to brain function but should be applicable for a wide variety of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting nonequilibrium phase transitions and strong symmetries for continuous measurement of collective observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative many-body quantum dynamics can feature strong symmetries which give rise to conserved quantities. We discuss here how a strong symmetry in conjunction with a nonequilibrium phase transition allows to devise a protocol for measuring collective many-body observables. To demonstrate this idea we consider a collective spin system whose constituents are governed by a dissipative dynamics that conserves the total angular momentum. We show that by continuously monitoring the system output the value of the total angular momentum can be inferred directly from the time-integrated emission signal, without the need of repeated projective measurements or reinitializations of the spins. This may offer a route towards the measurement of collective properties in qubit ensembles, with applications in quantum tomography, quantum computation and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Emulations in Classical Spin Models: Modularity and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of spin models intersects with complex systems, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, computational complexity and neural networks. Many ensuing applications rely on the fact that complicated spin models can be transformed to simpler ones. What is the structure of such transformations? Here, we provide a framework to study and construct emulations between spin models. A spin model is a set of spin systems, and emulations are efficiently computable simulations with arbitrary energy cut-off, where a source spin system simulates a target system if, below the cut-off, the target Hamiltonian is encoded in the source Hamiltonian. We prove that emulations preserve important properties, as they induce reductions between computational problems such as computing ground states, approximating partition functions and approximate sampling from Boltzmann distributions. Emulations are modular (they can be added, scaled and composed), and allow for universality, i.e. certain spin models have maximal reach. We prove that a spin model is universal if and only if it is scalable, closed and functional complete. Because the characterization is constructive, it provides a step-by-step guide to construct emulations. We prove that the 2d Ising model with fields is universal, for which we also provide two new crossing gadgets. Finally, we show that simulations can be computed by linear programs. While some ideas of this work are contained in [1], we provide new definitions and theorems. This framework provides a toolbox for applications involving emulations of spin models.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Strength of 2D Glasses Explored by Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strengths of glasses are intricately linked to their atomic-level heterogeneity. Atomistic simulations are frequently used to investigate the statistical physics of this relationship, compensating for the limited spatiotemporal resolution in experimental studies. However, theoretical insights are limited by the complexity of glass structures and the accuracy of the interatomic potentials used in simulations. Here, we investigate the strengths and fracture mechanisms of 2D silica, with all structural units accessible to direct experimental observation. We develop a neural network force field for fracture (NN-F$^{3}$) based on the deep potential-smooth edition (DeepPot-SE) framework. Representative atomic structures across crystals, nanocrystalline, paracrystalline, and continuous random network glasses are studied. We find that the virials or bond lengths control the initialization of bond-breaking events, creating nanoscale voids in the vitreous network. However, the voids do not necessarily lead to crack propagation due to a disorder-trapping effect, which is stronger than the lattice-trapping effect in a crystalline lattice and occurs over larger length and time scales. Fracture initiation proceeds with void growth and coalescence, and advances through a bridging mechanism. The fracture patterns are shaped by subsequent trapping and cleavage steps, often guided by voids forming ahead of the crack tip. These heterogeneous processes result in atomically smooth facets in crystalline regions and rough, amorphous edges in the glassy phase. These insights into 2D crystals and glasses, both sharing SiO$_{2}$ chemistry, highlight the pivotal role of atomic-level structures in determining fracture kinetics and path selection in materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion is a dissipative transport phenomenon ubiquitously present in nature. Its details can now be analysed with modern effective field theory (EFT) techniques that use the closed-time-path (or Schwinger-Keldysh) formalism. We discuss the structure of the diffusive effective action appropriate for the analysis of stochastic or thermal loop effects, responsible for the so-called long-time tails, to all orders. We also elucidate and prove a number of properties of the EFT and use the theory to establish the analytic structure of the $n$-loop contributions to diffusive retarded two-point functions. Our analysis confirms a previously proposed result by Delacr\'{e}taz that used microscopic conformal field theory arguments. Then, we analyse a number of implications of these loop corrections to the dispersion relations of the diffusive mode and new, gapped modes that appear when the EFT is treated as exact. Finally, we discuss certain features of an all-loop model of diffusion that only retains a special subset of $n$-loop `banana' diagrams.</description>

      <title>Decoding the interaction mediators from landscape-induced spatial patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between organisms are mediated by an intricate network of physico-chemical substances and other organisms. Understanding the dynamics of mediators and how they shape the population spatial distribution is key to predict ecological outcomes and how they would be transformed by changes in environmental constraints. However, due to the inherent complexity involved, this task is often unfeasible, from the empirical and theoretical perspectives. In this paper, we make progress in addressing this central issue, creating a bridge that provides a two-way connection between the features of the ensemble of underlying mediators and the wrinkles in the population density induced by a landscape defect (or spatial perturbation). The bridge is constructed by applying the Feynman-Vernon decomposition, which disentangles the influences among the focal population and the mediators in a compact way. This is achieved though an interaction kernel, which effectively incorporates the mediators' degrees of freedom, explaining the emergence of nonlocal influence between individuals, an ad hoc assumption in modeling population dynamics. Concrete examples are worked out and reveal the complexity behind a possible top-down inference procedure.</description>

      <title>Can dissipation induce a transition between many-body localized and thermal states?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in many-body systems. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we demonstrate the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Sound in a Tunable Fermi Fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory has been successful at the phenomenological description of the normal phase of many different Fermi systems. Using a dilute atomic Fermi fluid with tunable interactions, we investigate the microscopic basis of Landau's theory with a system describable from first principles. We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound, and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we observe the shape of the quasiparticle excitations directly from momentum-space tomography and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau's theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal sampling of dynamical large deviations in two dimensions via tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) to calculate the large deviations (LD) statistics of the dynamical activity of the two dimensional East model, and the two dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) with open boundaries, in lattices of up to 40x40 sites. We show that at long-times both models have phase transitions between active and inactive dynamical phases. For the 2D East model we find that this trajectory transition is of the first-order, while for the SSEP we find indications of a second order transition. We then show how the PEPS can be used to implement a trajectory sampling scheme capable of directly accessing rare trajectories. We also discuss how the methods described here can be extended to study rare events at finite times.</description>

      <title>Dynamical heterogeneity and large deviations in the open quantum East glass model from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free learning of measurement-induced quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address how one can empirically infer properties of quantum states generated by dynamics involving measurements. Our focus is on many-body settings where the number of measurements is extensive, making brute-force approaches based on postselection intractable due to their exponential sample complexity. We introduce a general-purpose scheme that can be used to infer any property of the post-measurement ensemble of states (e.g. the average entanglement entropy, or frame potential) using a scalable number of experimental repetitions. We first identify a general class of estimable properties that can be directly extracted from experimental data. Then, based on empirical observations of such quantities, we show how one can indirectly infer information about any particular given non-estimable quantity of interest through classical post-processing. Our approach is based on an optimization task, where one asks what are the minimum and maximum values that the desired quantity could possibly take, while ensuring consistency with observations. The true value of this quantity must then lie within a feasible range between these extrema, resulting in two-sided bounds. Narrow feasible ranges can be obtained by using a classical simulation of the device to determine which estimable properties one should measure. Even in cases where this simulation is inaccurate, unambiguous information about the true value of a given quantity realised on the quantum device can be learned. As an immediate application, we show that our method can be used to verify the emergence of quantum state designs in experiments. We identify some fundamental obstructions that in some cases prevent sharp knowledge of a given quantity from being inferred, and discuss what can be learned in cases where classical simulation is too computationally demanding to be feasible.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description and macroscopic limit of swarming dynamics with continuous leader-follower transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a kinetic description of swarming particle dynamics in an interacting multi-agent system featuring emerging leaders and followers. Agents are classically characterized by their position and velocity plus a continuous parameter quantifying their degree of leadership. The microscopic processes ruling the change of velocity and degree of leadership are independent, non-conservative and non-local in the physical space, so as to account for long-range interactions. Out of the kinetic description, we obtain then a macroscopic model under a hydrodynamic limit reminiscent of that used to tackle the hydrodynamics of weakly dissipative granular gases, thus relying in particular on a regime of small non-conservative and short-range interactions. Numerical simulations in one- and two-dimensional domains show that the limiting macroscopic model is consistent with the original particle dynamics and furthermore can reproduce classical emerging patterns typically observed in swarms.</description>

      <title>Hayden-Preskill recovery in chaotic and integrable unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter-Toda spectral duality and quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hofstadter model allows to describe and understand several phenomena in condensed matter such as the quantum Hall effect, Anderson localization, charge pumping, and flat-bands in quasiperiodic structures, and is a rare example of fractality in the quantum world. An apparently unrelated system, the relativistic Toda lattice, has been extensively studied in the context of complex nonlinear dynamics, and more recently for its connection to supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and topological string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-energy physics. Here we discuss a recently discovered spectral relationship between the Hofstadter model and the relativistic Toda lattice which has been later conjectured to be related to the Langlands duality of quantum groups. Moreover, by employing similarity transformations compatible with the quantum group structure, we establish a formula parametrizing the energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials. The main tools used are the spectral duality of tridiagonal matrices and the representation theory of the elementary quantum group.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of ($\mathbf{2+1}$)-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopole Current Networks in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Bose Machine achieves both generalization and adversarial robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinct from human cognitive processing, deep neural networks trained by backpropagation can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. To design a semantically meaningful representation learning, we discard backpropagation, and instead, propose a local contrastive learning, where the representation for the inputs bearing the same label shrink (akin to boson) in hidden layers, while those of different labels repel (akin to fermion). This layer-wise learning is local in nature, being biological plausible. A statistical mechanics analysis shows that the target fermion-pair-distance is a key parameter. Moreover, the application of this local contrastive learning to MNIST benchmark dataset demonstrates that the adversarial vulnerability of standard perceptron can be greatly mitigated by tuning the target distance, i.e., controlling the geometric separation of prototype manifolds.</description>
