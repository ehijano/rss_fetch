      <title>Topological Sequence Entropy of co-Induced Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete, countably infinite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. If $H$ acts continuously on a compact metric space $X$, then we can induce a continuous action of $G$ on $\prod_{H\backslash G}X$ where $H\backslash G$ is the collection of right-cosets of $H$ in $G$. This process is known as the co-induction. In this article, we will calculate the maximal pattern entropy of the co-induction. If $[G:H] &lt; +\infty$ we will show that the $H$ action is null if and only if the co-induced action of $G$ is null. Also, we will discuss an example where $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ with finite index where the maximal pattern entropy of the $H$ action is equal to the co-induced action of $G$. If $[G:H] = +\infty$ we will show that the maximal pattern entropy of the co-induction is always $+\infty$ given the $H$-system is not trivial.</description>

      <title>Entropy for compact operators and results on entropy and specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the specification property implies infinite topological entropy for operators acting on infinite dimensional $F$-spaces. Furthermore, we establish compact operators acting on Banach spaces exhibit finite entropy and the entropy depends exclusively on the operator's point spectrum. Additionally, we prove that the variational principle does not hold for compact operators acting on Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>A first engineering principles model for dynamical simulation of cement pyro-process cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a cyclone model for dynamical simulations in the pyro-process of cement production. The model is given as an index-1 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model based on first engineering principle. Using a systematic approach, the model integrates cyclone geometry, thermo-physical aspects, stoichiometry and kinetics, mass and energy balances, and algebraic equations for volume and internal energy.
  The paper provides simulation results that fit expected dynamics.
  The cyclone model is part of an overall model for dynamical simulations of the pyro-process in a cement plant. This model can be used in the design of control and optimization systems to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emission.</description>

      <title>Averaging theory and catastrophes: The persistence of bifurcations under time-varying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a dynamical system is subject to a periodic perturbation, the averaging method can be applied to obtain an autonomous leading order `guiding system', placing the time dependence at higher orders. Recent research focused on investigating invariant structures in non-autonomous differential systems arising from hyperbolic structures in the guiding system, such as periodic orbits and invariant tori. The effect that bifurcations in the guiding system have on the original non-autonomous one has also been recently explored. This paper extends the study by providing a broader description of the dynamics that can emerge from non-hyperbolic structures of the guiding system. Specifically, we prove here that $K$-universal bifurcations in the guiding system persist in the original non-autonomous one, while non-versal bifurcations, such as the transcritical and pitchfork, do not, being instead perturbed into stable bifurcation families. We illustrate the results on examples of a fold, a transcritical, a pitchfork, and a saddle-focus. By applying these results to the physical scenario of systems with time-varying parameters, we show that the average parameter value becomes a bifurcation parameter of the averaged system.</description>

      <title>A Ruelle operator for holomorphic correspondences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11085v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the ideas of certain notions that one studies in thermodynamic formalism of maps to the context when the dynamics in the phase space evolves by complex holomorphic correspondences. Towards that end, we define the topological entropy of holomorphic correspondences using spanning sets. We then, define the pressure of a real-valued continuous function defined on the Riemann sphere and investigate the Ruelle operator with respect to the H\"{o}lder continuous function, however restricted on the support of the Dinh-Sibony measure.</description>

      <title>Katok's entropy conjecture near real and complex hyperbolic metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, given a real or complex hyperbolic metric $g_0$ on a closed manifold $M$ of dimension $n\geq 3$, there exists a neighborhood $\mathcal U$ of $g_0$ in the space of negatively curved metrics such that for any $g\in \mathcal U$, the topological entropy and Liouville entropy of $g$ coincide if and only if $g$ and $g_0$ are homothetic. This provides a partial answer to Katok's entropy rigidity conjecture. As a direct consequence of our theorem, we obtain a local rigidity result of the hyperbolic rank near complex hyperbolic metrics.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Spacial Studies of Infectious Diseases: Mathematical Models and Numerical Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SIR model is a classical model characterizing the spreading of infectious diseases. This model describes the time-dependent quantity changes among Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered groups. By introducing space-depend effects such as diffusion and creation in addition to the SIR model, the Fisher's model is in fact a more advanced and comprehensive model. However, the Fisher's model is much less popular than the SIR model in simulating infectious disease numerically due to the difficulties from the parameter selection, the involvement of 2-d/3-d spacial effects, the configuration of the boundary conditions, etc.
  This paper aim to address these issues by providing numerical algorithms involving space and time finite difference schemes and iterative methods, and its open-source Python code for solving the Fisher's model. This 2-D Fisher's solver is second order in space and up to the second order in time, which is rigorously verified using test cases with analytical solutions. Numerical algorithms such as SOR, implicit Euler, Staggered Crank-Nicolson, and ADI are combined to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the solver. It can handle various boundary conditions subject to different physical descriptions. In addition, real-world data of Covid-19 are used by the model to demonstrate its practical usage in providing prediction and inferences.</description>

      <title>Consensus in Models for Opinion Dynamics with Generalized-Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest is growing in social learning models where users share opinions and adjust their beliefs in response to others. This paper introduces generalized-bias opinion models, an extension of the DeGroot model, that captures a broader range of cognitive biases. These models can capture, among others, dynamic (changing) influences as well as ingroup favoritism and out-group hostility, a bias where agents may react differently to opinions from members of their own group compared to those from outside. The reactions are formalized as arbitrary functions that depend, not only on opinion difference, but also on the particular opinions of the individuals interacting. Under certain reasonable conditions, all agents (despite their biases) will converge to a consensus if the influence graph is strongly connected, as in the original DeGroot model. The proposed approach combines different biases, providing deeper insights into the mechanics of opinion dynamics and influence within social networks.</description>

      <title>Spectral localization estimates for abstract linear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation properties of abstract linear Schr\"odinger equations of the form $i\partial_t\psi = H_0\psi+V(t)\psi$, where $H_0$ is a self-adjoint operator and $V(t)$ a time-dependent potential. We present explicit sufficient conditions ensuring that if the initial state $\psi_0$ has spectral support in $(-\infty,0]$ with respect to a reference self-adjoint operator $\phi$, then, for some $c&gt;0$ independent of $\psi_0$ and all $t\ne0$, the solution $\psi_t$ remains spectrally supported in $(-\infty,c|t|]$ with respect to $\phi$, up to an $O(|t|^{-n})$ remainder in norm. The main condition is that the multiple commutators of $H_0$ and $\phi$ are uniformly bounded in operator norm up to the $(n+1)$-th order. We then apply the abstract theory to a class of nonlocal Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$, proving that any solution with compactly supported initial state remains approximately supported, up to a polynomially suppressed tail in $L^2$-norm, inside a linearly spreading region around the initial support for all $t\ne0$.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study notions of hyperuniformity for invariant locally square-integrable point processes in regular trees. We show that such point processes are never geometrically hyperuniform, and if the diffraction measure has support in the complementary series then the process is geometrically hyperfluctuating along all subsequences of radii. A definition of spectral hyperuniformity and stealth of a point process is given in terms of vanishing of the complementary series diffraction and sub-Poissonian decay of the principal series diffraction near the endpoints of the principal spectrum. Our main contribution is providing examples of stealthy invariant random lattice orbits in trees whose number variance grows strictly slower than the volume along some unbounded sequence of radii. These random lattice orbits are constructed from the fundamental groups of complete graphs and the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Spatio-Temporal Decomposition of Control-Related Sum-of-Squares Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for calculating the Region of Attraction (ROA) of nonlinear dynamical systems, both with and without control. The ROA is determined by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite programs (SDPs) defined on a splitting of the time and state space. Previous works demonstrated that this splitting could significantly enhance approximation accuracy, although the improvement was highly dependent on the ad-hoc selection of split locations. In this work, we eliminate the need for this ad-hoc selection by introducing an optimization-based method that performs the splits through conic differentiation of the underlying semidefinite programming problem. We provide the differentiability conditions for the split ROA problem, prove the absence of a duality gap, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Dynamical Northcott and Bogomolov Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.07907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the dynamical Northcott property for polarized endomorphisms of a projective variety over a function field $\mathbf{K}$ of characteristic zero, and we relate this property to the notion of stability in complex dynamics. This extends previous results of Benedetto, Baker and DeMarco in dimension $1$, and of Chatzidakis-Hrushovski in higher dimension. Our proof uses complex dynamics arguments and does not rely on the previous ones.
  We first show that, when $\mathbf{K}$ is the field of rational functions of a normal complex projective variety, the canonical height of a subvariety is the mass of an appropriate bifurcation current and that a marked point is stable if and only if its canonical height is zero. We then establish the geometric dynamical Northcott property characterizing points of height zero in this setting, using a similarity argument. Moving from points to subvarieties, we propose, for polarized endomorphisms, a dynamical version of the geometric Bogomolov conjecture, recently proved by Cantat, Gao, Habegger, and Xie in the original setting of abelian varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A translation surface is given by polygons in the plane, with sides identified by translations to create a closed Riemann surface with a flat structure away from finitely many singular points. Understanding geodesic flow on a surface involves understanding saddle connections. Saddle connections are the geodesics starting and ending at these singular points and are associated to a discrete subset of the plane. To measure the behavior of saddle connections of length at most $R$, we obtain precise decay rates as $R\to \infty$ for the difference in angle between two almost horizontal saddle connections.</description>

      <title>Testing topological conjugacy of time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a problem of testing, from a finite sample, a topological conjugacy of two dynamical systems $(X,f)$ and $(Y,g)$. More precisely, given $x_1,\ldots, x_n \subset X$ and $y_1,\ldots,y_n \subset Y$ such that $x_{i+1} = f(x_i)$ and $y_{i+1} = g(y_i)$ as well as $h: X \rightarrow Y$, we deliver a number of tests to check if $f$ and $g$ are topologically conjugated via $h$. The values of the tests are close to zero for conjugated systems and large for systems that are not conjugated. Convergence of the test values, in case when sample size goes to infinity, is established. A number of numerical examples indicating scalability and robustness of the methods are given. In addition, we show how the presented method specialize to a test of sufficient embedding dimension in Takens' embedding theorem. Our methods also apply to the situation when we are given two observables of deterministic processes, of a form of one or higher dimensional time-series. In this case, their similarity can be accessed by comparing the dynamics of their Takens' reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem for Filippov vector fields on 2-dimensional compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem relates the Euler characteristic of a 2-dimensional compact manifold to the local behavior of smooth vector fields defined on it. However, despite the importance of Filippov vector fields, concerning both their theoretical and applied aspects, until now, it was not known whether this theorem extends to Filippov vector fields. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem applies to Filippov vector fields defined on 2-dimensional compact manifolds with smooth switching manifolds. As a result, we establish a variant of the Hairy Ball Theorem, asserting that "any Filippov vector field on a sphere with smooth switching manifolds must have at least one singularity (in the Filippov sense) with positive index". This extension is achieved by introducing a new index definition that includes the singularities of Filippov vector fields, such as pseudo-equilibria and tangential singularities. Our work extends the classical index definition for singularities of smooth vector fields to encompass those of Filippov vector fields with smooth switching manifolds. This extension is based on an invariance property under a regularization process, allowing us to establish all classical index properties. We also compute the indices of all generic $\Sigma$-singularities and some codimension-1 $\Sigma$-singularities, including fold-fold tangential singularities, regular-cusp tangential singularities, and saddle-node pseudo-equilibria.</description>

      <title>Pitchfork bifurcation and heteroclinic connections in the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for the complete analysis of the dynamics of dissipative Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) undergoing a pitchfork bifurcation. We apply our technique to the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky PDE on the line to obtain a computer-assisted proof of the creation of two symmetric branches of non-symmetric fixed points and heteroclinic connections between the symmetric fixed point and the new ones. The range of parameters is given explicitly and is large enough to allow for the rigorous continuation of the fixed points and heteroclinic connections created during the bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Local mean dimension theory for sofic group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a local perspective, we introduce \textit{mean dimension pairs} and give sufficient conditions of when every non-trivial factor of a continuous group action of a sofic group $G$ has positive mean dimension. In addition we show that the mean dimension map is Borel, and that the set of subshifts with completely positive mean dimension of $[0,1]^G$, the full $G$-shift on the interval, is a complete coanalytic set in the set of all subshifts (hence not Borel). Our results are new even when the acting group is $\Z$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative uniform exponential acceleration of averages along decaying waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, utilizing a specific exponential weighting function, we investigate the uniform exponential convergence of weighted Birkhoff averages along decaying waves and delve into several related variants. A key distinction from traditional scenarios is evident here: despite reduced regularity in observables, our method still maintains exponential convergence. In particular, we develop new techniques that yield very precise rates of exponential convergence, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this innovative approach extends to quantitative analyses involving different weighting functions employed by others, surpassing the limitations inherent in prior research. It also enhances the exponential convergence rates of weighted Birkhoff averages along quasi-periodic orbits via analytic observables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the uniform exponential acceleration beyond averages along quasi-periodic or almost periodic orbits, particularly from a quantitative perspective.</description>

      <title>Global stability for McKean-Vlasov equations on large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mean-field dynamics of stochastic McKean differential equations with heterogeneous particle interactions described by large network structures. To express a wide range of graphs, from dense to sparse structures, we incorporate the recently developed graph limit theory of graphops into the limiting McKean--Vlasov equations. Global stability of the splay steady state is proven via a generalized entropy method, leading to explicit graph-structure dependent decay rates. We highlight the robustness of the entropy approach by extending the results to the closely related Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with intrinsic frequency distribution. We also present central examples of random graphs, such as power law graphs and the spherical graphop, and analyze the limitations of the applied methodology.</description>

      <title>The Maslov index, degenerate crossings and the stability of pulse solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the scalar Swift-Hohenberg equation with quadratic-cubic nonlinearity, it is known that symmetric pulse solutions exist for certain parameter regions. In this paper we develop a method to determine the spectral stability of these solutions by associating a Maslov index to them. This requires extending the method of computing the Maslov index introduced by Robbin and Salamon [Topology 32, no.4 (1993): 827-844] to so-called degenerate crossings. We extend their formulation of the Maslov index to degenerate crossings of general order in the case where the intersection is fully degenerate, meaning that if the dimension of the intersection is k, then each of the k crossings is a degenerate one. We then argue that, in this case, this index coincides with the number of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to compute the Maslov index associated to symmetric pulse solutions. Finally, we consider several solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and use our method to characterize their stability.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degree and its application to Zariski dense orbit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a quasi-projective variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, there is a point whose $f$-orbit is well-defined and its arithmetic degree is arbitrary close to the first dynamical degree of $f$. As an application, we prove that Zariski dense orbit conjecture holds for a birational map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that the first dynamical degree is strictly larger than the third dynamical degree. In particular, the conjecture holds for birational maps on threefolds with first dynamical degree larger than $1$.</description>
