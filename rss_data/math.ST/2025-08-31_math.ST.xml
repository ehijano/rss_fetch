      <title>Practically significant change points in high dimension -- measuring signal strength pro active component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the change point testing problem for high-dimensional time series. Unlike conventional approaches, where one tests whether the difference $\delta$ of the mean vectors before and after the change point is equal to zero, we argue that the consideration of the null hypothesis $H_0:\|\delta\|\le\Delta$, for some norm $\|\cdot\|$ and a threshold $\Delta&gt;0$, is better suited. By the formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis, the change point testing problem becomes significantly more challenging. We develop pivotal inference for testing hypotheses of this type in the setting of high-dimensional time series, first, measuring deviations from the null vector by the $\ell_2$-norm $\|\cdot\|_2$ normalized by the dimension. Second, by measuring deviations using a sparsity adjusted $\ell_2$-"norm" $\|\cdot \|_2/\sqrt{\|\cdot\|_0} $, where $\|\cdot\|_0$ denotes the $\ell_0$-"norm," we propose a pivotal test procedure which intrinsically adapts to sparse alternatives in a data-driven way by pivotally estimating the set of nonzero entries of the vector $\delta$. To establish the statistical validity of our approach, we derive tail bounds of certain classes of distributions that frequently appear as limiting distributions of self-normalized statistics. As a theoretical foundation for all results, we develop a general weak invariance principle for the partial sum process $X_1^\top\xi +\cdots +X_{\lfloor\lambda n\rfloor}^\top\xi$ for a time series $(X_j)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and a contrast vector $\xi\in\mathbb{R}^p$ under increasing dimension $p$, which is of independent interest. Finally, we investigate the finite sample properties of the tests by means of a simulation study and illustrate its application in a data example.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic equivalence of non-parametric regression on spherical $t$-designs and Gaussian white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of spherical $t$-designs has attracted interest in various areas of mathematics over the past decades. In this work, we consider spherical $t$-designs as the set of sampling points in non-parametric regression on spheres of arbitrary dimension. We show that the fixed design regression experiments defined this way are asymptotically equivalent, in the sense of Le Cam, to a sequence of Gaussian white noise experiments as the sample size tends to infinity. More precisely, global asymptotic equivalence is established for both Sobolev and Besov balls on the sphere. These results provide further support for the use of spherical $t$-designs as sampling points in non-parametric regression with spherical regressors.</description>

      <title>Detection of collective and point anomalies at the presence of trend and seasonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is a challenging task with broad relevance in many applications. Existing methods work effectively only under idealized conditions, typically focusing on point anomalies or assuming a constant baseline. Our approach overcomes these limitations by detecting both collective and point anomalies, while allowing for polynomial trends and seasonal patterns. We establish statistical theory demonstrating that our method accurately decomposes the time series into anomaly, trend, seasonality, and a remainder component. We further show that it estimates the number of anomalies consistently and their locations with minimal error. Simulation studies confirm its strong detection performance with finite samples, and an application to energy price data illustrates its practical utility. An R package is available on request.</description>

      <title>Remarks on stochastic cloning and delayed-state filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements, demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Relative compactness of It\^o integrals on the M1 Skorokhod space with identification of limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish general results for weak relative compactness of sequences of It\^o integrals with respect to Skorohod's functional M1 topology, under general conditions. Moreover, we are able to explicitly characterise the form of the limit points of all convergent subsequences. This result closes a longstanding gap in the literature, where weak relative compactness had previously only been shown under the significantly more restrictive J1 topology, or the S topology which is too coarse to preserve continuity for most common functionals.</description>

      <title>Uniform Estimation and Inference for Nonparametric Partitioning-Based M-Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents uniform estimation and inference theory for a large class of nonparametric partitioning-based M-estimators. The main theoretical results include: (i) uniform consistency for convex and non-convex objective functions; (ii) rate-optimal uniform Bahadur representations; (iii) rate-optimal uniform (and mean square) convergence rates; (iv) valid strong approximations and feasible uniform inference methods; and (v) extensions to functional transformations of underlying estimators. Uniformity is established over both the evaluation point of the nonparametric functional parameter and a Euclidean parameter indexing the class of loss functions. The results also account explicitly for the smoothness degree of the loss function (if any), and allow for a possibly non-identity (inverse) link function. We illustrate the theoretical and methodological results in four examples: quantile regression, distribution regression, $L_p$ regression, and Logistic regression. Many other possibly non-smooth, nonlinear, generalized, robust M-estimation settings are covered by our results. We provide detailed comparisons with the existing literature and demonstrate substantive improvements: we achieve the best (in some cases optimal) known results under improved (in some cases minimal) requirements in terms of regularity conditions and side rate restrictions. The supplemental appendix reports complementary technical results that may be of independent interest, including a novel uniform strong approximation result based on Yurinskii's coupling.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises Phenomenon via Isotonized Posterior in Wicksell's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for nonparametric estimation in Wicksell's problem. This has important applications in astronomy for estimating the distribution of the positions of the stars in a galaxy given projected stellar positions and in materials science to determine the 3D microstructure of a material, using its 2D cross sections. We deviate from the classical Bayesian nonparametric approach, which would place a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior on the distribution function of the unobservables, by directly placing a DP prior on the distribution function of the observables. Our method offers computational simplicity due to the conjugacy of the posterior and allows for asymptotically efficient estimation by projecting the posterior onto the \( \mathbb{L}_2 \) subspace of increasing, right-continuous functions. Indeed, the resulting Isotonized Inverse Posterior (IIP) satisfies a Bernstein--von Mises (BvM) phenomenon with minimax asymptotic variance \( g_0(x)/2\gamma \), where \( \gamma &gt; 1/2 \) reflects the degree of H\"older continuity of the true cdf at \( x \). Since the IIP gives automatic uncertainty quantification, it eliminates the need to estimate \( \gamma \). Our results provide the first semiparametric Bernstein--von Mises theorem for projection-based posteriors with a DP prior in inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Conditionally specified graphical modeling of stationary multivariate time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical models are ubiquitous for summarizing conditional relations in multivariate data. In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model (CEStGM). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</description>

      <title>Dual Induction CLT for High-dimensional m-dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel and sharp high-dimensional Berry--Esseen bounds for the sum of $m$-dependent random vectors over the class of hyper-rectangles exhibiting only a poly-logarithmic dependence in the dimension. Our results hold under minimal assumptions, such as non-degenerate covariances and finite third moments, and exhibit an optimal sample complexity of order $m^{(q-1)/(q-2)}/\sqrt{n}$. Aside from logarithmic terms, the resulting rates match the optimal rates established in the univariate case. When specialized to the sums of independent non-degenerate random vectors, our results produce sharp and, in some cases, optimal rates under the weakest possible conditions. We develop a novel inductive relationship between anti-concentration inequalities and Berry--Esseen bounds inspired by the classical Lindeberg swapping method and the concentration inequality approach for dependent data that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>TorchCP: A Python Library for Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical framework that generates prediction intervals or sets with guaranteed coverage probability. While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale DL scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into deep learning techniques, including DNN-based classifier/regressor, GNN, and LLM. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</description>

      <title>On the Palm distribution of superposition of point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Palm distributions are critical in the study of point processes. In the present paper we focus on a point process $\Phi$ defined as the superposition, i.e., sum, of two independent point processes, say $\Phi = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2$, and we characterize its Palm distribution. In particular, we show that the Palm distribution of $\Phi$ admits a simple mixture representation depending only on the Palm distribution of $\Phi_j$, as $j=1, 2$, and the associated moment measures. Extensions to the superposition of multiple point processes, and higher order Palm distributions, are treated analogously.</description>
