      <title>On the feasibility of laser satellite communications from the Martian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free space optical (FSO) communication using lasers is a rapidly developing field in telecommunications that can offer advantages over traditional radio frequency technology. For example, optical laser links may allow transmissions at far higher data rates, require less operating power and smaller systems and have a smaller risk of interception. In recent years, FSO laser links have been demonstrated, tested or integrated in a range of environments and scenarios. These include FSO links for terrestrial communication, between ground stations and cube-sats in low Earth orbit, between ground and satellite in lunar orbit, as part of scientific or commercial space relay networks, and deep space communications beyond the moon. The possibility of FSO links from and to the surface of Mars could be a natural extension of these developments. In this paper we evaluate some effects of the Martian atmosphere on the propagation of optical communication links, with an emphasis on the impact of dust on the total link budget. We use the output of the Mars Climate Database to generate maps of the dust optical depth for a standard Mars climatology, as well as for a warm (dusty) atmosphere. These dust optical depths are then extrapolated to a wavelength of 1.55 um, and translated into total slant path optical depths to calculate link budgets and availability statistics for a link between the surface and a satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit. The outcomes of this study are relevant to potential future missions to Mars that may require laser communications to or from its surface. For example, the results could be used to constrain the design of communication terminals suitable to the Mars environment, or to assess the link performance as a function of ground station location.</description>

      <title>On Validating Angular Power Spectral Models for the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Without Distributional Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that estimators of the angular power spectrum commonly used for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) lack a closed-form analytical expression for the likelihood function and, typically, cannot be accurately approximated by a Gaussian likelihood. Nevertheless, a robust statistical analysis can be performed by extending the framework outlined in \cite{PRL} to enable the estimation and testing of angular power spectral models for the SGWB without specifying distributional assumptions. Here, the technical aspects of the method are discussed in detail. Moreover, a new, consistent estimator for the covariance of the angular power spectrum is derived. The proposed approach is applied to data from the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.</description>

      <title>Fried Parameter Estimation from Single Wavefront Sensor Image with Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument control.</description>

      <title>Venus and Bright Planets Through a Large-Scale Camera Obscura: Optical and Mechanical Issues of Conducting the Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article describes observations of the crescent of Venus and other bright planets using a large camera obscura. The goal of the article is to demonstrate that these observations can be successfully performed. Achieving positive results depends on solving several key problems. The most significant of these is the difficulty of perceiving the extremely faint light of a planet on the camera obscura screen. This issue is resolved through the use of special directional screens. Two main types (translucent and reflective) are described in the article. The construction of a so-called ``artificial Venus'', designed to test directional screens and determine the average sensitivity of human vision, is also presented. \\ Other serious challenges include aiming the camera obscura at the celestial object and compensating for Earth's rotation. One of the methods discussed involves the use of a flat intermediate mirror and a special mount for its guidance.\\ The objective of the paper is fulfilled through the presentation of both visual and photographic observation results. In addition to Venus's crescent, observations of the Saturn's rings are also presented. The proposed design of the camera obscura, which incorporates a specialized projection system, enables the separation of its two functions: directing light from objects and focusing its energy. The elements performing these tasks are fully scalable. This can be used in the construction of modern telescopes. The article also comments on the possibility of observing the phases of Venus in the distant past and the important consequences resulting from this.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Image Similarity Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have created a large database of similarity information between sub-regions of Hubble Space Telescope images. These data can be used to assess the accuracy of image search algorithms based on computer vision methods. The images were compared by humans in a citizen science project, where they were asked to select similar images from a comparison sample. We utilized the Amazon Mechanical Turk system to pay our reviewers a fair wage for their work. Nearly 850,000 comparison measurements have been analyzed to construct a similarity distance matrix between all the pairs of images. We describe the algorithm used to extract a robust distance matrix from the (sometimes noisy) user reviews. The results are very impressive: the data capture similarity between images based on morphology, texture, and other details that are sometimes difficult even to describe in words (e.g., dusty absorption bands with sharp edges). The collective visual wisdom of our citizen scientists matches the accuracy of the trained eye, with even subtle differences among images faithfully reflected in the distances.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cloud Matching in CO and Dust in M33 I. High-Resolution Hydrogen Column Density Maps from Herschel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03601v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular hydrogen distribution in the galaxy M33 by introducing novel methods for generating high angular resolution (18.2$''$, equivalent to 75 pc) column density maps of molecular hydrogen ($N_{\rm H_2}$). M33 is a local group galaxy that has been observed with Herschel in the far-infrared wavelength range from 70 to 500 $\mu$m. Previous studies have presented total hydrogen column density maps ($N_{\rm H}$), using these FIR data (partly combined with mid-IR maps), employing various methods. We first performed a spectral energy distribution fit to the 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m continuum data obtain $N_{\rm H}$, using a technique similar to one previously reported in the literature. We also use a second method which involves translating only the 250 $\mu$m map into a $N_{\rm H}$ map at the same angular resolution. An $N_{\rm H_2}$ map via each method is then obtained by subtracting the HI component. Distinguishing our study from previous ones, we adopt a more versatile approach by considering a variable emissivity index, $\beta$ and dust absorption coefficient, $\kappa_0$. This choice enables us to construct a $\kappa_0$ map, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of our investigation of the hydrogen column density. We address the inherent biases and challenges within both methods (which give similar results) and compare them with existing maps available in the literature. Moreover, we calculate a map of the carbon monoxide CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_\mathrm{CO}$ factor), which shows a strong dispersion around an average value of $1.8\times10^{20}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}/(K\,km\,s^{-1})}$ throughout the disk. We obtain column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) from the $N_{\rm H}$, $N_{\rm H_2}$, and $N_{HI}$ maps and discuss their shape.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C\,{\tiny II}] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shells in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H\,{\tiny II} region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H\,{\tiny II} regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C\,{\tiny II}] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H\,{\tiny II} region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C\,{\tiny II}] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C\,{\tiny II}] emission and a low ratio of [C\,{\tiny II}] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C\,{\tiny II}] flux and find a linear correlation between [C\,{\tiny II}] and FIR without a [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit found in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gravitational wave and ultra-light dark matter detection with binary resonances beyond the secular approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision observations of orbital systems have recently emerged as a promising new means of detecting gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter, offering sensitivity in new regimes with significant discovery potential. These searches rely critically on precise modeling of the dynamical effects of these signals on the observed system; however, previous analyses have mainly only relied on the secularly-averaged part of the response. We introduce here a fundamentally different approach that allows for a fully time-resolved description of the effects of oscillatory metric perturbations on orbital dynamics. We find that gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter can induce large oscillations in the orbital parameters of realistic binaries, enhancing the sensitivity to such signals by orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Line-of-Sight Velocity Projection Impact on the Local Group Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of the Local Group (LG), comprising the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31), and their satellites, is crucial for validating galaxy formation and cosmological models. Traditional virial mass estimates, which rely on line-of-sight (LoS) velocities and simplified infall assumptions, are prone to systematic biases due to unobserved velocity components and anisotropic kinematics. Using the TNG cosmological simulation, we examine two limiting cases: the \underline{minor infall} model -- ignoring perpendicular velocities to the LoS directions) and the \underline{major infall} model -- assuming purely radial motion towards the Center of Mass (CoM). Our simulations demonstrate that geometric corrections are vital: the minor-infall model underestimates the true mass, while the major-infall model overestimates it. By applying these calibrated corrections to observed dwarf galaxy kinematics within 1 Mpc of the LG's CoM, we derive a refined LG mass of $M_{\mathrm{LG}} = (2.99 \pm 0.60) \times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. This finding aligns with predictions from the $\Lambda$CDM model, timing arguments, and independent mass estimates, resolving previous discrepancies. Our analysis highlights the importance of correcting for velocity anisotropy and offers a robust framework for dynamical mass estimation in galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion-Based Retrieval of Atmospheric CO2 from Earth Observing Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A Search for Planet Nine with IRAS and AKARI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outer solar system is theoretically predicted to harbour an undiscovered planet, often referred to as P9. Simulations suggest that its gravitational influence could explain the unusual clustering of minor bodies in the Kuiper Belt. However, no observational evidence for P9 has been found so far, as its predicted orbit lies far beyond Neptune, where it reflects only a faint amount of Sunlight. This work aims to find P9 candidates by taking advantage of two far-infrared all-sky surveys, which are IRAS and AKARI. The epochs of these two surveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect the ~3'/year orbital motion of P9. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point source list for our P9 search - AKARI Monthly Unconfirmed Source List, which includes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after months. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI detections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and orbital motion of P9 by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature to ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and flux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the catalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs whose angular separations were limited between 42' and 69.6', corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 - 700 AU and the mass range of 7 - 17 Earth masses. There are 13 pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image inspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent from the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa. However, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit of this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations, which will determine the Keplerian motion of our candidate.</description>

      <title>Model Choice Matters for Age Inference on the Red Giant Branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic archaeology relies on accurate stellar parameters to reconstruct the galaxy's history, including information on stellar ages. While the precision of data has improved significantly in recent years, stellar models used for age inference have not improved at a similar rate. In fact, different models yield notably different age predictions for the same observational data. In this paper, we assess the difference in age predictions of various widely used model grids for stars along the red giant branch. Using open source software, we conduct a comparison of four different evolution grids and we find that age estimations become less reliable if stellar mass is not known, with differences occasionally exceeding $80\%$. Additionally, we note significant disagreements in the models' age estimations at non-solar metallicity. Finally, we present a method for including theoretical uncertainties from stellar evolutionary tracks in age inferences of red giants, aimed at improving the accuracy of age estimation techniques used in the galactic archaeology community.</description>

Abstract: As part of the collaboration building a set of detectors for the new collider, our group was tasked with designing and building a large-scale cosmic ray detector, which was to complement the capabilities of the MPD (Dubna) detec-tor set. The detector was planned as a trigger for cosmic ray particles and to be used to calibrate and test other systems. Additional functions were to be the detection of pairs of high-energy muons originating from some parti-cle decay processes generated during collisions and con-tinuous observation of the cosmic muon stream in order to detect multi muons events. From the very beginning, the detector was designed as a scalable and universal device for many applications. The following work will present the basic features and parameters of the Modular COsmic Ray Detector (MCORD) and examples of its possible use in high energy physics, astrophysics and geology. Thanks to its universal nature, MCORD can be potential used as a fast trigger, neutron veto detector, muon detector and as a tool in muon tomography.</description>

      <title>Introducing STARDIS: An Open and Modular Stellar Spectral Synthesis Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new 1D stellar spectral synthesis Python code called \stardis. \stardis\ is a modular, open-source radiative transfer code that is capable of spectral synthesis from near-UV to IR for FGK stars. We describe the structure, inputs, features, underlying physics, and assumptions of \stardis\ as well as the radiative transfer scheme implemented. To validate our code, we show spectral comparisons between \stardis\ and \textsc{korg} with the same input atmospheric structure models, and also compare qualitatively to \textsc{phoenix} for solar models. We find that \stardis\ generally agrees well with \textsc{korg} for solar models on the few percent level or better, that the codes can diverge in the ultraviolet, with more extreme differences in cooler stars. \stardis\ can be found at \href{https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis}{https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis}, and documentation can be found at \href{https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/}{https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/}.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases due to waveform mismodeling in parametrized post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity: The impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves, due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal -- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters -- such that we are led to falsely identify a ppE deviation in the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral phase at -1PN, 1PN, or 2PN order, due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the ppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE parameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE model. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Combined with Interferometry. III. The Low Column Density HI Around M51 and Possibility of Turbulent-mixing Gas Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a new joint-deconvolution pipeline, we combine the single-dish and interferometric atomic hydrogen (HI) data of M51 observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) (FEASTS program) and the Very Large Array (VLA) (THINGS). The product data cube has a typical line width of $13\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and a $2\sigma$ line-of-sight (LOS) sensitivity of HI column density $N_\text{HI}\sim3.2\times10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ at a spatial resolution of ${\sim}18''$ (${\sim}0.7\,\text{kpc}$). Among the HI-detected LOSs extending to ${\sim}50\,\text{kpc}$, ${\sim}89\%$ consist of diffuse HI only, which is missed by previous VLA observations. The distribution of dense HI is reproduced by previous hydrodynamical simulations of this system, but the diffuse component is not, likely due to unresolved physics related to the interaction between the circumgalactic and interstellar media. With simple models, we find that these low-$N_\text{HI}$ structures could survive the background ultraviolet photoionization, but are susceptible to the thermal evaporation. We find a positive correlation between LOS velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and $N_\text{HI}$ with a logarithmic index of ${\sim}0.5$. Based on existing turbulent mixing layer (TML) theories and simulations, we propose a scenario of hot gas cooling and accreting onto the disk through a TML, which could reproduce the observed power index of ${\sim}0.5$. We estimate the related cooling and accretion rates to be roughly one-third to two-thirds of the star-formation rate. A typical column density of diffuse HI (${\sim}10^{19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) can be accreted within $300\,\text{Myr}$, the interaction time scale previously estimated for the system. Such a gas accretion channel has been overlooked before, and may be important for gas-rich interacting systems and for high redshift galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aditya-L1, India's first dedicated mission to study the Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on 2023 September 2. It carries seven payloads. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on Aditya-L1. VELC is designed to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in the continuum at 5000 A, with a field of view (FoV) from 1.05 Ro to 3 Ro can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of the solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303 A Fexiv, 7892 A Fexi, and 10747 A Fexiii are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50 um, separated by 3.75 mm help to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to +/-1.5 Ro. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747 A also in the FoV range 1.05 - 1.5 Ro. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using a laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time. Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>
