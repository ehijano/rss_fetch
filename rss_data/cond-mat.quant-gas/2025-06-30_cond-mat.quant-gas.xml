      <title>Spontaneous Quantum Turbulence in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate via the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>A canonical approach to quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a canonical formalism for computing quantum fluctuations of certain discrete degrees of freedom in systems governed by integrable partial differential equations with known Hamiltonian structure, provided these models are classical-field approximations of underlying many-body quantum systems. We then apply the formalism to both the 2-soliton and 3-soliton breather solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, assuming the breathers are created from an initial elementary soliton by quenching the coupling constant. In particular, we compute the immediate post-quench quantum fluctuations in the positions, velocities, norms, and phases of the constituent solitons. For each case, we consider both the white-noise and correlated-noise models for the fluctuation vacuum state. Unlike previous treatments of the problem, our method allows for analytic solutions. Additionally, in the correlated-noise case, we consider the particle-number-conserving (also called $U(1)$-symmetry-conserving) Bogoliubov modes, i.e., modes with the proper correction to preserve the total particle number. We find that in most (but not all) cases, these corrections do not change the final result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Bose-Hubbard models have been employed in the study of cold-atom systems with dipolar interactions. It is shown that, for a certain choice of the coupling parameters, there exists an an integrable extended 3-site Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions. A Bethe Ansatz procedure is developed to obtain expressions for the energy spectrum and eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations seeded the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features, pointing towards future experimental probes of the less understood interaction-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Chiral Quantum Droplet in a Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the formation of chiral quantum droplet in a spin-orbit coupled Bose gas, where the system turns to a self-bound droplet when moving towards a particular direction and remains gaseous otherwise. The chirality arises from the breaking of Galilean invariance by spin-orbit coupling, which enables the system to dynamically adjust its condensation momentum and spin polarization in response to its velocity. As a result, only towards a specific moving direction and beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger collective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order transition from gas to droplet. We have mapped out a phase diagram of droplet, gas and their coexistence for realistic spin-orbit coupled 39K mixtures with tunable moving velocity and magnetic detuning. Our results have revealed the emergence of chirality in spin-orbit coupled quantum gases, which shed light on general chiral phenomena in moving systems with broken Galilean invariance.</description>

      <title>Symmetry oscillations sensitivity to SU(2)-symmetry breaking in quantum mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one-dimensional bosonic quantum mixtures with SU(2)-symmetry breaking Hamiltonian, the dynamical evolution explores different particle exchange symmetry sectors. For the case of infinitely strong intra-species repulsion, the hallmark of such symmetry oscillations are time modulations of the momentum distribution [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 183402 (2024)], an observable routinely accessed in experiments with ultracold atoms. In this work we show that this phenomenon is robust in strongly interacting quantum mixtures with arbitrary inter-species to intra-species interaction strength ratio. Taking as initial state the ground state of the SU(2) symmetric Hamiltonian and time-evolving with the symmetry breaking Hamiltonian, we analyze how the amplitude and frequency of symmetry oscillations, and thus of the momentum distribution oscillations, depend on the strength of the symmetry-breaking perturbation. We find that the set of symmetry sectors which are coupled during the time evolution is dictated by the spin-flip symmetry of the initial state and show that the population of the initial state may vanish periodically, even in the thermodynamic limit, thus revealing the robustness and universality of the symmetry oscillations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of rigidity and second sound in dipolar supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical protocol to probe the rigidity and phase coherence of dipolar supersolids by merging initially separated fragments in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) double-well potentials. Simulations based on the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal distinct dynamical signatures across phases. Supersolids exhibit damped crystal oscillations following barrier removal, with the damping rate reflecting superfluid connectivity. A phase-imprinted jump additionally triggers metastable dark solitons, which excites second sound, as revealed by an out-of-phase drift between the droplet lattice and the superfluid background. Our results show a realizable path to dynamically detect the second sound and rigidity of supersolids, as well as to realize and probe soliton formation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of three-body F\"orster resonance for various spatial configurations of the three interacting Rubidium Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms captured in optical traps and laser-excited into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In Ref. [P. Cheinet et al., Quantum Electronics 50(3), 213 (2020)], we proposed and analyzed a new type of three-body F\"orster resonance ${\rm 3}\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2}$ that can be realized with Rb Rydberg atoms for an arbitrary principal quantum number $n$. Its peculiarity is that the third atom goes into a state with a total angular moment $J=1/2$, which has no Stark structure, so two-body F\"orster resonances are completely absent. In the present work, an extended theoretical study of this three-body F\"orster resonance is performed for various spatial configurations of three interacting Rb Rydberg atoms and conditions for their experimental implementation are determined. It was found that one of the resonances has a weak dependence of the resonant electric field on the distance between atoms and is therefore most suitable for performing experiments to observe coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implement three-qubit quantum gates based on them.</description>

      <title>Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in Gaussian beams using a cylindrical lens pair with tunable focal lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for improving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics, quantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction methods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with precise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using standard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements can achieve superior performance, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer from finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a simple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian beams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The first lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the intensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed one behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial lens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the lenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped, resulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically validate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental imperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the output beam of a commercial laser source. Our method corrects astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams without requiring precise focal length matching, offering greater flexibility than other passive solutions and greater cost-effectiveness than active methods. Its simple and compact design makes it well suited for integration into both tabletop optical setups and industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Is Lindblad for me?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems, non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Chirally-protected state manipulation by tuning one-dimensional statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. This is an example for a correlated hopping model where chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter and find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard patterns in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero-energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring in the absence of rotation. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits-where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations-are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state, or an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements and local correction operations to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit. The model has a well-defined classical limit, which we leverage to aid our analysis of the control transition. As a function of the density of local correction operations, we find control and entanglement transitions with continuously varying critical exponents. For sufficiently high densities of local correction operations, we find that both transitions acquire a dynamical critical exponent $z&lt;1$, reminiscent of criticality in long-range power-law interacting systems. At low correction densities, we find that the criticality reverts to a short-range nature with $z\gtrsim 1$. In the long-range regime, the control and entanglement transitions are indistinguishable to within the resolution of our numerics, while in the short-range regime we find evidence that the transitions become distinct. We conjecture that the long-range criticality mediated by collective measurements is essential in driving the two transitions together.</description>
