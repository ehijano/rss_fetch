      <title>Generalizations of the Numerical Radius, Crawford Number and Numerical Index Functions in the Weighted Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, firstly, some simple and smoothness properties of the weighted numerical radius and the weighted Crawford number functions are investigated. Then, some generalization formulas for lower and upper bounds of the weighted numerical radius function are obtained. Later on, some evaluations for lower and upper bounds of the weighted numerical index are given. The obtained results are generalized some well-known famous results about the special weighted numerical radius and the special weighted Crawford number functions in the recently literature. Also, the different and useful results are provided to the literature.</description>

      <title>A remark on dimension and potential free estimates for Riesz transforms associated with Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L=-\Delta + V(x)$ be a Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb R^d$, where $V(x)\geq 0$, $V\in L^2_{\rm loc} (\mathbb R^d)$. We give a short proof of dimension free $L^p(\mathbb R^d)$ estimates, $1&lt;p\leq 2$, for the vector of the Riesz transforms $$\big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}L^{-1/2}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}L^{-1/2},\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_d}L^{-1/2}\Big).$$ The constant in the estimates does not depend on the potential $V$. We simultaneously provide a short proof of the weak type $(1,1)$ estimates for $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}L^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Integrals and Tangency Problems in Integral Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many known Radon-type transforms of symmetric (radial or zonal) functions are represented by one-dimensional Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals or their modifications. The present article contains new examples of such transforms in the Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic settings, when integration is performed over lower-dimensional geodesic spheres or cross-sections, which are tangent to a given surface. Simple inversion formulas are obtained and admissible singularities at the tangency points are studied. Possible applications to the half-ball screening in mathematical tomography and some difficulties related to the general (not necessarily symmetric) case are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gabor frames for quasi-periodic functions and polyanalytic spaces on the flat cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an alternative approach to the study of Fourier series, based on the Short-Time-Fourier Transform (STFT) acting on $L_{\nu }^{2}(0,1)$, the space of measurable functions $f$ in ${R}$, square-integrable in $ (0,1)$, and time-periodic up to a phase factor: for fixed $\nu \in \mathbb{R}$, \begin{equation*} f(t+k)=e^{2\pi ik\nu }f(t)\text{, }k\in \mathbb{Z}\text{.} \end{equation*} The resulting phase space is $[0,1)\times {R}$, a flat model of an infinite cylinder, leading to Gabor frames with a rich structure, including a Janssen-type representation. A Gaussian window leads to a Fock space of entire functions, studied in the companion paper by the same authors [\emph{Beurling-type density theorems for sampling and interpolation on the flat cylinder}]. When $g$ is a Hermite function, we are lead to true Fock spaces of polyanalytic functions (Landau Level eigenspaces) on the vertical strip $[0,1)\times{R}$. Furthermore, an analogue of the sufficient Wexler-Raz conditions is obtained. This leads to a new criteria for Gabor frames in $L^{2}({R})$, to sufficient conditions for Gabor frames in $L_{\nu }^{2}(0,1)$ with Hermite windows (an analogue of a theorem of Gr\"{o}chenig and Lyubarskii about Gabor frames with Hermite windows) and with totally positive windows. We also consider a vectorial STFT in $L_{\nu }^{2}(0,1)$ and the (full) Fock spaces of polyanalytic functions on $[0,1)\times {R}$, associated Bargmann-type transforms, and an analogue of Vasilevski's orthogonal decomposition into true polyanalytic Fock spaces (Landau level eigenspaces on $[0,1)\times {R}$). We conclude with an analogue of Gr\"{o}chenig-Lyubarskii's sufficient condition for Gabor super-frames with Hermite functions, equivalent to a sufficient sampling condition on the full Fock space of polyanalytic functions on $[0,1)\times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce kernels and resolvents on preordered sets and derive sharp resolvent inequalities that entail Gronwall inequalities for functions of several variables. In this way, we can prove a fixed point result for operators on topological spaces that extends Banach's fixed point theorem and allows for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Marcinkiewicz Type Theorems for Interpolation of Operators Acting on M{\"u}ntz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove interpolation results in the spirit of the Marcinkiewicz theorem. The operators considered in this article are defined on M\"untz spaces, which are not dense subspaces of $L^p$, and for which the classical interpolation theory cannot be applied directly. Our proofs crucially rely on strong decoupling of $L^p$ norms, a that was first observed by Gurariy-Macaev and later generalized.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Quadratures with prescribed nodes via moment theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on the real line and let $L$ be the linear functional on univariate polynomials of bounded degree, defined as integration with respect to $\mu$. In 2020, Blekherman et al., the characterization of all minimal quadrature rules of $\mu$ in terms of the roots of a bivariate polynomial is given and two determinantal representations of this polynomial are established. In particular, the authors solved the question of the existence of a minimal quadrature rule with one prescribed node, leaving open the extension to more prescribed nodes. In this paper, we solve this problem using moment theory as the main tool.</description>

      <title>On some new metric characterisations of Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature surrounding the theory of Banach spaces, considerable effort has been invested in exploring the conditions on a Banach space X that characterise X as being an inner product space or as a linearly isomorphic copy of a Hilbert space. On the other hand, a different theory emerges when the class of Banach spaces is looked upon as a Lipschitz category where Lipschitz maps are used as morphisms in the new category in place of the familiar bounded linear maps in the linear theory.
  This paper provides a short survey of recent results involving the appropriate Lipschitz analogues of certain well known results from the linear theory characterizing Hilbert spaces. Whereas isometric description of Hilbert spaces has all along been a popular theme in this line of investigations, we shall concentrate mainly on isomorphic characterisations which entail the existence of an equivalent norm on the underlying space arising from an inner product.</description>

      <title>On positive decompositions and proper splittings of Hermitian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study different aspects of Hermitian operators applying the concept of positive decompositions. On the one hand, we characterize the positivity of an Hermitian operator by means of a norm condition where the factors of certain pseudo polar decomposition of the operator, are involved. On the other hand, we relate the concept of positive orthogonal decomposition of Hermitian operators to the notion of proper splittings of operators. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for the convergence of proper splittings for general bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Bivariate Truncated Moment Sequences with the Column Relation $XY=X^m + q(X)$, with $q$ of degree $m-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the algebraic variety associated with a truncated moment sequence is finite, solving the moment problem follows a well-defined procedure. However, moment problems involving infinite algebraic varieties are more complex and less well-understood. Recent studies suggest that certain bivariate moment sequences can be transformed into equivalent univariate sequences, offering a valuable approach for solving these problems. In this paper, we focus on addressing the truncated moment problem (TMP) for specific rational plane curves. For a curve of general degree we derive an equivalent Hankel positive semidefinite completion problem. For cubic curves, we solve this problem explicitly, which resolves the TMP for one of the four types of cubic curves, up to affine linear equivalence. For the quartic case we simplify the completion problem to a feasibility question of a three-variable system of inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we have presented a unified approach to two classes of Banach spaces defined by means of variations (Waterman spaces and Chanturia classes), utilizing the concepts from the theory of ideals on the set of natural numbers. We defined correspondence between an ideal on the set of natural numbers, a certain sequence space and related space of functions of bounded variation. In this paper, following these ideas, we give characterizations of compact embeddings between different Waterman spaces and between different Chanturia classes: both in terms of sequences defining these function spaces and in terms of properties of ideals corresponding to these function spaces.</description>

      <title>Beurling density theorems for sampling and interpolation on the flat cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Fock space weighted by $e^{-\alpha |z|^{2}}$, of entire and quasi-periodic (modulo a weight dependent on $\nu $) functions on ${C}$. The quotient space $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}$, called `The flat cylinder', is represented by the vertical strip $[0,1)\times \mathbb{R}$, which tiles ${C}$ by ${Z}$-translations and is therefore a fundamental domain for $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}$. Our main result gives a complete characterization of the sets $Z\subset \Lambda \left( \mathbb{Z}\right) $ that are sets of sampling or interpolation, in terms of concepts of upper and lower Beurling densities, $ D^{+}(Z)$ and $D^{-}(Z)$, adapted to the geometry of $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}$. The critical `Nyquist density' is the real number $\frac{\alpha }{\pi }$, meaning that the condition $D^{-}(Z)&gt;\frac{\alpha }{\pi }$ characterizes sets of sampling, while the condition $D^{+}(Z)&lt;\frac{\alpha }{\pi }$ characterizes sets of interpolation. The results can be reframed as a complete characterization of Gabor frames and Riesz basic sequences (given by arbitrary discrete sets in $Z\subset \Lambda \left( \mathbb{Z}\right) $), with time-periodized Gaussian windows (theta-Gaussian), for spaces of functions $f$, measurable in $\mathbb{R}$, square-integrable in $(0,1)$, and quasi-periodic with respect to integer translations.</description>

      <title>On a class of left ideals of nest algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of left ideals (and subalgebras) of nest algebras determined by totally ordered families of partial isometries on a complex Hilbert space $H$.
  Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a family of partial isometries that is totally ordered in the Halmos--McLaughlin ordering, and let $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ be the subset of operators in $B(H)$ which, for all $E\in \mathcal{E}$, map the initial space of $E$ to the final space of $E$. We show that $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ is a subalgebra of $B(H)$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ is a left ideal of a certain nest algebra, and if so,
  $\mathcal{E}$ consists of power partial isometries, except possibly for its supremum $\vee \mathcal{E}$, in which case the range $\operatorname{ran}(\vee \mathcal{E})$ is $H$. It is also shown that any left ideal $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ is decomposable and that the subset of finite rank operators in its closed unit ball is strongly dense in the ball. Necessary and sufficient conditions to solve $Tx=y$ and $T^*x=y$ in $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ are given.</description>

      <title>Invariance of intrinsic hypercontractivity under perturbation of Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger operator that is bounded below and has a unique positive ground state can be transformed into a Dirichlet form operator by the ground state transformation. If the resulting Dirichlet form operator is hypercontractive, Davies and Simon call the Schr\"odinger operator ``intrinsically hypercontractive". I will show that if one adds a suitable potential onto an intrinsically hypercontractive Schr\"odinger operator it remains intrinsically hypercontractive. The proof uses a fortuitous relation between the WKB equation and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. All bounds are dimension independent. The main theorem will be applied to several examples.</description>

      <title>Operator estimates in homogenization of L\'evy-type operators with periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with homogenization of self-adjoint operators in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$ of the form $$ ({\mathbb A}_\eps u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu(\x/\eps, \y/\eps) \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y, $$ where $0&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$, and $\eps&gt;0$ is a small parameter. It is assumed that the function $\mu(\x,\y)$ is $\Z^d$-periodic in each variable, $\mu(\x,\y)=\mu(\y,\x)$ for all $\x$ and $\y$, and $0&lt; \mu_- \leqslant \mu(\x,\y) \leqslant \mu_+&lt; \infty$. Under these assumptions we show that the resolvent $({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1}$ converges, as $\eps\to0$, in the operator norm in $L_2(\R^d)$ to the resolvent $({\mathbb A}^0 + I)^{-1}$ of the limit operator ${\mathbb A}^0$ given by $$ ({\mathbb A}^0 u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu^0 \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y, $$ where $\mu^0$ is the mean value of $\mu(\x,\y)$. We also show that the operator norm of the discrepancy $\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1}\|_{L_2(\mathbb R^d)\to L_2(\mathbb R^d)}$ can be estimated by $O(\eps^\alpha)$, if $0&lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, by $O(\eps (1 + | \operatorname{ln} \eps|)^2)$, if $ \alpha =1$, and by $O(\eps^{2- \alpha})$, if $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates and Higher Order Trotter Product Formulas in Jordan-Banach Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Projection Characterization and Symmetry Bootstrap for Elements of a von Neumann Algebra that are Nearby Commuting Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a symmetry map $\varphi$ on a unital $C^\ast$-algebra $\mathcal A$ to be an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map on $\mathcal A$ that generalizes transformations on matrices like: transpose, adjoint, complex-conjugation, conjugation by a unitary matrix, and their compositions. We include an overview of such symmetry maps on unital $C^\ast$-algebras. We say that $A\in\mathcal A$ is $\varphi$-symmetric if $\varphi(A)=A$, $A$ is $\varphi$-antisymmetric if $\varphi(A)=-A$, and $A$ has a $\zeta=e^{i\theta}$ $\varphi$-phase symmetry if $\varphi(A)=\zeta A$.
  Our main result is a new projection characterization of two operators $U$ (unitary), $B$ that have nearby commuting operators $U'$ (unitary), $B'$. This can be used to ``bootstrap'' symmetry from operators $U, B$ that are nearby some commuting operators $U', B'$ to prove the existence of nearby commuting operators $U'', B''$ which satisfy the same symmetries/antisymmetries/phase symmetries as $U, B$, provided that the symmetry maps and symmetries/antisymmetries/phase symmetries satisfy some mild conditions. We also prove a version of this for $X=U$ self-adjoint instead of unitary.
  As a consequence of the prior literature and the results of this paper, we prove Lin's theorem with symmetries: If a $\varphi$-symmetric matrix $A$ is almost normal ($\|[A^\ast, A]\|$ is small), then it is nearby a $\varphi$-symmetric normal matrix $A'$. We also extend this further to include rotational and dihedral symmetries.
  We also obtain bootstrap symmetry results for two and three almost commuting self-adjoint operators. As a corollary, we resolve a conjecture of arXiv:1502.03498 for two almost commuting self-adjoint matrices in the Atland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes related to topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: For rescaled additive functionals of the sine-process, upper bounds are obtained for their speed of convergence to the Gaussian distribution with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric. Under scaling with coefficient $R$ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded from above by $c/\log R$ for a smooth function and by $c/R$ for a function holomorphic in a horizontal strip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a bounded domain $\O$ and $f$ of zero integral, the existence of a vector fields $\u$ vanishing on $\partial\O$ and satisfying $\d\u=f$ has been widely studied because of its connection with many important problems. It is known that for $f\in L^p(\O)$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, there exists a solution $\u\in W^{1,p}_0(\O)$, and also that an analogous result is not true for $p=1$ or $p=\infty$. The goal of this paper is to prove results for Hardy spaces when $\frac{n}{n+1}&lt;p\le 1$, and in the other limiting case, for bounded mean oscillation and Lipschitz spaces. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain a Korn inequality for vector fields in Hardy-Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory I: pointwise domination and weighted estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to establish some specific weighted quantitative estimates for the generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}$ is the crux of this paper, which is defined by $$\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}(\vec{f})(x):= \mathcal{T}_{\eta}\left((b_1(x) - b_1)^{\beta_1}f_1,\ldots,(b_m(x) - b_m)^{\beta_m}f_m\right)(x),$$ where $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}$ is a multilinear fractional singular integral operator, ${\bf b}:=({b_1}, \cdots ,{b_m})$ is a set of symbol functions, and $({\beta _1}, \cdots ,{\beta _m}) \in {\mathbb{N}_0^m}$.
  Pointwise dominating the aforementioned commutators leads us to consider a class of higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator ${\mathcal A}_{\eta ,\mathcal{S},\tau}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$ to achieve this long-cherished wish. Therefore, it suffices to construct its quantitative weighted estimates, which firstly include the characterization of several types of multilinear weighted conditions $A_{\vec p,q}^*$, $W_{\vec p,q}^\infty$, and $H_{\vec p,q}^\infty$. Within the scope of this work, Bloom type estimate for first-order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator is established herein. Moreover, we derive two distinct Bloom type estimates for higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator by using "maximal weight method" and "iterated weight method" respectively, which not only refines some of Lerner's methods but greatly enhances the generality of our conclusions. Endpoint quantitative estimates for multilinear fractional singular integral operators and their first-order commutators are also obtained as the last main result. It is also worthy of highlighting that some important multilinear fractional operators are applicable to our results as applications.</description>

      <title>Causal evolution of probability measures and continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of a causal time-evolution of a conserved nonlocal physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^\infty_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to the topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic spectral bounds on the $\varepsilon$-entropy of kernel classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K: \boldsymbol{\Omega}\times \boldsymbol{\Omega}$ be a continuous Mercer kernel defined on a compact subset of ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $\mathcal{H}_K$ be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with $K$. Given a finite measure $\nu$ on $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$, we investigate upper and lower bounds on the $\varepsilon$-entropy of the unit ball of $\mathcal{H}_K$ in the space $L_p(\nu)$. This topic is an important direction in the modern statistical theory of kernel-based methods.
  We prove sharp upper and lower bounds for $p\in [1,+\infty]$. For $p\in [1,2]$, the upper bounds are determined solely by the eigenvalue behaviour of the corresponding integral operator $\phi\to \int_{\boldsymbol{\Omega}} K(\cdot,{\mathbf y})\phi({\mathbf y})d\nu({\mathbf y})$. In constrast, for $p&gt;2$, the bounds additionally depend on the convergence rate of the truncated Mercer series to the kernel $K$ in the $L_p(\nu)$-norm.
  We discuss a number of consequences of our bounds and show that they are substantially tighter than previous bounds for general kernels. Furthermore, for specific cases, such as zonal kernels and the Gaussian kernel on a box, our bounds are asymptotically tight as $\varepsilon\to +0$.</description>

Abstract: Using extrapolation theory, we develop a new framework to prove the uniqueness of solutions for transport equations. We apply our methodology to unify and extend the classical results of Yudovich and Vishik for 2D Euler equations. In particular, we establish the uniqueness for the Euler flow whose vorticity belongs to new scales of function spaces that contain both Yudovich spaces and BMO.

      <title>Plateau Bubbles and the Quintuple Bubble Theorem on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sullivan's multi-bubble isoperimetric conjectures in $n$-dimensional Euclidean and spherical spaces assert that standard bubbles uniquely minimize total perimeter among all $q-1$ bubbles enclosing prescribed volume, for any $q \leq n+2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^3$ was confirmed by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritor\'e-Ros (and later extended to $\mathbb{R}^n$). The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^n$ ($n \geq 2$) and the triple- and quadruple- bubble conjectures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ (for $n \geq 3$ and $n \geq 4$, respectively) were recently confirmed in our previous work, but the approach employed there does not seem to allow extending these results further.
  In this work, we confirm the quintuple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^n$ ($n \geq 5$), and as a consequence, by approximation, also the quintuple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \geq 5$) but without the uniqueness assertion. Moreover, we resolve the conjectures on $\mathbb{S}^n$ and on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (without uniqueness) for all $q \leq n+1$, conditioned on the assumption that the singularities which appear at the meeting locus of several bubbles obey a higher-dimensional analogue of Plateau's laws. Another scenario we can deal with is when the bubbles are full-dimensional ("in general position"), or arrange in some good lower-dimensional configurations.
  To this end, we develop the spectral theory of the corresponding Jacobi operator (finding analogies with the quantum-graph formalism), and a new method for deforming the bubbles into a favorable configuration. As a by-product, we show that the Jacobi operator on a minimizing configuration always has index precisely $q-1$ and hence the corresponding isoperimetric profile is concave, answering a question of Heppes. Several compelling conjectures are proposed, which would allow extending our results to all $q \leq n+1$ unconditionally.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators with Stochastic Gradient Descent in General Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates leveraging stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to learn operators between general Hilbert spaces. We propose weak and strong regularity conditions for the target operator to depict its intrinsic structure and complexity. Under these conditions, we establish upper bounds for convergence rates of the SGD algorithm and conduct a minimax lower bound analysis, further illustrating that our convergence analysis and regularity conditions quantitatively characterize the tractability of solving operator learning problems using the SGD algorithm. It is crucial to highlight that our convergence analysis is still valid for nonlinear operator learning. We show that the SGD estimator will converge to the best linear approximation of the nonlinear target operator. Moreover, applying our analysis to operator learning problems based on vector-valued and real-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields new convergence results, thereby refining the conclusions of existing literature.</description>

      <title>A generation theorem for the perturbation of strongly continuous semigroups by unbounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness of the evolution equation of the form $u'(t)=Au(t)+Cu(t)$, $t\ge 0$, where $A$ is the generator of a $C_0$- semigroup and $C$ is a (possibly unbounded) linear operator in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$. We prove that if $A$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_A(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ with $\|T(t)\| \le Me^{\omega t}$ in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ and $C$ is a linear operator in $\mathbb{X}$ such that $D(A)\subset D(C)$ and $\| CR(\mu ,A)\| \le K/(\mu -\omega)$ for each $\mu&gt;\omega$, then, the above-mentioned evolution equation is well-posed, that is, $A+C$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_{A+C}(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\| T_{A+C}(t)\| \le Me^{(\omega +MK)t}$. Our approach is to use the Hille-Yosida Theorem. Discussions on the persistence of asymptotic behavior of the perturbed equations such as the roughness of exponential dichotomy are also given. The obtained results seem to be new.</description>

Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Extreme Points of Spectrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of characterizing extreme points of the convex set of positive linear operators on a possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space under linear constraints. We show that even perturbations of points in such sets admit what resembles a Douglas factorization. Using this result, we prove that an operator is extreme iff a corresponding set of linear operators is dense in the space of trace-class self-adjoint operators with range contained in the closure of the range of that operator. If the number of constraints is finite, we show that the extreme point must be of low-rank relative to the number of constraints and derive a purely rank-based characterization of the extreme points.
  In the finite-dimensional setting, our results lead to a remarkably simple characterization of the elliptope, that is, the set of correlation matrices, in terms of the Hadamard product which allows us to characterize the set of matrices which constitute the equality case of the Hadamard rank inequality when the involved matrices are equal and positive semi-definite. We illustrate the importance of our results using examples from statistics and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>
