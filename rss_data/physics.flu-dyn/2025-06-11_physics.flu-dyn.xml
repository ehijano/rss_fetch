      <title>Moving contact lines of power-law fluids: How nonlinear fluid rheology drastically alters stress singularity and dynamic wetting behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law fluids can strongly affect the degree of the contact line stress singularity and hence the nature of moving contact lines. We develop a framework beyond the classical paradigm for power-law fluids, providing a unified account for the distinct behaviors of the advancing contact lines. We show that the apparent dynamic contact angle $\theta_d$ can depend on the extent of the characteristic dissipation length $h^* \propto U_n/(n-1)$, altering its dependence on the contact line speed $U$. For shear-thinning fluids, we find $\theta_d \sim (h/h^*)^{(1-n)/3}$, with contact line motion being dissipated within $h^*$ extending beyond the local wedge height $h$ without requiring a cutoff. In drop spreading problems, $\theta_d$ varies with the spreading radius $R$, leading to $\theta_d \propto U^{3n/(2n+7)}$ consistent with the spreading law $R \propto t^{n/(3n+7)}$ derived from a self-similar solution, where $R$ is the spreading radius and $t$ is time. For shear-thickening fluids, the apparent contact line motion is characterized by $\theta_d \sim (h^*/h_m)^{(1-n)/3}$, where dissipation is concentrated within $h^*$ which is smaller than the microscopic liquid height $h_m$ near the contact line. In fact, the dynamic contact angle relationship in this case can be expressed as the Cox-Voinov law $\theta_d \sim Ca_{eff}^{1/3}$ in terms of a capillary number $Ca_{eff} =\eta_f U/\gamma$ where $\gamma$ is the surface tension and $\eta_f \propto (U/ h_m)^{n-1}$ is the viscosity based on the local shear rate $U/h_m$ across $h_m$. We also show that a precursor film induced by molecular forces ahead of the wedge leads to $h_m \propto U^{-n/(4-n)}$ and hence $\theta_d \propto U^{3n/(4-n)}$, making the spreading behavior highly sensitive to the contact line microstructure. Our predictions show good agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing semi-resolved CFD-DEM for dilute to dense particle-fluid systems: A point cloud based, two-step mapping strategy via coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) coupling is an efficient and powerful tool to simulate particle-fluid systems. However, current volume-averaged CFD-DEM relying on direct grid-based mapping between the fluid and particle phases can exhibit a strong dependence on the fluid grid resolution, becoming unstable as particles move across fluid grids, and can fail to capture pore fluid pressure effects in very dense granular systems. Here we propose a two-step mapping CFD-DEM which uses a point-based coarse graining technique for intermediate smoothing to overcome these limitations. The discrete particles are first converted into smooth, coarse-grained continuum fields via a multi-layer Fibonacci point cloud, independent of the fluid grids. Then, accurate coupling is achieved between the coarse-grained, point cloud fields and the fluid grid-based variables. The algorithm is validated in various configurations, including weight allocation of a static particle on one-dimensional grids and a falling particle on two-dimensional grids, sedimentation of a sphere in a viscous fluid, size-bidisperse fluidized beds, Ergun's pressure drop test, and immersed granular column collapse. The proposed CFD-DEM represents a novel strategy to accurately simulate fluid-particle interactions for a wide range of grid-to-particle size ratios and solid concentrations, which is of potential use in many industrial and geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Lagrangian Particles in Shell Models of Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian acceleration has been investigated both experimentally and numerically in the past, and it has been shown to exhibit extreme fluctuations, which have been rationalized as events in which tracer particles get trapped into vortical structures such as vortex tubes or filaments. Here, we consider the statistics of acceleration within the multifractal framework, as in Biferale et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 064502 (2004), and investigate the statistics of Lagrangian acceleration using shell models of turbulence, as in G. Boffetta et al. Phys. Rev. E 66, 066307 (2002), that -- by construction -- do not contain vortical structures. Our analysis shows that, even in the absence of coherent vortex structures, the multifractal model accurately captures the extreme intermittent fluctuations observed in the acceleration, with predictions that remain robust across a wide range of Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Deformation of ellipsoidal droplets in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of deformation of neutrally buoyant droplets in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), wherein the characteristic droplet size $R$ is smaller than the characteristic Kolmogorov scale $\eta$ of the turbulent flow. We systematically focus on the characterization of droplet statistics obtained with various phenomenological ellipsoidal models (EMs) -- assuming that the droplet preserves the ellipsoidal shape at all times - with the droplet moving as a passive tracer in the turbulent flow. The predictions of the EMs are compared with ground-truth data obtained with three-dimensional fully resolved simulations (FRSs) without any ad-hoc assumption on the droplet shape. Our work helps in elucidating the applicability of the EMs in describing droplet deformation in HIT at changing the capillary number $\text{Ca}=\tau_{\sigma}/\tau_{\eta}$, weighting the relative importance of the droplet characteristic time $\tau_{\sigma}$ with respect to the turbulent flow characteristic time $\tau_{\eta}$.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian analysis of turbulent blood flow in the human left heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian analysis of turbulent blood flow in the human left heart using high-fidelity simulations based on a patient-specific anatomical model. Leveraging a fully coupled fluid-structure-electrophysiology interaction (FSEI) framework, we track the motion of Lagrangian (passive) tracers to investigate the multiscale statistical properties of velocity fluctuations over more than four decades. Our analysis reveals strong Lagrangian intermittency throughout the left heart, reflecting the complex and unsteady nature of cardiovascular flow. The present work underscores the sensitivity of Lagrangian statistics to physiological parameters and highlights their potential for improving the understanding of pathological flow conditions in cardiovascular systems. Such Lagrangian tool provides a statistical foundation for modeling shear-induced damage in red blood cells (hemolysis), with implications for the evaluation of prosthetic valves and blood-contacting medical devices.</description>

      <title>Droplet on a sugar fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a water droplet on a single vertical sugar fiber is analyzed. The fiber is positioned vertically, with the droplet placed at its pending end. If the capillary force exceeds the weight of the droplet, the droplet remains suspended at the fiber's extremity. As water dissolves, the fiber eventually breaks. Subsequently, the droplet may fall down carrying a portion of the undissolved fiber or, more interestingly, the droplet may be propelled upwards, remaining attached to the fiber. The process can then restart. A phase diagram is constructed based on the droplet's volume and the fiber's diameter. A model has been built to assess the critical droplet volume for a given fiber diameter, above which the droplet falls. Below this volume, the droplet can move upwards along the fiber.</description>

      <title>Heavy Particle Motion in Rotational Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the motion of spherical inertial particles in a three-dimensional rotating cylindrical vortex - a simplified model of geophysical flow structures such as oceanic eddies. The analytical vortex formulation enables the isolation of the key mechanisms that govern particle transport in rotating flows. Using Lagrangian particle tracking simulations, we investigate the influence of drag, buoyancy, virtual mass, Coriolis, and Magnus lift forces across a range of particle sizes, densities, and vortex rotation rates. Results show that particle aggregation and periodic stability depend on both particle inertia and flow parameters. Rotational lift forces, though often neglected for spherical particles, become dominant at moderate particle Stokes numbers and introduce slow vertical oscillations in both particle position and spin. The balance of forces determines whether particles settle into stable periodic orbits or escape the vortex. Our analysis reveals unique equilibrium positions that exhibit bifurcations, with multiple or vanishing steady states depending on particle and flow characteristics. Our results demonstrate how particle aggregation and orbital stability stem from the complex coupling between rotational lift, Coriolis, drag, buoyancy, and virtual mass forces. This model may promote informed modeling of dispersed phase transport in marine flows and industrial mixing processes.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse-Interface Marangoni Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel Marangoni-induced instability that arises exclusively in diffuse fluid interfaces, absent in classical sharp-interface models. Using a validated phase-field Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn framework, we linearize the governing equations to analyze the onset and development of interfacial instability driven by solute-induced surface tension gradients. A critical interfacial thickness scaling inversely with the Marangoni number, $\delta_\mathrm{cr} \sim Ma^{-1}$, emerges from the balance between advective and diffusive transport. Unlike sharp-interface scenarios where matched viscosity and diffusivity stabilize the interface, finite thickness induces asymmetric solute distributions and tangential velocity shifts that destabilize the system. We identify universal power-law scalings of velocity and concentration offsets with a modified Marangoni number $Ma^\delta$, independent of capillary number and interfacial mobility. A critical crossover at $Ma^\delta \approx 590$ distinguishes diffusion-dominated stabilization from advection-driven destabilization. These findings highlight the importance of diffuse-interface effects in multiphase flows, with implications for miscible fluids, soft matter, and microfluidics where interfacial thickness and coupled transport phenomena are non-negligible.</description>

      <title>Displacement of three-phase flow for Heavy Oil: Riemann Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the Riemann solution for three-phase flow in porous media under the condition that oil viscosity exceeds that of water and gas. We classify all Riemann solution problems for scenarios where the left states $L$ lie along the edge $G$-$W$, and the right states $R$ span nearly the entire saturation triangle, excluding small regions near the boundaries $G$-$O$ and $W$-$O$. We use the wave curve method to determine the Riemann solution for initial and injection data within the above-mentioned class. This study extends previous analytical solutions, which were limited to right states near the corner $O$ or within the quadrilateral $O$-$E$-$\mathcal{U}$-$D$. Notably, this classification remains valid for all viscosity variations satisfying the inequalities \eqref{eq:classical}, corresponding to viscosity regimes where the umbilic point is close to the vertex $O$. We verify the $L^1_{loc}$-stability of the Riemann solution with respect to variations in the data. While we do not establish the uniqueness of the Riemann solution, extensive numerical experiments confirm its validity. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding three-phase flow dynamics in porous media under a wide range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Chebyshev Polynomials for Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential in scientific forecasting and fluid dynamics. Traditional approaches often incur expensive computational costs and trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy. Recent deep neural networks improve the accuracy but require high-quality training data. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) effectively integrate physical laws to reduce the data reliance in limited sample scenarios. A novel machine-learning framework, Chebyshev physics-informed Kolmogorov--Arnold network (ChebPIKAN), is proposed to integrate the robust architectures of Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KAN) with physical constraints to enhance the calculation accuracy of PDEs for fluid mechanics. We study the fundamentals of KAN, take advantage of the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomial basis functions in spline fitting, and integrate physics-informed loss functions that are tailored to specific PDEs in fluid dynamics, including Allen--Cahn equation, nonlinear Burgers equation, Helmholtz equations, Kovasznay flow, cylinder wake flow, and cavity flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ChebPIKAN model significantly outperforms the standard KAN architecture in solving various PDEs by effectively embedding essential physical information. These results indicate that augmenting KAN with physical constraints can alleviate the overfitting issues of KAN and improve the extrapolation performance. Consequently, this study highlights the potential of ChebPIKAN as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and propose a path toward fast and reliable predictions in fluid mechanics and beyond.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Scaling for Roughness Transitions in Turbulent Flows: The Role of the Internal Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When turbulent boundary layer flows encounter abrupt roughness changes, an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) forms. Equilibrium theory breaks down in the nonequilibrium IBL, which may extend O(10) km for natural atmospheric flows. Here, we find that the IBL possesses a characteristic time-scale associated with the IBL height, ${\delta}_i$. We show that ${\delta}_i$ and the edge velocity set the scales of the mean and defect velocity profiles within the IBL, for simulation and experimental data covering a multitude of roughness transition types. We present a nontrivial extension of equilibrium theory to the dynamically adjusting IBL, which can be useful for modeling a range of environmental and industrial flows.</description>

      <title>AeroDiT: Diffusion Transformers for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with average relative L2 errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure p and velocity components ux, uy, confirming its reliability. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, outperforming traditional U-net diffusion models. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to persistent challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Resolving Integral Simulations for Wall-Bounded Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical fidelity of turbulence models can benefit from a partial resolution of fluctuations, but doing so often comes with an increase in computational cost. To explore this trade-off in the context of wall-bounded flows, this paper introduces a framework for Turbulence-Resolving Integral Simulations (TRIS) with the goal of efficiently resolving the largest motions using a two-dimensional, three component representation of the flow defined by instantaneous wall-normal integrals of velocity and pressure. Self-sustaining turbulence with qualitatively realistic large-scale structures is demonstrated for TRIS on an open-channel (half-channel) flow configuration using moment-of-momentum integral equations derived from Navier-Stokes with relatively simple closure approximations. Evidence from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) suggests that TRIS can theoretically resolve 35-40% of the turbulent skin friction enhancement for friction Reynolds numbers between 180 and 5200, without a noticeable decrease or increase as a function of Reynolds number. The current implementation of TRIS can match this resolution while simulating one flow through time in ~1 minute on a single processor, even for very large Reynolds numbers. The framework facilitates a detailed apples-to-apples comparison of predicted statistics against data from DNS. Comparisons at friction Reynolds numbers of 395 and 590 show that TRIS generates a relatively accurate representation of the flow, while highlight discrepancies that demonstrate a need for improving the closure models. The present results for open-channel flow represent a proof of concept for TRIS as a new approach for wall-bounded turbulence modeling, motivating extension to more general flow configurations such as boundary layers on immersed objects.</description>

      <title>Consistent continuum equations and numerical benchmarks for a perturbation-based, variable-coefficient acoustofluidic solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a consistent continuum framework and a variable-coefficient acoustofluidic solver to analyze acoustic streaming. A perturbation approach is used to split the compressible Navier-Stokes equations into two sub-systems: a first-order harmonic system and a time-averaged second-order mean system. Prior acoustofluidic numerical studies have typically employed simplifying assumptions regarding the second-order mass balance equation and boundary conditions. These assumptions -- frequently left unjustified -- result in an incongruent problem statement where the boundary conditions are not consistent with the governing equations. To clarify these assumptions and mitigate the associated confusion, we systematically formulate the second-order mass balance equation into two analytically equivalent but numerically distinct forms by introducing the fluid's Lagrangian and mass transport velocity. We clarify the relation between these quantities to illustrate that a zero mass transport velocity does not necessarily imply a zero Lagrangian velocity. A second-order accurate finite difference/volume scheme is used to discretize the governing equations and boundary conditions expressed in Eulerian form. We solve the first-order coupled Helmholtz system via a sparse direct solver while the second-order system is solved via a Krylov (FGMRES) solver with a projection method-based preconditioner. To ascertain the spatial accuracy and consistency of numerical implementation of the split system of equations and boundary conditions, we demonstrate verification results and convergence rates using manufactured solutions. We provide benchmark test cases to demonstrate the impact of the choice of boundary conditions on second-order flow field. Lastly, we examine a system with spatially varying density to illustrate the difference in flow fields between constant and variable density systems.</description>

      <title>Defining the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness based on streamwise velocity skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new statistical definition for the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness is introduced, based on identification of the point where the streamwise velocity skewness changes sign, from negative to positive, in the outermost region of the boundary layer. Importantly, this definition is independent of arbitrary thresholds, and broadly applicable, including to past single-point measurements. Further, this definition is motivated by the phenomenology of streamwise velocity fluctuations near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, whose local characteristics are shown to be universal for turbulent boundary layers under low freestream turbulence conditions (i.e., with or without pressure gradients, surface roughness, etc.) through large-scale experiments, simulations and coherent structure-based modelling. The new approach yields a turbulent boundary layer thickness that is consistent with previous definitions, such as those based on Reynolds shear stress or `composite' mean velocity profiles, and which can be used practically e.g., to calculate integral thicknesses. Two methods are proposed for estimating the turbulent boundary layer thickness using this definition: one based on simple linear interpolation and the other on fitting a generalised Fourier model to the outer skewness profile. The robustness and limitations of these methods are demonstrated through analysis of several published experimental and numerical datasets, which cover a range of canonical and non-canonical turbulent boundary layers. These datasets also vary in key characteristics such as wall-normal resolution and measurement noise, particularly in the critical turbulent/non-turbulent interface region.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of decaying turbulence beneath surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores decaying turbulence beneath surface waves that is initially isotropic and shear-free. We start by presenting phenomenology revealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular momentum in coherent vortices perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of depth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with rotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$, takes on the role of the background vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \beta y) \hat{\boldsymbol{z}}$ on the beta plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation model proposed by Bardina et al. (1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the simulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the two-equation model -- which explicitly parametrizes wave-driven suppression of kinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about a wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation model, which we term the "pseudovorticity number" after the pseudovorticity $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$. The pseudovorticity number is related to the Langmuir number in an integral sense.</description>

      <title>Diffuselet method for three-dimensional turbulent mixing of a cloudy air filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixing properties of vapor content, temperature and particle fields are of paramount importance in cloud turbulence as they pertain to essential processes, such as cloud water droplet evaporation and entrainment. Our study examines the mixing of a single cloudy air (which implies droplet-laden) filament with its clear air environment, a characteristic process at the cloud edge, in two ways. The first consists of three-dimensional combined Euler-Lagrangian direct numerical simulations which describe the scalar supersaturation as an Eulerian field and the individual cloud water droplets as an ensemble of Lagrangian tracers. The second way builds on the recently developed diffuselet method, a kinematic Lagrangian framework that decomposes a scalar filament into a collection of small sections subject to deformation by local stirring and cross-sheet diffusion. The Schmidt number is Sc=0.7. The entrainment process causes a deformation of the supersaturated cloud filament in combination with diffusion until the system reaches a well-mixed equilibrium state, which implies for the present configuration that all droplets are evaporated. We compare the time dependence of the mean square and probability density function of the supersaturation field. For the initial period of the mixing process they agree very well; at later stages deviations caused by non-zero mean of the conserved scalar are observed. For the cases including cloud water droplets, we investigate also the impact of droplet number density and condensation growth response. Turbulence causes deviations from the d^2-law similar to recent experiments in sprays. A simulation at a Schmidt number that is by a factor of 100 larger than in clouds improves the agreement between simulation and diffuselet method significantly. The latter result promotes the diffuselet framework as an efficient parametrization for turbulent high-Sc...</description>

      <title>Analytic adjoint solution for incompressible potential flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the analytic adjoint solution for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible potential flow for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force using the connection of the adjoint approach to Green's functions and also by establishing and exploiting its relation to the adjoint incompressible Euler equations. By comparison with the analytic solution, it is shown that the naive approach based on solving Laplace's equation for the adjoint variables can be ill-defined. The analysis of the boundary behavior of the analytic solution is used to discuss the proper formulation of the adjoint problem as well as the mechanism for incorporating the Kutta condition in the adjoint formulation</description>

      <title>Reducing turbulent transport in tokamaks by combining intrinsic rotation and the low momentum diffusivity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of a large number of high-fidelity nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we propose a novel strategy to improve confinement in spherical tokamak plasmas by combining up-down asymmetric flux surface shaping with the Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. We show that the intrinsic momentum flux driven by up-down asymmetry creates strong flow shear in the LMD regime that can significantly reduce energy transport, increasing the critical gradient by up to $25\%$. In contrast to traditional methods for generating flow shear, such as neutral beam injection, this approach requires no external momentum source and is expected to scale well to large fusion devices. The experimental applicability of this strategy in spherical tokamaks is addressed via simulations by considering actual equilibria from MAST and a preliminary equilibrium from SMART.</description>

      <title>Near-Inertial Pollard Waves Modeling the Arctic Halocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit and exact solution to the governing equations describing the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean region centered around the North Pole. The solution describes a stratified water column with three constant-density regions: a motionless bottom layer, a middle layer - the halocline - described by nonhydrostatic, near-inertial Pollard waves, and an upper layer presenting a mean current and a wave motion associated with the one in the halocline layer.</description>
