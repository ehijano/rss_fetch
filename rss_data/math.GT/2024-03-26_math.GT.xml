      <title>Hyperbolic L-space knots and their Upsilon invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a knot in the 3-sphere, the Upsilon invariant is a piecewise linear function defined on the interval [0,2]. For an L-space knot, the Upsilon invariant is determined only by the Alexander polynomial of the knot. We exhibit infinitely many pairs of hyperbolic L-space knots such that two knots of each pair have distinct Alexander polynomials, so they are not concordant, but share the same Upsilon invariant. Conversely, we examine the restorability of the Alexander polynomial of an L-space knot from the Upsilon invariant through the Legendre-Fenchel transformation.</description>

      <title>Monopoles and transverse knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for studying transverse knots and symplectic surfaces utilizing the Seiberg-Witten monopole equation. Our primary approach involves investigating an equivariant Seiberg-Witten theory introduced by Baraglia-Hekmati on branched covers, incorporating invariant contact/symplectic structures.
  Within this framework, we introduce a novel slice-torus invariant denoted as $q_M(K)$. This invariant can be viewed as the Seiberg-Witten analog of Hendriks-Lipshitz-Saker's $q_\tau$ invariant, with a signature correction term. One property of the invariant $q_M(K)$ is an adjunction equality for properly embedded connected symplectic surfaces in the symplectic filling $D^4\# m \overline{\mathbb{C}P}^2$. The proof of this equality utilizes the equivariant version of the homotopical contact invariant introduced by the authors, leading to a transverse knot invariant. Another ingredient of the proof involves constructing invariant symplectic structures on branched covering spaces branched along properly embedded symplectic surfaces in symplectic fillings. As an application of the invariant $q_M(K)$, we determine the value of any slice-torus invariant within a permissible deviation of $2$ for squeezed knots concordant to certain Montesinos knots. Additionally, we provide an obstruction to realizing second homology classes of $D^4 \#m \overline{\mathbb{C}P}^2$ as connected embedded symplectic surfaces with transverse knot boundary or connected embedded Lagrangian surfaces with collarable Legendrian knot boundary. Moreover, we introduce a new obstruction to certain Montesinos knots being quasipositive, which is described only in terms of slice genera and their signatures.</description>

      <title>The Goeritz groups of $(1,1)$-decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(g, n)$-decomposition of a link $L$ in a closed orientable $3$-manifold $M$ is a decomposition of $M$ by a closed orientable surface of genus $g$ into two handebodies each of which intersects the link $L$ in $n$ trivial arcs. The Goeritz group of that decomposition is then defined to be the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the pair $(M, L)$ preserving the decomposition. We compute the Goeritz groups of all $(1,1)$-decompositions.</description>

      <title>The smooth Mordell-Weil group and mapping class groups of elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the Mordell-Weil Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove a smooth version of the Mordell-Weil Theorem and apply it to the `unipotent radical' case of a Thurston-type classification of mapping classes of simply-connected $4$-manifolds $M_d$ that admit the structure of an elliptic complex surface of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$. Applications include Nielsen realization theorems for $M_d$.
  By combining this with known results, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: if the singular fibers of such an elliptic fibration are of the simplest (i.e.\ nodal) type, then the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. In particular, any diffeomorphism of $M_d,d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\phi \in {\rm Mod}(\Sigma)$ be an arbitrary element of the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface $\Sigma$ of genus at least $2$. For any characteristic cover $\widetilde{\Sigma} \to \Sigma$ one can consider the linear subspace ${\rm H}_1^{f.o.}(\widetilde{\Sigma}, \mathbb{Q})^\phi \subseteq {\rm H}_1(\widetilde{\Sigma}, \mathbb{Q})$ consisting of all homology classes with finite $\phi$-orbit. We prove that $\dim {\rm H}_1^{f.o.}(\widetilde{\Sigma}, \mathbb{Q})^\phi$ can be arbitrary large for any fixed $\phi \in {\rm Mod}(\Sigma)$.</description>

Abstract: We extend a construction of Jones to associate $(n, n)$-tangles with elements of Thompson's group $F$ and prove that it is asymptotically faithful as $n \to\infty$. Using this construction we show that the oriented Thompson group $\vec F$ admits a lax group action on a category of Khovanov's chain complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using geometric arguments, we compute the group of homotopy classes of maps from a closed $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold to the $n$-sphere for $n \geq 3$. Our work extends results from Kirby, Melvin and Teichner for closed oriented 4-manifolds and from Konstantis for closed $(n+1)$-dimensional spin manifolds, considering possibly non-orientable and non-spinnable manifolds. In the process, we introduce two types of manifolds that generalize the notion of odd and even 4-manifolds. Furthermore, for the case that $n \geq 4$, we discuss applications for rank $n$ spin vector bundles and obtain a refinement of the Euler class in the cohomotopy group that fully obstructs the existence of a non-vanishing section.</description>

Abstract: Using instanton homology with coefficients in $Z/2$ we construct a homomorphism $q_2$ from the homology cobordism group in dimension 3 to the integers which is not a rational linear combination of the instanton $h$--invariant and the Heegaard Floer correction term $d$. If an oriented homology $3$--sphere $Y$ bounds a smooth, compact, negative definite $4$--manifold without $2$--torsion in its homology then $q_2(Y)\ge0$, with strict inequality if the intersection form is non-standard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of mc-biquandles, algebraic structures which have possibly distinct biquandle operations at single-component and multi-component crossings. These structures provide computable homset invariants for classical and virtual links. We categorify these homsets to obtain mc-biquandle coloring quivers and define several new link invariants via decategorification from these invariant quivers.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of locally symmetric rank one manifolds of infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss questions by Mostow \cite{Mo1}, Bers \cite{B} and Krushkal \cite{Kr1, Kr2} about uniqueness of a conformal or spherical CR structure on the sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ of symmetric rank one space $H_\mathbb{F}^n$ over division algebra $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}\,,\mathbb{C}\,,\mathbb{H}\,,\text{or}\,\, \mathbb{O} $ compatible with the action of a discrete group $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$. Introducing a nilpotent Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet with a positive Lebesgue measure in the nilpotent geometry in $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n\setminus\{\infty\}$ and its stretching, we construct a non-rigid discrete $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic groups $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$ whose non-trivial deformations are induced by $G$-equivariant homeomorphisms of the space. Here we consider two situations: either the limit set $\Lambda(G)$ is the whole sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ or restrictions of such non-trivial deformations to components of the discontinuity set $\Omega(G)\subset \partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ are given by restrictions of $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic isometries. In both cases the demonstrated non-rigidity is related to non-ergodic dynamics of the discrete group action on the limit set which could be the whole sphere at infinity.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form structure by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>
