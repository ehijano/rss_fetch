      <title>Assessing Dynamic Connectedness in Global Supply Chain Infrastructure Portfolios: The Impact of Risk Factors and Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the risk factors around investing in global supply chain infrastructure: the energy market, investor sentiment, and global shipping costs. It presents portfolio strategies associated with dynamic risks. A time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model is used to study the spillover and interconnectedness of the risk factors for global supply chain infrastructure portfolios from January 5th, 2010, to June 29th, 2023, which are associated with a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indexes. The effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment strategy are calculated and compared before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The results of this study demonstrate that risk shocks influence the dynamic connectedness between global supply chain infrastructure portfolios and three risk factors and show the effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment outcomes. Portfolios with higher ESG scores exhibit stronger dynamic connectedness with other portfolios and factors. Net total directional connectedness indicates that West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI), and investor sentiment volatility index (VIX) consistently are net receivers of spillover shocks. A portfolio with a ticker GLFOX appears to be a time-varying net receiver and giver. The pairwise connectedness shows that WTI and VIX are mostly net receivers. Portfolios with tickers CSUAX, GII, and FGIAX are mostly net givers of spillover shocks. The COVID-19 outbreak changed the structure of dynamic connectedness on portfolios. The mean value of HR and HE indicates that the weights of long/short positions in investment strategy after the COVID-19 outbreak have undergone structural changes compared to the period before. The hedging ability of global supply chain infrastructure investment portfolios with higher ESG scores is superior.</description>

      <title>Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment randomisation, but give little indication of the mechanisms behind causal effects. Causal Mediation (CM) provides a framework to analyse mechanisms by identifying the average direct and indirect effects (CM effects), yet conventional CM methods require the relevant mediator is as-good-as-randomly assigned. When people choose the mediator based on costs and benefits (whether to visit a doctor, to attend university, etc.), this assumption fails and conventional CM analyses are at risk of bias. I propose a control function strategy that uses instrumental variation in mediator take-up costs, delivering unbiased direct and indirect effects when selection is driven by unobserved gains. The method identifies CM effects via the marginal effect of the mediator, with parametric or semi-parametric estimation that is simple to implement in two stages. Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment reveals a substantial portion of the Medicaid lottery's effect on self-reported health and happiness flows through increased healthcare usage -- an effect that a conventional CM analysis would mistake. This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when an initial treatment is quasi-randomly assigned, but the mediator is not, as is common in natural experiments.</description>

      <title>Weak Identification in Peer Effects Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that some phenomena are social: for example, individuals' smoking habits often correlate with those of their peers. Such correlations can have a variety of explanations, such as direct contagion or shared socioeconomic circumstances. The network linear-in-means model is a workhorse statistical model which incorporates these peer effects by including average neighborhood characteristics as regressors. Although the model's parameters are identifiable under mild structural conditions on the network, it remains unclear whether identification ensures reliable estimation in the "infill" asymptotic setting, where a single network grows in size. We show that when covariates are i.i.d. and the average network degree of nodes increases with the population size, standard estimators suffer from bias or slow convergence rates due to asymptotic collinearity induced by network averaging. As an alternative, we demonstrate that linear-in-sums models, which are based on aggregate rather than average neighborhood characteristics, do not exhibit such issues as long as the network degrees have some nontrivial variation, a condition satisfied by most network models.</description>

      <title>Functional Factor Regression with an Application to Electricity Price Curve Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a function-on-function linear regression model for time-dependent curve data that is consistently estimated by imposing factor structures on the regressors. An integral operator based on cross-covariances identifies two components for each functional regressor: a predictive low-dimensional component, along with associated factors that are guaranteed to be correlated with the dependent variable, and an infinite-dimensional component that has no predictive power. In order to consistently estimate the correct number of factors for each regressor, we introduce a functional eigenvalue difference test. While conventional estimators for functional linear models fail to converge in distribution, we establish asymptotic normality, making it possible to construct confidence bands and conduct statistical inference. The model is applied to forecast electricity price curves in three different energy markets. Its prediction accuracy is found to be comparable to popular machine learning approaches, while providing statistically valid inference and interpretable insights into the conditional correlation structures of electricity prices.</description>

      <title>Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon in High-Dimensional Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel sparse latent factor modeling framework using sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA) to analyze the co-movements of high-dimensional panel data over time. Unlike existing methods based on sparse PCA, which assume sparsity in the loading matrices, our approach posits sparsity in the factor processes while allowing non-sparse loadings. This is motivated by the fact that financial returns typically exhibit universal and non-sparse exposure to market factors. Unlike the commonly used $\ell_1$-relaxation in sparse PCA, the proposed sparse APCA employs a truncated power method to estimate the leading sparse factor and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases under $\ell_0$-constraints. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. We establish the consistency of our estimators under mild conditions as both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $T$ grow. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we apply our method to daily S&amp;P 500 stock returns (2004--2016) and identify nine risk factors influencing the stock market.</description>
