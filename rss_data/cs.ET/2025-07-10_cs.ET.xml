      <title>Discrete Beamforming Optimization for RISs with a Limited Phase Range and Amplitude Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user equipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by phase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase range. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal solution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to converge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming the exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization framework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar quantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended amplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric projections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the performance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case with continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing the number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains, regardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide phase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range R is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and sensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal algorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for discrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.</description>

      <title>Analysing semantic data storage in Distributed Ledger Technologies for Data Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants. To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public, private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous AI-based Cybersecurity Framework for Critical Infrastructure: Real-Time Threat Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure systems, including energy grids, healthcare facilities, transportation networks, and water distribution systems, are pivotal to societal stability and economic resilience. However, the increasing interconnectivity of these systems exposes them to various cyber threats, including ransomware, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This paper examines cybersecurity vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, highlighting the threat landscape, attack vectors, and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mitigating these risks. We propose a hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity framework to enhance real-time vulnerability detection, threat modelling, and automated remediation. This study also addresses the complexities of adversarial AI, regulatory compliance, and integration. Our findings provide actionable insights to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure systems against emerging cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Quantum Executor: A Unified Interface for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing evolves from theoretical promise to practical deployment, the demand for robust, portable, and scalable tools for quantum software experimentation is growing. This paper introduces Quantum Executor, a backend-agnostic execution engine designed to orchestrate quantum experiments across heterogeneous platforms. Quantum Executor provides a declarative and modular interface that decouples experiment design from backend execution, enabling seamless interoperability and code reuse across diverse quantum and classical resources. Key features include support for asynchronous and distributed execution, customizable execution strategies and a unified API for managing quantum experiments. We illustrate its applicability through two life-like usage scenarios such as automated benchmarking and hybrid validation, discussing its capacity to streamline quantum development. We conclude by discussing current limitations and outlining a roadmap for future enhancements.</description>

      <title>Hedge Funds on a Swamp: Analyzing Patterns, Vulnerabilities, and Defense Measures in Blockchain Bridges [Experiment, Analysis &amp; Benchmark]</title>

Abstract: Blockchain bridges have become essential infrastructure for enabling interoperability across different blockchain networks, with more than $24B monthly bridge transaction volume. However, their growing adoption has been accompanied by a disproportionate rise in security breaches, making them the single largest source of financial loss in Web3. For cross-chain ecosystems to be robust and sustainable, it is essential to understand and address these vulnerabilities. In this study, we present a comprehensive systematization of blockchain bridge design and security. We define three bridge security priors, formalize the architectural structure of 13 prominent bridges, and identify 23 attack vectors grounded in real-world blockchain exploits. Using this foundation, we evaluate 43 representative attack scenarios and introduce a layered threat model that captures security failures across source chain, off-chain, and destination chain components.
  Our analysis at the static code and transaction network levels reveals recurring design flaws, particularly in access control, validator trust assumptions, and verification logic, and identifies key patterns in adversarial behavior based on transaction-level traces. To support future development, we propose a decision framework for bridge architecture design, along with defense mechanisms such as layered validation and circuit breakers. This work provides a data-driven foundation for evaluating bridge security and lays the groundwork for standardizing resilient cross-chain infrastructure.</description>
