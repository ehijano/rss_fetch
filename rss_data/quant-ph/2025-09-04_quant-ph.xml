      <title>Quantum aspects of the classical Maxwell's equations in free space from the perspective of the correspondence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the advent of Quantum Mechanics' 100th anniversary, we wrote this review paper in order to present a discussion that addresses the foundations of this theory. And since the creation of this Mechanics and other quantum theories was guided by correspondence principles that needed to be identified between them and other well-established physical theories, this paper will be devoted to discussing the correspondence between these quantum theories and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. More precisely, what we will do throughout this paper is discuss how the Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in free space and the stronger formulation of the correspondence principle already pointed, together, to the basis of a Quantum Mechanics that was only be formulated half a century later. And, in order to make this very clear, we will show that the quantum-mechanical description of a photon can already be identified, simply, by manipulating Maxwell's equations in free space with mathematical resources that, for instance, were already well known before the advent of Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>\textit{In Silico} Benchmarking of Detectable Byzantine Agreement in Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication resources offer significant advantages for fault-tolerant distributed protocols, particularly in Byzantine Agreement (BA), where reliability against adversarial interference is essential. Quantum Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) enables consensus protocols that surpass classical limitations by leveraging entangled quantum states. In this work, we focus on the practical realization of QDBA using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs, the simplest maximally entangled quantum resources, making the protocol experimentally accessible across current quantum hardware platforms. We present a comprehensive computational study of the EPRQDBA protocol under realistic quantum network conditions, utilizing the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator to evaluate the performance and robustness of the protocol. Our simulations systematically explore the protocol's parameter space --including variations in network size, traitorous node count, the amount of entanglement consumed in the protocol, and physically motivated noise models tailored specifically for superconducting and photonic qubit technologies. Through extensive numerical experiments, we provide insights into how these physically realistic parameters impact protocol performance, establishing critical thresholds and optimal operational regimes for experimental implementations. This work bridges theoretical advances in quantum consensus protocols with practical network implementations, offering a concrete reference for experimentalists. Our findings serve as a guideline for evaluating and optimizing QDBA implementations in realistic, noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous approximation of multiple degenerate states using a single neural network quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states (NQS) excel at approximating ground states of quantum many-body systems, but approximating all states of a degenerate manifold is nevertheless computationally expensive. We propose a single-trunk multi-head (ST-MH) NQS ensemble that share a feature extracting trunk while attaching lightweight heads for each target state. Using a cost function which also has an orthogonality term, we derive exact analytic gradients and overlap derivatives needed to train ST-MH within standard variational Monte Carlo (VMC) workflows. We prove that ST-MH can represent every degenerate eigenstate exactly whenever the feature map of latent width $h$, augmented with a constant, has column space containing the linear span of the targets' log-moduli and (chosen) phase branches together with the constant on the common support where all states are non-vanishing. Under this condition, ST-MH reduces the parameter count and can reduce the leading VMC cost by a factor equal to the degeneracy $K$ relative to other algorithms when $K$ is modest and in trunk dominated regimes. As a numerical proof-of-principle, we validate and benchmark the ST-MH approach on the frustrated spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model at the Majumdar-Ghosh point on periodic ring lattices of up to 8 sites. By obtaining the momentum eigenstates, we demonstrate that ST-MH attains high fidelity and energy accuracy across degenerate ground state manifolds while using significantly lower computing resources. Lastly we provide a qualitative computational cost analysis which incentivise the applicability of the ST-MH ensemble under certain criteria on the latent width.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Optimization for the Fault-Tolerance Era: Do We Have to Start from Scratch?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made significant advancements in the last years in both hardware and software. Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise. Many optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects thereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling quantum applications from currently considered small research examples to industrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum circuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic qubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits already for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that reduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is essential. This raises the question, whether we need to start from scratch, or whether current state-of-the-art optimization techniques can be used as a basis for this. To approach this question, this work investigates the effects of different optimization passes on a representative selection of quantum circuits. Since hardly any tools to automatically design and evaluate FTQC quantum circuits exist yet, we utilize resource estimation to compare the (potential) benefits gained by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization to estimated FTQC resource requirements. The results indicate that, indeed, the estimated resource requirements for FTQC can be improved by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization techniques. At the same time, more detailed investigations show what techniques lead to more benefits for FTQC compared to others, providing guidelines for the transfer of NISQ optimization techniques to the FTQC era.</description>

      <title>Magnetic noise in macroscopic quantum spatial superposition induced by inverted harmonic oscillator potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Stern-Gerlach type matter-wave interferometer where an inhomogeneous magnetic field couples to an embedded spin in a nanoparticle to create spatial superpositions. Employing a sequence of harmonic and inverted harmonic oscillator potentials created by external magnetic fields, we aim to enhance the one-dimensional superposition of a nanodiamond with mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg to $\sim 1 \mu$m. Such matter-wave interferometers have diverse applications, including entanglement of adjacent interferometers mediated by Standard Model and beyond-Standard Model fields, precision tests of the equivalence principle, quantum sensing, and laboratory probes of the quantum nature of spacetime. However, random fluctuations of the magnetic field stochastically perturbs the interferometer paths and induce dephasing. We quantitatively estimate the susceptibility of the interferometer to white noise arising from magnetic-field fluctuations. Constraining the dephasing rate $\Gamma$ to be low enough that the final coherence $e^{-\Gamma \tau}\leq 0.1$ (where $\tau$ is the experimental time duration), we obtain the following bounds on the noise to signal ratios: $\delta \eta_\text{IHP}/\eta_\text{IHP}\lesssim 10^{-13}$, where $\eta_\text{IHP}$ is the magnetic field curvature that gives rise to the inverted harmonic potential, and $\delta \eta_\text{HP}/\eta_\text{HP}\lesssim 10^{-6}$, where $\eta_\text{HP}$ is the linear magnetic field gradient that gives rise to the harmonic potential. For such tiny fluctuations, we demonstrate that the Humpty-Dumpty problem arising from a mismatch in position and momentum does not cause a loss in contrast of the interferometer. Further, we show that constraining the dephasing rate leads to stricter bounds on the noise parameters than enforcing a contrast threshold, indicating that good dephasing control ensures high interferometric contrast.</description>

      <title>The Munich Quantum Software Stack: Connecting End Users, Integrating Diverse Quantum Technologies, Accelerating HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly in hardware and algorithms, but broad accessibility demands a comprehensive, efficient, unified software stack. Such a stack must flexibly span diverse hardware and evolving algorithms, expose usable programming models for experts and non-experts, manage resources dynamically, and integrate seamlessly with classical High-Performance Computing (HPC). As quantum systems increasingly act as accelerators in hybrid workflows -- ranging from loosely to tightly coupled -- few full-featured implementations exist despite many proposals.
  We introduce the Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS), a modular, open-source, community-driven ecosystem for hybrid quantum-classical applications. MQSS's multi-layer architecture executes high-level applications on heterogeneous quantum back ends and coordinates their coupling with classical workloads. Core elements include front-end adapters for popular frameworks and new programming approaches, an HPC-integrated scheduler, a powerful MLIR-based compiler, and a standardized hardware abstraction layer, the Quantum Device Management Interface (QDMI). While under active development, MQSS already provides mature concepts and open-source components that form the basis of a robust quantum computing software stack, with a forward-looking design that anticipates fault-tolerant quantum computing, including varied qubit encodings and mid-circuit measurements.</description>

      <title>Improving Hardware Requirements for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing by Optimizing Error Budget Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in quantum computing in recent years, executing quantum circuits for practical problems remains challenging due to error-prone quantum hardware. Hence, quantum error correction becomes essential but induces significant overheads in qubits and execution time, often by orders of magnitude. Obviously, these overheads must be reduced. Since many quantum applications can tolerate some noise, end users can provide a maximum tolerated error, the error budget, to be considered during compilation and execution. This error budget, or, more precisely, its distribution, can be a key factor in achieving the overhead reduction. Conceptually, an error-corrected quantum circuit can be divided into different parts that each have a specific purpose. Errors can happen in any of these parts and their errors sum up to the mentioned error budget, but how to distribute it among them actually constitutes a degree of freedom. This work is based on the idea that some of the circuit parts can compensate for errors more efficiently than others. Consequently, these parts should contribute more to satisfy the total error budget than the parts where it is more costly. However, this poses the challenge of finding optimal distributions. We address this challenge not only by providing general guidelines on distributing the error budget, but also a method that automatically determines resource-efficient distributions for arbitrary circuits by training a machine learning model on an accumulated dataset. The approach is evaluated by analyzing the machine learning model's predictions on so far unseen data, reducing the estimated space-time costs for more than 75% of the considered quantum circuits, with an average reduction of 15.6%, including cases without improvement, and a maximum reduction of 77.7%.</description>

      <title>Reversing non-Hermitian skin accumulation with a non-local transverse switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetrically directed couplings in non-Hermitian systems cause directional amplification that leads to boundary skin state accumulation. However, counter-intuitively, the direction of accumulation may not follow that of the directed couplings. In this work, we demonstrate new mechanisms where this accumulation can be systematically reversed without modifying the couplings at all, just by adjusting the system size or boundary conditions in a different, transverse direction. Moreover, the reversed skin dynamics can be made very robust by suppressing the amplification in the original non-reversed direction. We motivate our approach through a series of warm-up models, culminating in a designed non-Hermitian Kagome lattice whereby wavepacket simulations demonstrate how robust reversed skin dynamics can be switched on/off in a non-local transverse manner. Our findings highlight how the non-trivial entanglement between the spectral loops of different PBC directions can be harnessed as a directional amplification switch, paving the way for new avenues of non-Hermitian sensing and lasing.</description>

      <title>Quantum DPLL and Generalized Constraints in Iterative Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Too often, quantum computer scientists seek to create new algorithms entirely fresh from new cloth when there are extensive and optimized classical algorithms that can be generalized wholesale. At the same time, one may seek to maintain classical advantages of performance and runtime bounds, while enabling potential quantum improvement. Hybrid quantum algorithms tap into this potential, and here we explore a class of hybrid quantum algorithms called Iterative Quantum Algorithms (IQA) that are closely related to classical greedy or local search algorithms, employing a structure where the quantum computer provides information that leads to a simplified problem for future iterations. Specifically, we extend these algorithms beyond past results that considered primarily quadratic problems to arbitrary k-local Hamiltonians, proposing a general framework that incorporates logical inference in a fundamental way. As an application we develop a hybrid quantum version of the well-known classical Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm for satisfiability problems, which embeds IQAs within a complete backtracking based tree search framework. Our results also provide a general framework for handling problems with hard constraints in IQAs. We further show limiting cases of the algorithms where they reduce to classical algorithms, and provide evidence for regimes of quantum improvement.</description>

      <title>Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>

      <title>Tableau-Based Framework for Efficient Logical Quantum Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds the promise of solving problems intractable for classical computers, but practical large-scale quantum computation requires error correction to protect against errors. Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) enables reliable execution of quantum algorithms, yet they often demand substantial physical qubit overhead. Resource-efficient FTQC architectures minimize the number of physical qubits required, saving more than half compared to other architectures, but impose constraints that introduce up to 4.7$\times$ higher runtime overhead. In this paper, we present TQC, a \underline{T}ableau-based \underline{Q}uantum \underline{C}ompiler framework that minimizes FTQC runtime overhead without requiring additional physical qubits. By leveraging operation reorderability and latency hiding through parallel execution, TQC reduces FTQC runtime overhead by \textbf{2.57$\times$} on average.
  Furthermore, FTQC circuits often contain millions of gates, leading to substantial compilation overhead. To address this, we optimize the core data structure, the tableau, used in stabilizer formalism. We provide two tailored versions of the Tableau data type, each designed for different usage scenarios. These optimizations yield an overall performance improvement of more than \textbf{1000$\times$} compared to state-of-the-art FTQC optimization tools.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Decoherence in the Generation of Optical Schr\"odinger Cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use cavity Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of optical photons. We predict that this should make it possible to generate states with relatively large mean photon numbers. With existing technology, mean photon numbers around 30 seem feasible. The main limitation is photon loss during the process, which generates the state. The ability to tune the strength of the photon loss caused by atomic spontaneous emission makes it possible to have little decoherence despite significant photon loss during the generation of the state.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Dimensionality of Continuous Variable States From Phase-Space Quasi-Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimensionality of entanglement is a core tenet of quantum information processing, especially quantum communication and computation. While it is natural to think of this dimensionality in finite dimensional systems, many of the implementations harnessing high Schmidt numbers are actually based on discretising the observables of continuous variable systems. For those instances, a core question is whether directly utilizing the toolbox of continuous variable quantum information processing leads to better and more robust characterisations of entanglement dimensionality in infinite dimensional systems. We affirmatively answer this question by introducing Schmidt number witnesses for CV systems, based directly on covariances of infinite dimensional Bloch operators that are readily accessible in experiments. We show that the direct estimation leads to increased robustness and versatility compared to first discretising the system and using canonical discrete variable techniques, which provides strong motivation for further developments of genuine CV methods for the characterization of entanglement dimensionality, as well as for their implementation in experiments.</description>

      <title>Coupling of a nuclear transition to a Surface Acoustic Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical modulation of recoilless nuclear transitions allows the dynamic control of {\gamma}-ray emission and absorption. Accessing modulation frequencies well above the nuclear linewidth enables coherent manipulation of the nuclear response. Here we demonstrate such control by coupling a film of enriched 57Fe to a 97.9 MHz surface acoustic wave, which is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the nuclear linewidth. The mechanical drive produces a comb of absorption sidebands in the M\"ossbauer spectrum, consistent with coherent phase modulation of the nuclear transition. This constitutes the fastest phonon-driven control of M\"ossbauer resonances to date. Our solid-state, monolithic platform establishes a new interface between nuclear transitions and high-frequency acoustics, with applications in {\gamma}-ray quantum optics and precision nuclear spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Geodesics of Quantum Feature Maps on the space of Quantum Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a quantum feature is an essential step in quantum machine learning. There have been many proposed encoding schemes and proposed techniques to test the efficacy of a scheme. From the perspective of information retention, this paper considers the smooth Riemannian geometry structure of a point cloud and how an encoding scheme deforms this geometry once mapped to the space of quantum operators, $\SU(2^N)$. However, a Riemannian manifold structure of the codomain of a quantum feature map has yet to be formalized. Using a ground-up approach, this manuscript mathematically establishes a Riemannian geometry for a general class of Hamiltonian quantum feature maps that are induced from a Euclidean embedded manifold. For this ground-up approach, we first derive a closed form of a vector space and a respective metric, and prove there is a 1-1 correspondence from geodesics on the embedded manifold to the codomain of the encoding scheme. We then rigorously derive closed form equations to calculate curvature. The paper ends with an example with a subset of the Poincar\'e half-plane and two well-used feature maps.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum memory leveraging slow-light and gradient-echo duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a hybrid quantum memory that combines Gradient Echo Memory (GEM) and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) protocols for reversible mapping between light and atomic coherence. By leveraging GEM and EIT complementarity, we realize time-to-frequency and frequency-to-time conversion mechanisms for spectro-temporal modes. This capability provides a versatile tool for quantum communication, where coherent frequency-time conversion enhances network interoperability. In addition, the protocol may enable fundamental studies of atomic coherence, including investigations of Rydberg polaritons and mapping of single Rydberg excitations and ionic impurities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for reconstructing an arbitrary high-dimensional unitary transformation without detecting the qudit that it transforms. We demonstrate the method using orbital angular momentum states of light. Our method relies on quantum interference enabled by path identity of undetected photons. The method is practically useful when suitable detectors are not available for the qudit on which the unitary transformation works.</description>

      <title>Proposal for High-Dimensional Entanglement Swapping with Linear Optics and Ancillary Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping are fundamental building blocks for realizing global quantum networks. Both protocols have been extensively studied and experimentally demonstrated using two-dimensional qubit systems. Their implementation in high-dimensional (HD) systems offers significant advantages, such as enhanced noise resilience, greater robustness against eavesdropping, and increased information capacity. Generally, HD photonic entanglement swapping requires ancilla photons or strong nonlinear interactions. However, specific experimental implementations that are feasible with current technology remain elusive. Here, we present a linear optics-based setup for HD entanglement swapping for up to six dimensions using ancillary photons. This scheme is applicable to any photonic degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we present an experimental design for a four-dimensional implementation using hyper-entanglement, which includes the necessary preparation of the ancilla state and analysis of the resulting swapped state.</description>

      <title>Quasi-van Hove singularities informed approach improving DOS/pDOS predictions in GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an extension of the concept of Van Hoff singularities in order to explicitly use them in machine learning methods of models as a priori information. The claimed method becomes possible when, instead of directly calculating the density of quantum states, we operate with estimates obtained by machine learning methods. Then, determining additional information allows us to organize post-processing, which significantly improves the quality of model prediction. Analytically, the effect is similar to Van Hove singularities of high order due to the additional degree of degeneracy of the system. As a mechanism for redistributing information about the system, we propose regularization, which is close in meaning to taking into account Fisher information.</description>

      <title>QNPU: Quantum Network Processor Unit for Quantum Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, the need for scalable solutions to address large-scale computational problems has become critical. Quantum supercomputers are the next upcoming frontier by enabling multiple quantum processors to collaborate effectively to solve large-scale computational problems. The emergence of quantum supercomputers necessitates an efficient interface to manage the quantum communication protocols between quantum processors. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Network Processing Unit (QNPU), which enables quantum applications to efficiently scale beyond the capacity of individual quantum processors, serving as a critical building block for future quantum supercomputers. The QNPU works alongside the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in our decoupled processing units architecture, where the QPU handles local quantum operations while the QNPU manages quantum communication between nodes. We design a comprehensive instruction set architecture (ISA) for the QNPU with high-level communication protocol abstractions, implemented via micro-operations that manage EPR resources, quantum operations, and classical communication. To facilitate programming, we introduce DistQASM, which extends OpenQASM with distributed quantum operations. We then propose a microarchitecture featuring both scalar and superscalar QNPU designs to enhance performance for communication-intensive quantum workloads. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed QNPU design with distributed quantum workloads and demonstrate that the QNPU significantly improves the efficiency of communication between quantum nodes, paving the way for quantum supercomputing.</description>

      <title>From negligible to neglecton: making Ising anyons braiding universal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for achieving universal topological quantum computation using Ising anyons via braiding alone. Our approach builds on recent developments in non-semisimple topological quantum field theories in (2+1)-dimensions, which extend the traditional semisimple paradigm. While standard Ising anyons are limited to Clifford operations and thus not computationally universal, we show that their non-semisimple counterparts give rise to new anyon types we call \emph{neglectons}; adding a single neglecton to the traditional Ising theory enables universal quantum computation through braiding alone.
  The resulting braid group representations are unitary with respect to an indefinite Hermitian form, with the computational subspace embedded in a positive-definite sector. We identify a range of parameters for which the model supports universal gate sets and, notably, special values of the parameter $\alpha$ where the computational subspace decouples exactly from the negative-norm components of the Hilbert space. This leads to low-leakage, fully unitary evolution on the physical subspace and improved prospects for efficient gate compilation.</description>

      <title>Fluid Model of Schrodinger equation and derivation of the quantum potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is quite familiar that Schr\"{o}dinger equation can be rewritten in terms of fluid-type equations, called Madelung equations. However one term in these fluid equations, the so called `quantum potential` is quite complicated. Indeed, D\"{u}rr complains that the quantum potential is `neither simple nor natural` \cite{Durr1996}. Thus it may appear a hopeless task to imagine a fluid with such properties that would lead to the Madelung equations, and more specifically, to the quantum potential. We prove the opposite. We make a model with \textit{two} interacting fluids, instead of one. Then we consider a process of mutual diffusion between the fluids. This leads quite naturally to the Madelung fluid equations \textit{including} the quantum potential for one of the fluids. In addition, we model the particle as a point-like object, that moves inside this particular fluid. We require that it moves with the \textit{same} velocity as the \textit{local velocity of this fluid}. Then the guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics follows directly. From this equation we derive Born's rule. Our interpretation of that result is that \textit{the particle is part of the fluid, a kind of singularity in it}. Finally, we answer several possible objections against the model.</description>

      <title>Product-State Manifolds for M Quantum Systems with N Levels using the Fano form and the Induced Euclidean Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics separable states can be characterized as convex combinations of product states whereas non-separable states exhibit entanglement. Quantum entanglement has played a pivotal role in both theoretical investigations and practical applications within quantum information science. In this study, we explore the connection between product states and geometric structures, specifically manifolds and their associated geometric properties such as the first fundamental form (metric). We focus on the manifolds formed by the product states of M systems of N levels, examining the induced metric derived from the Euclidean metric. For elementary cases we will compute the Levi-Civita connection, and, where computationally tractable, the scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Treasure Hunt in Anonymous Graphs with Quantum Pebbles by Oblivious Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding a static treasure in anonymous graphs using oblivious agents and introduce a novel approach that leverages quantum information. In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable, and edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on stationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search. However, this classical approach is constrained by limited information transmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not sufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of quantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically emit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to the next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct path by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy enables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$ quantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the starting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\log D + \log \Delta)/(\log 1/\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success probability in a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ where $\delta = \cos^2(\frac{\pi}{2\Delta})$. We propose the use of quantum information as a guidance mechanism in anonymous graph search. We demonstrate that quantum pebbles can not only emulate the functionality of classical pebbles but can do so with improved efficiency, offering a promising direction for future quantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Control of molecular rotation in helium nanodroplets with an optical centrifuge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that the rotation of molecules embedded in helium nanodroplets can be controlled with an optical centrifuge, allowing for the study of molecular dynamics inside the strongly interacting many-body environment of superfluid helium at variable levels of rotational excitation. By doping the droplets with dimers of nitric oxide, (NO)$_2$, and measuring the degree of their centrifuge-induced alignment as a function of time, we show both the forced in-field rotation of molecules at arbitrary frequencies, as well as the field-free resonant rotation with a long nanosecond-scale decay. The ability to control and monitor the rotational dynamics of molecular rotors inside the superfluid environment may shed new light on superfluidity and the interaction of superfluids with defects at the atomic level.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Complexity in Many-body Systems from Positivity Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area laws describe how entanglement entropy scales and thus provide important necessary conditions for efficient quantum many-body simulation, but they do not, by themselves, yield a direct measure of computational complexity. Here we introduce a complementary framework based on $p$-particle positivity conditions from reduced density matrix (RDM) theory. These conditions form a hierarchy of $N$-representability constraints for an RDM to correspond to a valid $N$-particle quantum system, becoming exact when the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a convex combination of positive semidefinite $p$-particle operators. We prove a general complexity bound: if a quantum system is solvable with level-$p$ positivity independent of its size, then its entanglement complexity scales polynomially with order $p$. This theorem connects structural constraints on RDMs with computational tractability and provides a rigorous framework for certifying when many-body methods including RDM methods can efficiently simulate correlated quantum matter and materials.</description>

      <title>Zero-Error Nash Equilibrium: Harnessing Nonlocal Correlation in Incomplete Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claude Shannon's zero-error communication paradigm reshaped our understanding of fault-tolerant information transfer. Here, we adapt this notion into game theory with incomplete information. We ask: can players with private information coordinate on a Nash equilibrium with zero probability of error? We identify Bayesian games in which such coordination is impossible classically, yet achievable by harnessing Bell nonlocal correlations. We formalize this requirement as zero-error Nash equilibrium coordination, establishing a new bridge between information theory, game theory, and quantum nonlocality. Furthermore, we construct a tripartite Bayesian game that admits zero-error Nash equilibrium coordination with genuine entanglement, and a two-player game where a stronger notion of coordination can be achieved using every two-qubit pure entangled state except the maximally one. Crucially, the advantage persists under experimentally relevant noise, demonstrating nonlocality as a robust resource for near-zero error decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum circuits generate states that depend on the measurement results obtained during circuit execution. To date such a quantum computing model has mainly been implemented with qubit-based superconducting hardware utilizing reset operations and classical logic. Here we develop a model of optical reset by using time-bin self-looped interferometers demonstrated in recent experiments. Synchronizing the optical reset with a simple classical device storing history of measurement results allows one to decrease uncertainty of future measurements, which suggests unprecedented flexibility in constructing dynamical circuits on optical platforms. We reveal and characterize information flow in the proposed reset model with distinct information-theoretic measures.</description>

      <title>Programmable Quantum Matter: Heralding Large Cluster States in Driven Inhomogeneous Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom-like emitters in solids are promising platforms for quantum sensing and information processing, but inhomogeneities in the emitter fine structure complicate quantum control. We present a framework that leverages this diversity to reduce the resources for generating optically heralded spin cluster states across $N_q$ emitters from the conventional order $O(N_q)$ to $O(1)$ in ensembles of $N_q \sim 10$-$100$. An optimized pulse sequence simultaneously corrects pulse-length and detuning errors, achieving single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ for errors (normalized relative to the Rabi drive strength) up to 0.3, while maintaining fidelities above $99\%$ for errors as large as 0.4. Applied as a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling protocol to the dominant noise spectrum of silicon-vacancy centers in diamond, it enhances ensemble coherence times by over $7\times$ compared to interleaved bang-bang based CPMG. For state-of-the-art dilution refrigerators, global resonant optimal decoupling across $N_q$ spins sharply reduces heating, addressing the trade-off between the spin coherence and scaling to $N_q \gg 1$. We further introduce a modified single-photon entanglement protocol with an efficient algorithm for deterministic entanglement compilation. Depending on the decoupling time window, our method yields order $O(10^2$-$10^4)$ more entanglement links than bang-bang sequences, with theoretical guarantees of order $\Omega(N_q)$ unique links, improvable by control tuning. Together, these techniques provide scalable tools - including global control, phase denoising, remote entanglement, and compilation - for robust quantum computing architectures with heterogeneous spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Orbital-Angular-Momentum Selectivity in Electron Transmission and Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality-induced orbital-angular-momentum selectivity (CIOAMS) in electron transmission and scattering processes is investigated. Polarization of the OAM of an electron traversing chiral media is first studied via electronic wavepacket propagation using the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Next, spatial resolution of wavepackets carrying opposite OAM, following scattering from a corrugated surface is demonstrated. This suggests that OAM may play a significant role in the mechanisms underlying chirality induced spin selectivity, measured for electrons crossing chiral media in setups involving Mott polarimetry. Our results highlight the potential to exploit CIOAMS in innovative emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Theory of Deficiency and Operational Applications in Subchannel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum resource theory is to provide operational meaning to quantum resources that offer distinct advantages over the convex set of resource-free states in specific physical tasks. We propose a novel framework to define the resource deficiency of a given state relative to the set of maximal resource states in physical tasks. The proposed geometric measure satisfies this framework's conditions for both quantum coherence and entanglement, and it precisely quantifies the minimal disadvantage of a given state compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination under certain conditions. These extensions and new interpretations broaden the scope of quantum resource theories and provide more comprehensive operational interpretations.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer Benchmarking: An Explorative Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing (QC) continues to evolve in hardware and software, measuring progress in this complex and diverse field remains a challenge. To track progress, uncover bottlenecks, and evaluate community efforts, benchmarks play a crucial role. But which benchmarking approach best addresses the diverse perspectives of QC stakeholders? We conducted the most comprehensive systematic literature review of this area to date, combining NLP-based clustering with expert analysis to develop a novel taxonomy and definitions for QC benchmarking, aligned with the quantum stack and its stakeholders. In addition to organizing benchmarks in distinct hardware, software, and application focused categories, our taxonomy hierarchically classifies benchmarking protocols in clearly defined subcategories. We develop standard terminology and map the interdependencies of benchmark categories to create a holistic, unified picture of the quantum benchmarking landscape. Our analysis reveals recurring design patterns, exposes research gaps, and clarifies how benchmarking methods serve different stakeholders. By structuring the field and providing a common language, our work offers a foundation for coherent benchmark development, fairer evaluation, and stronger cross-disciplinary collaboration in QC.</description>

      <title>Generation and manipulation of photon number wave packets in photonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters inside optical cavities can create not only fixed photon number states but also photon number wave packets, which are states with a finite photon number distribution that oscillates in time. These states emerge when the emitter is driven by an external field while coupled to the cavity. We show that by rapidly changing the driving strength, new wave packets can be generated, allowing multiple packets to coexist and evolve independently. We classify the resulting wave packet behavior into distinct dynamical subclasses between which we choose through the choice of relevant parameters. Based on this understanding, we develop simple and robust protocols to generate a specified number of photon number wave packets on demand. We propose that the rich dynamics can be experimentally investigated by merely measuring the mean photon number.</description>

      <title>Simple explanation of apparent Bell nonlocality of unentangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wang et al. [Science Advances, 1 Aug 2025 Vol 11, Issue 31] recently reported an experiment that they interpret as demonstrating a violation of Bell's inequality using unentangled photons. Such a claim is highly controversial, since it is well established that product states cannot surpass the bounds set by local hidden variable models. In this manuscript, we analyze the essential features of the experiment through simplified, idealized scenarios. Our analysis shows that the apparent violation of Bell's inequality originates from two key elements: postselection and an unconventional normalization procedure. These steps produce quantities that formally mimic Bell-type correlations but lack the operational meaning required in a genuine Bell test. We therefore argue that the reported violation does not demonstrate nonlocality without entanglement, but rather reflects a misinterpretation of otherwise valid and interesting multiphoton interference effects.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dynamical assumptions in Tsirelson inequality tests of non-classicality in harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Macrorealism" posits that a system possesses definite properties at all times and that we can discover these properties, in principle, without disturbing the system's subsequent behaviour. The Leggett-Garg inequalities are derived under these assumptions and are readily violated by standard quantum mechanics, thereby providing a scheme to test whether demonstrably macroscopic systems can exhibit quantum coherence. Unfortunately, Leggett-Garg tests suffer from the ineludible clumsiness loophole - the difficulty of proving that sequential measurements have not inadvertently disturbed the system. The recently uncovered Tsirelson inequality is derived from the simple dynamical assumption of uniform precession, obeyed by many classical systems, and requires only single-time measurements. However, Tsirelson inequality violations could be explained by a macrorealistic system that merely breaks the dynamical assumption, rather than genuine quantum behaviour. By carrying out a quantum-mechanical analysis of the Tsirelson inequality in the harmonic oscillator, we develop a protocol to rule out this possibility by assessing generalised conditions of uniform precession. We show that various measures of uniform precession, some of which related to Leggett-Garg quantities, are satisfied well enough that the presence of quantum-mechanical interference terms must be implied. We derive several incidental mathematical results relating to maximally-violating states, concerning dwell time, crossing number and probability currents, and also consider a group theoretic analysis of the Tsirelson operator.</description>

      <title>Scalable Entanglement Detection in Quantum Systems via Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum technology and enables quantum devices to outperform classical systems in terms of performance. However, detecting entanglement in high-dimensional systems remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the number of particles. In this work, we use machine learning to classify entangled states and separable states, focusing on the application of classical Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA). By adapting classical statistical learning techniques to quantum state discriminant analysis, we present the theoretical foundations, a practical implementation strategy, and the advantages of FLDA in this context. We systematically evaluate the performance of this method on different quantum states and demonstrate its effectiveness as a tool for efficient quantum state classification. Finally, we investigate multi-qubit quantum states with high accuracy and classify these states.</description>

Abstract: We give a review of concepts related to connection of classical and quantum theories, from the phase space perspective. Quantum theory is described by non-commutative operators of coordinates and momenta, results in values having a certain probability, hence resembling the classical statistical theory in which coordinates and momenta are well measurable quantities. The search is for the classical object best describing the quantum state, while the physical observables of the quantum theories are operators.</description>

      <title>Cat-state-like non-Gaussian entanglement in magnon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons can serve as a bridge between spin, phonon, and photon systems, which renders them suitable for constructing hybrid systems. An important application of such hybrid systems is generating entanglement between different platforms. As magnons can support a broad variety of states, e.g., Fock states, squeezed states, or coherent states, and hybrid states can be produced with cavities or spins, there are many different kinds of entangled states in magnon systems. In this paper, we consider the entanglement of cat-state-like throughout states, which can be generated in magnon systems with parametric pumps beyond the parametric stable intensities. However, estimating the entanglement in such states is challenging due to their multiphoton and non-Gaussian properties. Here, we apply a modular variable-based projection, which maps the catlike states to spin states, preserving the encoded information. After the projection, Bell's inequality is employed to detect the entanglement in the effective spin states. Our numerical analysis provides the conditions for generating catlike entanglement in magnon systems and can be conveniently extended to other entangled states that may be formed by magnon and spin systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Analytic Solution for the Quantum Transport of Structured Matter-Waves in Magnetic Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a closed-form analytic solution for the propagation of an arbitrary charged scalar state in a non-uniform magnetic field. The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry triggers rich dynamics incompatible with a simple Bohmian trajectory interpretation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a powerful tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, critical for designing next-generation OAM-based experiments.</description>

      <title>An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-Free Quantum Protocol for Thermal Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and noise-resilient quantum algorithm for computing both zero- and finite-temperature Green's functions, requiring no ancillas and relying only on native time evolution and measurements readily available on current platforms. Assuming parity symmetry of the system, as in the Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models, we construct symmetric and antisymmetric thermal states and employ a tailored quench spectroscopy scheme to recover the exact real and imaginary parts of two-point time correlators. Green's functions are then reconstructed through efficient signal analysis. The protocol is theoretically efficient, experimentally accessible, and directly applicable to both digital quantum computers and analog quantum simulators. Beyond Green's functions, the same framework extends naturally to out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC). This work highlights a practical path toward probing finite-temperature dynamics of strongly correlated quantum systems on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Suppression of Gas Phase Chemical Reactions inside a Dark Infrared Cavity: O$_{2}$ + 2NO$\to$ 2NO$_{2}$ as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to slow down chemical reactions using a seemingly simple setup reactions confined within a cavity formed by two parallel mirrors is fascinating. However, theory and experiment have not yet fully converged. In this work, we provide the conditions and guidelines for selecting reactions that can be suppressed in a dark cavity. The primary requirement is that the reaction's potential energy surface must contain two saddle points (and not one saddle point as required for enhancement). This condition enables a reduction in the reaction rate. Specifically, we demonstrate that the reaction rate of O$_{2}$ + 2NO$\to$ 2NO$_{2}$ can be suppressed by a dark cavity composed of two parallel mirrors. We show that the suppression of the reaction rate depends on the distance between the mirrors, which determines the cavity parameters, and on the number of molecules in the transition state configuration that simultaneously interact with the cavity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a disruptive technology that is expected to offer significant advantages in many critical fields (e.g. drug discovery and cryptography). The security of information processed by such machines is therefore paramount. Currently, modest Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are available. The goal of this work is to identify a practical, heuristic methodology to evaluate security properties, such as secrecy and integrity, while using quantum processors owned by potentially untrustworthy providers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear spins near group-IV defects in diamond are promising candidates for quantum memories in quantum network applications. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity control of a single $^{13}$C nuclear spin coupled to a tin-vacancy (SnV) center in diamond. We perform a combination of optical and microwave pumping to achieve initialization into a combined electro-nuclear spin state with a fidelity of $99.74(3)\,\%$. Harnessing a superconducting waveguide for radio-frequency driving, we demonstrate precise nuclear spin control: Ramsey measurements reveal a coherence time of $T_2^* = 1.5(1)\,$milliseconds, and we use dynamical decoupling to extend it to $1.35(3)\,$seconds. We perform randomized benchmarking, yielding a single-qubit gate fidelity of $99.92(1)\,\%$. This demonstrates a coherent spin-photon system with promising properties for quantum network nodes.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonian for an off-resonantly driven qubit-cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of driven light-matter interactions is essential for quantum technologies, where natural and synthetic atoms are used to store and process quantum information, mediate interactions between bosonic modes, and enable nonlinear operations. In systems subject to multi-tone drives, however, the theoretical description becomes challenging and existing models cannot quantitatively reproduce the experimental data. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that retains slowly rotating terms, providing a general framework for accurately describing driven dynamics across platforms. As a concrete application, we validate the theory in circuit QED, where it quantitatively reproduces experimentally measured ac Stark shifts and captures key interactions such as two-mode squeezing and beam-splitting. Our results establish a broadly applicable tool to engineer driven interactions in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>Detection of noise correlations in two qubit systems by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine-learning assisted quantum sensing protocol to classify spatial and temporal correlations of classical noise affecting two ultrastrongly coupled qubits. We consider six distinct classes of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various forms of noise are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. Our approach achieves $\gtrsim 86\%$ accuracy in classification providing a near-perfect discrimination between Markovian and non-Markovian noise. The method requires minimal experimental resources, relying on a simple driving scheme providing three inputs to a shallow neural network with no need of measuring time-series data or real-time monitoring. The machine-learning data analysis acquires information from non-idealities of the coherent protocol highlighting how combining these techniques may significantly improve the characterization of quantum-hardware.</description>

      <title>An angular momentum approach to quantum insertion errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum insertion errors are a class of errors that increase the number of qubits in a quantum system. Despite a wealth of research on classical insertion errors, there has been limited progress towards a general framework for correcting quantum insertion errors. We detail a quantum error correction protocol that can correct single insertion errors on a class of gapped permutation-invariant codes. We provide a simple two-stage syndrome extraction protocol that yields a two-bit syndrome, by measuring the total angular momentum and its projection along the $z$-axis (modulo the code gap) of the post-insertion state. We demonstrate that these measurements project the state onto a new codespace, and we detail a teleportation protocol to map the projected state back to a permutation-invariant code on the desired number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Universal representation of the long-range entanglement in the family of Toric Code states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the long range entanglement is a universal characteristic of topological quantum states belonging to the same class, a suitable mathematical representation of the long range entanglement has to be also universal. In this Letter, we introduce such a representation for the family of Toric Code states by using Kitaev's Ladders as building blocks. We consider Toric Code states corresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to qubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological constraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying graph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of Kitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric configurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the above universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is responsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states. Our result emphasizes in the capability of such non-local representations to describe topological order in ground-state wave functions of topological quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast single-photon interference with a dipole qubit in a nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stationary spectrum of individual dipole emitters in plasmonic nanocavities has been studied for a range of cavity geometries and dipole configurations. Less is known about the coherent dynamics of single photon creation in the nanocavity near field by an excited dipole. We address this gap by developing a Lorentzian kernel approximation that solves the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation that describes the coupled dipole-photon dynamics in the single-excitation manifold. Our approach encodes the broadband nature of the nanocavity field through a non-Markovian memory kernel, derived from macroscopic QED theory. For a two-level dipole near a metallic nanosphere, we show that the single photon probability density in frequency space evolves in strong coupling from an initially localized source at the qubit frequency into a Rabi doublet over a timescale governed by the kernel spectrum. This dynamical crossover is accompanied by the formation of single-photon interference patterns in frequency and time, propagating coherently over a timescale limited by the shape of kernel spectrum to $\sim 100-150$ fs, which is accessible to ultrafast spectroscopy. We also show that the stationary spectrum of the coupled system can be manipulated by driving the nanocavity field using coherent pulses with variable spectral bandwidth. Using single-photon pulses narrower than the kernel spectrum, the Rabi splitting in a system that supports strong coupling can be effectively removed. The applicability of our results to other dipole-nanocavity configurations is discussed and a general strong coupling criterion for nanocavities is formulated.</description>

      <title>Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds for Approximating Monomials via Optimal Quantum Tsallis Entropy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reveals a conceptually new connection from information theory to approximation theory via quantum algorithms for entropy estimation. Specifically, we provide an information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the approximate degree of the monomial $x^n$, compared to the analytic lower bounds shown in Newman and Rivlin (Aequ. Math. 1976) via Fourier analysis and in Sachdeva and Vishnoi (Found. Trends Theor. Comput. Sci. 2014) via the Markov brothers' inequality. This is done by relating the polynomial approximation of monomials to quantum Tsallis entropy estimation. This further implies a quantum algorithm that estimates to within additive error $\varepsilon$ the Tsallis entropy of integer order $q \geq 2$ of an unknown probability distribution $p$ or an unknown quantum state $\rho$, using $\widetilde \Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{q}\varepsilon})$ queries to the quantum oracle that produces a sample from $p$ or prepares a copy of $\rho$, improving the prior best $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ via the Shift test due to Ekert, Alves, Oi, Horodecki, Horodecki and Kwek (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantum entropy estimator with optimal query complexity (up to polylogarithmic factors) for all parameters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum-limited sub-Rayleigh identification of incoherent sources with arbitrary intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh diffraction limit imposes a fundamental restriction on the resolution of direct imaging systems, hindering the identification of incoherent optical sources, such as celestial bodies in astronomy and fluorophores in bioimaging. Recent advances in quantum sensing have shown that this limit can be circumvented through spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) and photon detection. Notably, the latter is a semi-classical detection strategy, being SPADE a linear transformation of the field and photon detection a measurement of intensity. However, the general optimality for arbitrary intensity distributions and bright sources remains unproven. In this work, we develop a general model for incoherent light with arbitrary intensity collected by passive, linear optical systems. We employ this framework to compute the quantum Chernoff exponent for generic incoherent-source discrimination problems, and we analyze several special cases, with particular focus on the subdiffraction regime for Gaussian point-spread functions. We show that, surprisingly, SPADE measurements do not always saturate the quantum Chernoff bound in the subdiffraction regime; the quantum optimality holds only when certain compatibility conditions, such as covariance matrix commutativity, are met. These findings suggest that collective measurements may actually be needed to achieve the ultimate quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of specific incoherent sources. For the fully general case, our analysis can still be used to find the best SPADE configurations, generally achieved through a hypotheses-dependent rotation of the SPADE modes. Our results advance the theory of quantum-limited optical discrimination, with possible applications in diagnostics, automated image interpretation, and galaxy identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutron--antineutron oscillations of ultracold neutrons in a storage bottle represented by a one-dimensional potential. The experimental sensitivity is determined by the annihilation rate of antineutrons. Its dependence on the antineutron reflectivity and the relative phase shift between the neutron and the antineutron wavefunctions by a reflection from the wall is derived. Optimization of the antineutron pseudopotential was found crucial to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment. Furthermore, methods are discussed for determining the antineutron pseudopotential, which has only been studied indirectly thus far.</description>

      <title>Saturation of Chaos Bound in a Phenomenological Rotating Black Hole--Effective Matter System at Low-Temperature Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chaotic behavior of a phenomenological system of rotating black holes (BHs) surrounded by radiation, dust, and dark matter as effective matter fluids. We show that the chaos bound is saturated -- but never violated -- when the density parameter $k \rightarrow 1$, which corresponds to a high dark matter concentration in the halo. This saturation is independent of radiation and dust density, occurring in the low-temperature regime where the BH's surface gravity and Hawking temperature decrease. Our results suggest that rotating BHs subjected to a phenomenological representation of a more realistic matter environment can scramble information as efficiently as allowed by physical laws in this limit. This work links quantum chaos research with phenomenological BH-matter configurations, providing a motivation for studies of chaos in astrophysical BHs.</description>

Abstract: Few-atom systems play an important role in understanding the transition from few- to many-body quantum behaviors. This work introduces a new approach for determining the energy spectra and eigenstates of small harmonically trapped single-component Bose and Fermi gases with additive two-body zero-range interactions in one spatial dimension. The interactions for bosons are the usual $\delta$-function interactions while those for fermions are $\delta$-function interactions that contain derivative operators. Details of the derivation and benchmarks of the numerical scheme are presented. Extensions to other systems are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising optoelectronic properties of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their commercial viability is hindered by interfacial energy misalignment, suboptimal light absorption, and thermal instability. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 based PSC through integrated electronic and morphological engineering. Firstly, to address interfacial recombination and inefficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL junction, we introduced a double hole transport layer (HTL) stack comprising CuO and I2O5-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which significantly improved energy level alignment and carrier selectivity. Comprehensive multiphysics simulations, combining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical analysis with finite element method (FEM) based electrical and thermal modeling, demonstrated that optimized doping concentrations and thickness parameters within the CuO/Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers can enhance the PCE to 22.78%. However, planar architectures, while offering ease of fabrication and scalability, exhibit weak near-UV and near-infrared absorption, whereas nanostructures attain superior light trapping but incur significant fabrication complexity, underscoring the need for balanced design strategies. To address these inherent limitations, we propose a hierarchical ellipsoidal patterned solar cell (HEPSC), wherein a top-layer ellipsoidal nanostructure is introduced across the full device stack. This design enhances broadband light trapping and optical confinement throughout the active layers while maintaining fabrication feasibility through geometrically realistic structuring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable route to the deterministic fabrication of impurity ion donors in silicon is required to advance quantum computing architectures based upon such systems. This paper reports the ability to dope isotopically-defined unique (${}^{121}\mathrm{Sb}{}^{123}\mathrm{Sb}$) clusters into silicon with measured detection efficiencies of 94% being obtained. Atomically resolved imaging of the doped clusters reveals a Sb-to-Sb separation of ~2 nm post-implantation, thus indicating suitability to form coupled qudit systems. The method used is fully compatible with integration into processing that includes pre-enrichment of the silicon host to &lt; 3ppm ${}^{29}\mathrm{Si}$ levels. As such, we present a potential pathway to the creation of scaled qudit arrays within silicon platforms for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience of two-dimensional Floquet topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of noise on two-dimensional periodically driven topological phases, focusing on two examples: the anomalous Floquet-Anderson phase and the disordered Floquet-Chern phase. Both phases show an unexpected robustness against timing noise. The noise-induced decay of initially populated topological edge modes occurs in two stages: At short times, thermalization among edge modes leads to exponential decay. This is followed by slow algebraic decay $\sim n^{-1/2}$ with the number of Floquet cycles $n$. The exponent of $1/2$ is characteristic for one-dimensional diffusion, here occurring along the direction perpendicular to the edge. In contrast, localized modes in the bulk exhibit faster decay, $\sim n^{-1}$, corresponding to two-dimensional diffusion. We demonstrate these behaviors through full-scale numerical simulations and support our conclusions using analytical results based upon a phenomenological model. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional Floquet topological phases are ideal candidates for potential applications of Floquet topology, given the unavoidable presence of both quenched disorder and decoherence in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study thermal transport along the edge of a small chiral-spin-liquid device coupled to two Ising-chain reservoirs, a platform suitable for quantum-engineered systems. Adiabatically switching on the tunnel couplings to the reservoirs generates a thermal current that dynamically builds up and reaches a quasi-steady-state regime. In this time window, the two-terminal thermal conductance can approach half-quantized values -- a hallmark of Majorana-mediated transport -- under finely tuned conditions. The results agree with a steady-state Landauer-B\"uttiker description for sufficiently large reservoirs, where energy-resolved transmission rates help identify the optimal parameters to achieve the half-quantized conductance. This work provides a controllable platform to investigate topological thermal transport in engineered spin systems, such as realized in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom settings.</description>

      <title>Topology meets superconductivity in a one-dimensional $t-J$ model of magnetic atoms</title>

Abstract: Strongly interacting fermions represent the key constituent of several intriguing phases of matter. However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy, Monte Carlo event generators, and soft gluons DIScovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study entropy production in Deep Inelastic Scattering using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the dominant contribution to entropy is due to soft gluons. This contribution is usually neglected in standard Monte Carlo approaches, since it does not affect hadronic spectra. However, it is relevant for entropy and multiplicity distributions, as we demonstrate with explicit calculations. We further show that, as one lowers the cutoff - i.e. includes soft gluons - thereby making the Monte Carlo parton distributions closer to inclusive PDFs, the resulting entropy is very close to that measured by the H1 collaboration, without the need to account for hadronization effects. This provides further evidence that the bulk of the measured entropy originates from initial-state effects.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and dynamical phases of self organization of a Bose--Einstein condensate in a transversely pumped red-detuned cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a transversely pumped atomic Bose--Einstein Condensate coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, where effective atom--atom interactions are mediated by pump and cavity photons. A number of experiments and theoretical works have shown the formation of a superradiant state in this setup, where interference of pump and cavity light leads to an optical lattice in which atoms self-consistently organize. This self-organization has been extensively studied using the approximate Dicke model (truncating to two momentum states), as well as through numerical Gross--Pitaevskii simulations in one and two dimensions. Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field.</description>

      <title>Control of single spin-flips in a Rydberg atomic fractal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms trapped by optical tweezers have emerged as a versatile platform to emulate lattices with different geometries, in which long-range interacting spins lead to fascinating phenomena, ranging from spin liquids to topological states of matter. Here, we show that when the lattice has a fractal geometry with Hausdorff dimension 1.58, additional surprises appear. The system is described by a transverse-field Ising model with long-range van der Waals interactions in a Sierpi\`nski gasket fractal. We investigate the problem theoretically using exact diagonalization, variational mean field, quantum Monte Carlo, and a graph-based numerical technique, SIM-GRAPH, which we developed. We find that in the quantum regime, the phase diagram exhibits phases in which the spins flip one-by-one. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experiments performed with single 88Sr atoms trapped by optical tweezers arranged in a fractal geometry. The magnetization and von Neumann entanglement entropy reveal several regimes in which single spin-flips are delocalized over many sites of one sublattice, thus allowing for an unprecedented control of a cascade of phase transitions in a manybody system. These results expand the possibilities of Rydberg atoms for quantum information processing and may have profound implications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Linear Gaussian Quantum State Smoothing: Understanding the optimal unravelings for Alice to estimate Bob's state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.13348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state smoothing is a technique to construct an estimate of the quantum state at a particular time, conditioned on a measurement record from both before and after that time. The technique assumes that an observer, Alice, monitors part of the environment of a quantum system and that the remaining part of the environment, unobserved by Alice, is measured by a secondary observer, Bob, who may have a choice in how he monitors it. The effect of Bob's measurement choice on the effectiveness of Alice's smoothing has been studied in a number of recent papers. Here we expand upon the Letter which introduced linear Gaussian quantum (LGQ) state smoothing [Phys. Rev. Lett., 122, 190402 (2019)]. In the current paper we provide a more detailed derivation of the LGQ smoothing equations and address an open question about Bob's optimal measurement strategy. Specifically, we develop a simple hypothesis that allows one to approximate the optimal measurement choice for Bob given Alice's measurement choice. By 'optimal choice' we mean the choice for Bob that will maximize the purity improvement of Alice's smoothed state compared to her filtered state (an estimated state based only on Alice's past measurement record). The hypothesis, that Bob should choose his measurement so that he observes the back-action on the system from Alice's measurement, seems contrary to one's intuition about quantum state smoothing. Nevertheless we show that it works even beyond a linear Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>Clifford Strategies in Interactive Protocols are Classically Simulatable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\text{MIP}^\ast$ is the class of languages decidable by an efficient classical verifier interacting with multiple quantum provers that share entangled qubits but cannot communicate. Notably, $\text{MIP}^\ast$ was proved to equal $\text{RE}$, the class of all recursively enumerable languages.
  We introduce the complexity class $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$, which restricts quantum provers to Clifford operations and classical post-processing of measurement results, while still allowing shared entangled qubits in any quantum state. We show that any strategy in this model can be simulated by classical provers with shared random bits, and therefore admits a local hidden-variable description. Consequently, $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast = \text{MIP}$, a vastly smaller complexity class compared to $\text{RE}$.
  Moreover, we resolve an open question posed by Kalai et al. (STOC 2023), by showing that quantum advantage in any single-round non-local game requires at least two provers operating outside the $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$ computational model. This rules out a proposed approach for significantly improving the efficiency of quantum advantage tests that are based on compiling non-local games into single-prover interactive protocols.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present BAE, a problem-tailored and noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for quantum amplitude estimation. In a fault tolerant scenario, BAE is capable of saturating the Heisenberg limit; if device noise is present, BAE can dynamically characterize it and self-adapt. We further propose aBAE, an annealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.</description>

      <title>Periodic revivals from supersymmetry in a fermionic kinetically constrained model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of dynamically constrained lattice fermion models. We here illustrate how supersymmetry can be used to construct a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model, inheriting its integrability. The supersymmetric algebra additionally implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic effective model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model. While we focus on a concrete model, our proposed approach is applicable to more general supersymmetric algebras, where it is expected to lead to non-ergodic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Nonreversible Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study constructs Markov chain reversibilizations and develops quantum algorithmic techniques to accelerate nonreversible processes. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and predictive method for atom detection in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method, rooted in estimation theory, to detect individual atoms in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays, such as optical lattices or optical tweezers arrays. Using labelled test images, we demonstrate drastic improvement of the detection accuracy compared to the popular method based on Wiener deconvolution when the inter-site distance is comparable to the radius of the point spread function. The runtime of our method scales approximately linearly with the number of sites, and remains well below 100 ms for an array of 100 x 100 sites on a desktop computer. It is therefore fully compatible with a real-time usage. Finally, we propose a rigorous definition for the signal-to-noise ratio of the problem, and show that it can be used as a predictor for the detection error rate. Our work opens the prospect for future experiments with increased array sizes, or reduced inter-site distances.</description>

      <title>Bounding the computational power of bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum systems operate in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, unlike discrete-variable quantum systems. This distinct mathematical structure leads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an exponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring algorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this structural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical computational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take a step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic quantum computations can be simulated in polynomial space (and exponential time) on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper bound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we improve the best upper bound on $\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $ \textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to $\textsf{PSPACE}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on finite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we propose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments supporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of bosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss why it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in practical implementations.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</description>

      <title>Quantum singular value transformation without block encodings: Near-optimal complexity with minimal ancilla</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework that encapsulates most known quantum algorithms and serves as the foundation for new ones. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring an intrinsic $O(\log L)$ ancilla overhead and circuit depth $\widetilde{O}(L d\lambda )$ for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{k=1}^L H_k$, where $d$ is the polynomial degree and $\lambda=\sum_{k}\|H_k\|$.
  We introduce a simple yet powerful approach that utilizes only basic Hamiltonian simulation techniques, namely, Trotter methods, to: (i) eliminate the need for block encoding, (ii) reduce the ancilla overhead to only a single qubit, and (iii) still maintain near-optimal complexity. Our method achieves a circuit depth of $\widetilde{O}(L(d\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}})^{1+o(1)})$, without requiring any complicated multi-qubit controlled gates. Moreover, $\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}}$ depends on the nested commutators of the terms of $H$ and can be substantially smaller than $\lambda$ for many physically relevant Hamiltonians, a feature absent in standard QSVT. To achieve these results, we make use of Richardson extrapolation in a novel way, systematically eliminating errors in any interleaved sequence of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, thereby establishing a general framework that encompasses QSVT but is more broadly applicable.
  As applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for solving linear systems and estimating ground state properties of Hamiltonians, both achieving near-optimal complexity without relying on oracular access. Overall, our results establish a new framework for quantum algorithms, significantly reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Lattice gas algorithms (LGA) are a class of algorithms including, in chronological order, binary lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), integer lattice gas algorithms (ILGA) and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). They are largely used for simulating non-linear systems. Starting from 1-dimensional ILGA, we design an algorithm where we carry out a fraction of the possible collisions. These fractions are then adapted to reproduce LBM equilibrium distributions, resulting in an adaptive lattice gas algorithm (ALGA) that achieves the same simulation results of LBM. Considering this, we develop a quantum algorithm that involves a linear collision operator and capable of simulating the same phenomena, while still using a measurement and reinitialization procedure. Multi-time-step implementation is possible in some specific cases briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Erasure Minesweeper: exploring hybrid-erasure surface code architectures for efficient quantum error correction</title>

Abstract: Dual-rail erasure qubits can substantially improve the efficiency of quantum error correction, allowing lower error rates to be achieved with fewer qubits, but each erasure qubit requires $3\times$ more transmons to implement compared to standard qubits. In this work, we introduce a hybrid-erasure architecture for surface code error correction where a carefully chosen subset of qubits is designated as erasure qubits while the rest remain standard. Through code-capacity analysis and circuit-level simulations, we show that a hybrid-erasure architecture can boost the performance of the surface code -- much like how a game of Minesweeper becomes easier once a few squares are revealed -- while using fewer resources than a full-erasure architecture. We study strategies for the allocation and placement of erasure qubits through analysis and simulations. We then use the hybrid-erasure architecture to explore the trade-offs between per-qubit cost and key logical performance metrics such as threshold and effective distance in surface code error correction. Our results show that the strategic introduction of dual-rail erasure qubits in a transmon architecture can enhance the logical performance of surface codes for a fixed transmon budget, particularly for near-term-relevant transmon counts and logical error rates.</description>

      <title>Sequential transmission at short times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to transmit and preserve information at short time scales over an n-fold composition of quantum channels $(\Xi^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ modelled as a discrete quantum Markov semigroup, long enough to generate entanglement at some finite $n$. This is achieved by interspersing the action of noise with quantum error correction in succession. We show this by means of a non-trivial lower bound on the one-shot quantum capacity in the sequential setting as a function of $n$, in an attempt to model a linear quantum network and assess its capabilities to distribute entanglement. Intriguingly, the rate of transmission of such a network turns out to be a property of the spectrum of the channels composed in sequence, and the maximum possible error in transmission can be bounded as a function of the noise model only. As an application, we derive an exact error bound for the infinite dimensional pure-loss channel believed to be the dominant source of noise in networks precluding the distribution of entanglement. We exemplify our results by analysing the amplitude damping channel and its bosonic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Drift-resilient mid-circuit measurement and state preparation error mitigation for dynamic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) for dynamic circuits, i.e., those incorporating mid-circuit measurements and feedforward, is important for two key reasons. First, quantum error correction (QEC) circuits are instances of dynamic circuits, and therefore a dynamic circuit-compatible QEM can extend circuit depth and address errors that QEC struggles with. Second, recent studies show that dynamic circuits can significantly outperform purely unitary ones. However, mid-circuit measurement errors remain a major bottleneck. Current solutions rely on readout noise characterization that is vulnerable to temporal noise drifts. To the best of our knowledge, no readout mitigation schemes are resilient to temporal noise drifts. By introducing parity-based noise amplification in repeated measurements, we derive and experimentally demonstrate a drift-resilient protocol for addressing preparation, mid-circuit, and terminating measurement errors without requiring calibration or characterization. Drift resilience increases the longest possible execution time (in terms of shots) and enables flexibility by combining data from non-consecutive times. For platforms such as trapped ions, where the measurements are highly disruptive, we provide an alternative reset-based mitigation scheme. We demonstrate our methods experimentally on IBMQ and Quantinuum hardware. Combined with the Layered-KIK gate error mitigation protocol, the presented readout mitigation approach enables "End-to-end" mitigation for dynamic circuits, that can improve the outcomes of QEC experiments, and that covers the widest range of errors to the best of our knowledge. Other applications of the presented methods include a faster alternative to gate-set tomography and diagnostics of defective qubits during the execution of the target algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle in the real line I compile and contrast, starting with a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, following from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. It was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Can boundary configuration be tuned to optimize directional quantum steering harvesting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the harvesting of quantum steering and its asymmetry between two static detectors locally interacting with a vacuum massless scalar field near an infinite, perfectly reflecting boundary. The detectors are arranged either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with detector $B$ assumed to have an energy gap greater than or equal to that of detector $A$. It is interesting to observe that, with increasing distance between the detectors and the boundary, the boundary tends to suppress quantum steering in one direction while enhancing it in the opposite direction. In the case of identical detectors, steering is symmetric when they are aligned parallel to the boundary. However, orthogonal alignment breaks this symmetry due to their unequal spatial proximity to the boundary. For non-identical detectors in the parallel configuration, the steering from $A$ to $B$ ($A \rightarrow B$) generally surpasses that from $B$ to $A$ ($B \rightarrow A$). In contrast, when the detectors are oriented orthogonally to the boundary, the relative strength of $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow A$ steerability depends on the interplay between the boundary effects and the detectors' energy gap difference. Across most of the parameter space, the orthogonal alignment tends to enhance $B \rightarrow A$ steering while suppressing $A \rightarrow B$ steering compared to the parallel setup. These findings suggest that boundary configurations should be flexibly adjusted according to the directional dependence of steering harvesting in order to optimize quantum information extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occurring in the system.</description>

      <title>Testing Distinguishability and Determinism in Newly Created Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test distinguishability and determinism in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if newly created atoms are distinguishable from each other due to small differences in the nuclear magnetic moment. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for newly created stable isotopes and compare them to the same isotopes found in nature. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. We also propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is considered, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</description>

      <title>Gain on ground state of quantum system for truly $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum system, the conventional non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is $H = \Omega\sigma_x -i\gamma|1\rangle\langle1| + i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$, where $\Omega$ and $\gamma$ are real parameters and $\sigma_x$ denotes Pauli X operator. These three terms represent coherent coupling, loss (on state $|1\rangle$), and gain (on state $|0\rangle$), respectively. Although the works in [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{101}, 230404 (2008); Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{119}, 190401 (2017); Science \textbf{364}, 878 (2019)] proposed theoretically and/or demonstrate dilation methods for a truly parity-time($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric Hamiltonian by embedding into larger Hermitian space, directly realizing the gain term $+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$ has still remained an outstanding challenge for quantum system. While systems omitting this gain term can exhibit a passively $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric energy spectrum (featuring a parallel imaginary shift) and display related phenomena, they fail to capture the full physical behavior and unique properties inherent to truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems. In this manuscript, we propose a method to achieve effective gain on the ground state $|0\rangle$ ($+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$) after averaging all trajectories, by integrating the S{\o}rensen-Reiter effective operator method with the Wiseman-Milburn master equation for continuous measurement and instantaneous feedback control after averaging the evolution over all trajectories. This approach provides a possible pathway to efficiently construct truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum devices, offering a powerful platform for engineering quantum resources vital for quantum information technology applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins by formulating centrality detection as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the QUBO formulations are solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing. Applied to a diverse set of proteins, RinQ consistently identifies central residues that closely align with classical benchmarks, demonstrating both the accuracy and robustness of the approach.</description>

      <title>The simplest Kochen-Specker set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kochen-Specker (KS) sets are fundamental in physics. Every time nature produces bipartite correlations attaining the nonsignaling limit, or two parties always win a nonlocal game impossible to always win classically, is because the parties are measuring a KS set. The simplest quantum system in which all these phenomena occur is a pair of three-level systems. However, the simplest KS sets in dimension three known are asymmetrical and require a large number of bases (the current minimum is 16, set by Peres and Penrose). Here we present a KS set that is much more symmetrical and easier to prove than any previous example. It sets a new record for minimum number of bases, 14, and enables us to refute Conjecture 2 in Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 010201 (2025), setting a new record for qutrit-qutrit perfect strategies with a minimum number of inputs: 5-9. We establish the fundamental nature of this set in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Application of resource theory based on free Clifford+kT computation to early fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware are bringing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) closer to reality. In the early stage of FTQC, however, the numbers of available logical qubits and high-fidelity $T$ gates remain limited, making it crucial to optimize the quantum resource usage. In this work, we aim to study the simulation cost of general quantum states under the constraint that only $k$ $T$ gates can be used, alongside an unlimited number of Clifford gates. Inspired by the notion of robustness of magic (RoM) which quantifies the cost of quantum-circuit simulation using stabilizer states ($k = 0$), we introduce its generalization, which we call Clifford+$kT$ robustness, treating Clifford+$kT$ states as free resources. We explore theoretical properties of Clifford+$kT$ robustness and in particular derive a lower bound that reveals the (in)efficiency of quantum-circuit simulation using Clifford+$kT$ states. Through numerical computations, we also evaluate Clifford+$kT$ robustness for key resource states for universal quantum computation, such as tensor products of the magic states. Our results allow to assess the sampling-cost reduction achieved by the use of Clifford+$kT$ states instead of stabilizer states, providing practical guidance for efficient resource usage in the early-FTQC era.</description>

      <title>Optical Integration With Heralded Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-based Quantum Computation(MBQC) utilize entanglement as resource for performing quantum computation. Generating cluster state using entanglement as resource is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster state with charge-qubit arrrays, we provide analytical derivations and numerical validations for 4-qubit cluster state. We compare our fidelities under ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and due to effect of decoherence. We show incorporating energy relaxation ($T_1$) yields $&gt;$90\% fidelity while pure dephasing $T_2$ show $70\%$ decays at fourth harmonics. We further show under noise $T_2$ decays to 50\% within 15 time units, versus $&gt;$70\% under relaxation time units ($T_1$)--only. This decay quantify degradation effect of $T_2$ on preparing cluster--state preparation is more than $T_1$. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation strategies in near-term MBQC implementations.</description>

      <title>Breaking the system-frequency limitation of quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the system performance has been the primary mission in the domain of quantum key distributions in recent years. Higher performance necessitates a higher repetition frequency, which is, however, strictly limited by the bandwidth. Excessive increase in the repetition frequency is not justifiable since it leads to misaligned and correlated modulation, resulting in compromised security and significant errors. Meanwhile, replacing devices with higher bandwidth means more technique challenges and more expense, which is detrimental to practical implementations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive countermeasure to overcome the bandwidth limitation. We present a new protocol addressing the aforementioned loopholes to ensure security and achieve superior performance compared to previous approaches. Additionally, we address the challenges associated with characterizing and mitigating the correlations by developing two techniques. An experiment setup is completed in this work, whose result indicates that our technique achieves the lowest correlated deviation in all similar works and our proposal breaks the bandwidth-limited secret key rate, thus releasing people from the trade-off between performance and cost, paving the way for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider dissipation operators used in Quantum Optics for the description of quantum spontaneous emission in the context of damped driven Jaynes-Cummings equations. The equations describe quantised one-mode Maxwell field coupled to a two-level molecule. Our main result is the symmetry and nonpositivity of basic dissipation operator of Quantum Optics.</description>

      <title>CNOT Oriented Synthesis for Small-Scale Boolean Functions Using Spatial Structures of Parallelotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has garnered significant interest for its potential to achieve exponential speedups over classical approaches. However, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum circuit scalability remains limited by gate fidelity and qubit counts, restricting physical implementations to small-scale circuits. While prior work has explored logic network structures for quantum circuit synthesis, these methods often neglect the spatial structure intrinsic to Boolean functions. In this paper, we leverage this spatial structure, encoded by parallelotopes embedded in the hypercube defined by the Boolean function, to access a broader optimization space, enhancing synthesis efficiency and reducing circuit complexity. We propose the Spatial Structure-based Hypercube Reduction~(SSHR), a novel synthesis method tailored for small-scale Boolean functions ($\leq 8$). SSHR extracts global spatial features to minimize the use of Multi-Control Toffoli (MCT) gates. To further exploit spatial correlations, we introduce two variants: SSHR-H employs heuristic functions to accelerate synthesis runtime, while SSHR-I integrates an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver to maximize spatial structure utilization. Our approach outperforms existing techniques in small-scale circuit synthesis, achieving 56\% and 81\% reductions in CNOT gate counts compared to the Exclusive Sum-of-Products (ESOP) and Xor-And-Inverter Graph (XAG) methods, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear optics (LO) prohibits certain transformations. In this paper, we study the conditions for a computation to be possible in LO. We find that there are finitely many polynomials such that each of these polynomials evaluates to the same value on two photonic states if and only if there is a LO circuit transforming one of these states into the other. The proof is non-constructive, so we then focus on methods to find such polynomials.</description>

      <title>Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency microwave photodetection by cavity coupled double dots with single cavity-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Encoding and Variational Algorithms: A Framework for Hybrid Quantum Classical Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum computers has been the stimulus that enables the realization of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), an area that integrates the calculational framework of quantum mechanics with the adaptive properties of classical machine learning. This article suggests a broad architecture that allows the connection between classical data pipelines and quantum algorithms, hybrid quantum-classical models emerge as a promising route to scalable and near-term quantum benefit. At the core of this paradigm lies the Classical-Quantum (CQ) paradigm, in which the qubit states of high-dimensional classical data are encoded using sophisticated classical encoding strategies which encode the data in terms of amplitude and angle of rotation, along with superposition mapping. These techniques allow compression of information exponentially into Hilbert space representations, which, together with reduced sample complexity, allows greater feature expressivity. We also examine variational quantum circuits, quantum gates expressed as trainable variables that run with classical optimizers to overcome decoherence, noise, and gate-depth constraints of the existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Experimental comparisons with a Quantum Naive Bayes classifier prove that even small quantum circuits can approximate probabilistic inference with competitive accuracy compared to classical benchmarks, and have much better robustness to noisy data distributionsThis model does not only explain the algorithmic and architectural design of QML, it also offers a roadmap to the implementation of quantum kernels, variational algorithms, and hybrid feedback loops into practice, including optimization, computer vision, and medical diagnostics. The results support the idea that hybrid architectures with strong data encoding and adaptive error protection are key to moving QML out of theory to practice.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Explaining Anomalies with Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks, a class of variational quantum many-body wave functions have attracted considerable research interest across many disciplines, including classical machine learning. Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional line-gapped non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems with real line gaps through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band-inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. The framework is also generalized to imaginary line-gapped topological phases. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>On Quantum BSDE Solver for High-Dimensional Parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum machine learning framework for approximating solutions to high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that can be reformulated as backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In contrast to popular quantum-classical network hybrid approaches, this study employs the pure Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) as the core solver without trainable classical neural networks. The quantum BSDE solver performs pathwise approximation via temporal discretization and Monte Carlo simulation, framed as model-based reinforcement learning. We benchmark VQCbased and classical deep neural network (DNN) solvers on two canonical PDEs as representatives: the Black-Scholes and nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The VQC achieves lower variance and improved accuracy in most cases, particularly in highly nonlinear regimes and for out-of-themoney options, demonstrating greater robustness than DNNs. These results, obtained via quantum circuit simulation, highlight the potential of VQCs as scalable and stable solvers for highdimensional stochastic control problems.</description>
