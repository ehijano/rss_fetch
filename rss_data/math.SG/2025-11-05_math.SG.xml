      <title>A homological criterion for the almost-existence of Hamiltonian chords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a criterion on wrapped Floer homology of an exact Lagrangian sub- manifold in a Liouville domain, which ensures the almost-existence of Hamiltonian chords near a given energy level. To this purpose we introduce a relative version of the coisotropic Hofer-Zehnder capacity, and compare it with some other capacities that are defined using filtered wrapped Floer homology. Our main application is the almost- existence of Hamiltonian chords near any hypersurface if the wrapped Floer homology vanishes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental structure of string geometry theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of a non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this theory, the ``classical'' action is almost uniquely determined by T-symmetry, which is a generalization of the T-duality, where the parameter of ``quantum'' corrections $\beta$ in the path-integral of the theory is independent of that of quantum corrections $\hbar$ in the perturbative string theories. We distinguish the effects of $\beta$ and $\hbar$ by putting " " like "classical" and "loops" for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\beta$, respectively, whereas by putting nothing like classical and loops for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\hbar$, respectively. A non-renormalization theorem states that there is no ``loop'' correction. Thus, there is no problem of non-renormalizability, although the theory is defined by the path-integral over the fields including a metric on string geometry. No ``loop'' correction is also the reason why the complete path-integrals of the all-order perturbative strings in general string backgrounds are derived from the ``tree''-level two-point correlation functions in the perturbative vacua, although string geometry includes information of genera of the world-sheets of the stings. Furthermore, a non-perturbative correction in string coupling with the order $e^{-1/g_s^2}$ is given by a transition amplitude representing a tunneling process between the semi-stable vacua in the ``classical'' potential by an ``instanton'' in the theory. From this effect, a generic initial state will reach the minimum of the potential.</description>

      <title>Proper kernels in microlocal sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be real analytic manifolds and let $\Lambda \subseteq T^*X$ and $\Sigma \subseteq T^*Y$ be closed conic subanalytic singular isotropics. Given a sheaf $K \in \mathrm{Sh}_{-\Lambda \times \Sigma}(X \times Y)$ microsupported in $-\Lambda \times \Sigma$, consider the convolution functor $(-) \ast K \colon \mathrm{Sh}_{\Lambda}(X) \rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}_{\Sigma}(Y)$ from sheaves microsupported in $\Lambda$ to sheaves microsupported in $\Sigma$. We show that the convolution functor $(-) \ast K$ preserves compact objects if and only if for each $x \in X$, the restriction $K|_{\{x\} \times Y} \in \mathrm{Sh}_\Sigma(Y)$ is a compact object. By a result of Kuo-Li, the functor sending a sheaf kernel $K$ to the convolution functor $(-) \ast K$ is an equivalence between the category $\mathrm{Sh}_{-\Lambda \times \Sigma}(X \times Y)$ of sheaves microsupported in $-\Lambda \times \Sigma$ and the category of cocontinuous functors from $\mathrm{Sh}_\Lambda(X)$ to $\mathrm{Sh}_\Sigma(Y)$. We therefore classify all cocontinuous functors that preserve compact objects between the two categories. Our approach is entirely categorical and requires minimal input from geometry: we introduce the notion of a proper object in a compactly generated stable infinity-category and study its properties under strongly continuous localizations to obtain the result. The main geometric input is the analysis of compact and proper objects of the category of $P$-constructible sheaves for a triangulation $P$ of a manifold $Z$ via the exit path category $\mathrm{Exit}(Z, P) \simeq P$. Along the way, we show that a sheaf $F \in \mathrm{Sh}_\Lambda(X)$ is proper if and only if it has perfect stalks, which is equivalent to a result of Nadler.</description>

      <title>Reduced symplectic homology and string topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a common domain of definition for the loop product and the loop coproduct, reduced loop homology, on which they combine to a unital infinitesimal anti-symmetric bialgebra structure. In particular, a relation conjectured by Sullivan holds with an extra term. The structure depends on choices governed by secondary continuation maps. These results on string topology are proved in the more general context of reduced symplectic homology for a suitable class of Weinstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Cohomological localization for Hamiltonian $S^1$-actions and symmetries of complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To begin the paper we revisit a cohomological localization result of Jones-Rawnsley which was subsequently improved by Farber, further generalizing the result. We then proceed to improve a previous result of the author on complete intersections of dimension $8k$ with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action in two directions. Firstly, in dimension $8$ we remove the assumption on the fixed point set. Secondly, in any dimension we prove the result under an analogous assumption on the fixed point set. We also give some applications towards the unimodality of Betti numbers of symplectic manifolds having a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action, and discuss the relation to symplectic rationality problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Curve for strip geometries, Topological Recursion and open GW/DT invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open topological string partition function gives rise to open Gromov-Witten invariants, open Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 3D-5D BPS indices. Utilizing the remodelling conjecture which connects topological recursion and topological string theory, in this paper we study open topological string theory for the subclass of toric Calabi-Yau threefold known as strip geometries. For this purpose, certain new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through this we derive the open topological string partition function and also the associated quantum curve. We also explain how this is related to the open Donaldson-Thomas partition function associated with certain symmetric quivers, exponential networks and $q$-Barnes type integrals. In the process, we also connect how 3D-5D wall crossing affects these partition functions as one varies $x$, in examples.</description>
