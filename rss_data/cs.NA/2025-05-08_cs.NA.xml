      <title>Numerical stabilization for a mixture system with kind damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a numerical analysis of the strong stabilization and polynomial decay of solutions for the initial boundary value problem associated with a system that models the dynamics of a mixture of two rigid solids with porosity. This mathematical model accounts for the complex interactions between the rigid components and their porous structure, providing valuable information on the mechanical behavior of such systems. Our primary objective is to establish conditions under which stabilization is ensured and to rigorously quantify the rate of decay of the solutions. Using numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of different stabilization mechanisms and analyze the influence of key system parameters on the overall dynamics.</description>

      <title>A mixed finite element method for a class of fourth-order stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete, semi-implicit mixed finite element method for approximating solutions to a class of fourth-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz and non-monotone nonlinearities, perturbed by spatially smooth multiplicative Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme is applicable to a range of physically relevant nonlinear models, including the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (sLLBar) equation, the stochastic convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with mass source, and the stochastic regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, among others. To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated problem converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated system, and we establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis for subdiffusion problem with non-positive memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the subdiffusion problem with non-positive memory, which not only arises from physical laws with memory, but could be transformed from sophisticated models such as subdiffusion or subdiffusive Fokker-Planck equation with variable exponent. We apply the non-uniform L1 formula and interpolation quadrature to discretize the fractional derivative and the memory term, respectively, and then adopt the complementary discrete convolution kernel approach to prove the stability and first-order temporal accuracy of the scheme. The main difficulty in numerical analysis lies in the non-positivity of the kernel and its coupling with the complementary discrete convolution kernel (such that different model exponents are also coupled), and the results extend those in [Chen, Thom\'ee and Wahlbin, Math. Comp. 1992] to the subdiffusive case. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Enhanced convergence rates of Adaptive Importance Sampling with recycling schemes via quasi-Monte Carlo methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the integration of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods using the Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling (AMIS). Traditional Importance Sampling (IS) often suffers from poor performance since it heavily relies on the choice of the proposal distributions. The AMIS and the Modified version of AMIS (MAMIS) address this by iteratively refining proposal distributions and reusing all past samples through a recycling strategy. We introduce the RQMC methods into the MAMIS, achieving higher convergence rates compared to the Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Our main contributions include a detailed convergence analysis of the MAMIS estimator under randomized QMC (RQMC) sampling. Specifically, we establish the $L^q$ $(q \geq 2)$ error bound for the RQMC-based estimator using a smoothed projection method, which enables us to apply the H\"older's inequality in the error analysis of the RQMC-based MAMIS estimator. As a result, we prove that the root mean square error of the RQMC-based MAMIS estimator converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\bar{N}_T^{-1+\epsilon})$, where $\bar{N}_T$ is the average number of samples used in each step over $T$ iterations, and $\epsilon &gt; 0$ is arbitrarily small. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, including mixtures of Gaussians, a banana-shaped model, and Bayesian Logistic regression.</description>

      <title>Multigrid methods for the ghost finite element approximation of elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multigrid methods for solving elliptic partial differential equations on arbitrary domains using the nodal ghost finite element method, an unfitted boundary approach where the domain is implicitly defined by a level-set function. This method achieves second-order accuracy and offers substantial computational advantages over both direct solvers and finite-difference-based multigrid methods. A key strength of the ghost finite element framework is its variational formulation, which naturally enables consistent transfer operators and avoids residual splitting across grid levels. We provide a detailed construction of the multigrid components in both one and two spatial dimensions, including smoothers, transfer operators, and coarse grid operators. The choice of the stabilization parameter plays a crucial role in ensuring well-posedness and optimal convergence of the multigrid method. We derive explicit algebraic expressions for this parameter based on the geometry of cut cells. In the two-dimensional setting, we further improve efficiency by performing additional smoothing exclusively on cut cells, reducing computational cost without compromising convergence. Numerical results validate the proposed method across a range of geometries and confirm its robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation due to its inconsistency with relativistic kinetic theory. However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Matrices over a Hilbert space and their low-rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrices are typically considered over fields or rings. Motivated by applications in parametric differential equations and data-driven modeling, we suggest to study matrices with entries from a Hilbert space and present an elementary theory of them: from basic properties to low-rank approximation. Specifically, we extend the idea of cross approximation to such matrices and propose an analogue of the adaptive cross approximation algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that this approach can achieve quasioptimal approximation and be integrated with the existing computational software for partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>On the stability and conditioning of a fictitious domain formulation for fluid-structure interaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distributed Lagrange multiplier formulation for fluid-structure interaction problems in the spirit of the fictitious domain approach. Our previous studies showed that the formulation is unconditionally stable in time and that its mixed finite element discretization is well-posed. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the condition number with respect to mesh refinement. Moreover, we observe that our formulation does not need any stabilization term in presence of small cut cells and conditioning is not affected by the interface position.</description>

      <title>Weighting operators for sparsity regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard regularization methods typically favor solutions which are in, or close to, the orthogonal complement of the null space of the forward operator/matrix $\mathsf{A}$. This particular biasedness might not be desirable in applications and can lead to severe challenges when $\mathsf{A}$ is non-injective.
  We have therefore, in a series of papers, investigated how to "remedy" this fact, relative to a chosen basis and in a certain mathematical sense: Based on a weighting procedure, it turns out that it is possible to modify both Tikhonov and sparsity regularization such that each member of the chosen basis can be almost perfectly recovered from their image under $\mathsf{A}$. In particular, we have studied this problem for the task of using boundary data to identify the source term in an elliptic PDE. However, this weighting procedure involves $\mathsf{A}^\dagger \mathsf{A}$, where $\mathsf{A}^\dagger$ denotes the pseudo inverse of $\mathsf{A}$, and can thus be CPU-demanding and lead to undesirable error amplification.
  We therefore, in this paper, study alternative weighting approaches and prove that some of the recovery results established for the methodology involving $\mathsf{A}$ hold for a broader class of weighting schemes. In fact, it turns out that "any" linear operator $\mathsf{B}$ has an associated proper weighting defined in terms of images under $\mathsf{B}\mathsf{A}$. We also present a series of numerical experiments, employing different choices of $\mathsf{B}$.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional seepage analysis using a polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method (PSBFEM) for three-dimensional seepage analysis. The proposed method combines the semi-analytical capabilities of the SBFEM with the geometric flexibility of polyhedral and octree meshes, making it well-suited for complex seepage problems. Wachspress shape functions are employed to construct shape functions over arbitrary polyhedral elements, enabling accurate approximation along complex boundaries. The method is implemented within the ABAQUS UEL framework to support steady-state, transient, and free-surface seepage simulations. A series of numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and convergence of the proposed method, including benchmark problems and geometrically complex domains. The results demonstrate that the PSBFEM achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to conventional FEM, particularly when using hybrid octree meshes with localized refinement. This framework provides a robust and efficient tool for 3D seepage analysis in geotechnical and hydraulic engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation for quantitative photoacoustic tomography in a diffusive regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the numerical analysis of quantitative photoacoustic tomography. Our goal is to reconstruct the optical coefficients, i.e., the diffusion and absorption coefficients, using multiple internal observational data. The foundation of our numerical algorithm lies in solving an inverse diffusivity problem and a direct problem associated with elliptic equations. The stability of the inverse problem depends critically on a non-zero condition in the internal observations, a condition that can be met using randomly chosen boundary excitation data. Utilizing these randomly generated boundary data, we implement an output least squares formulation combined with finite element discretization to solve the inverse problem. In this scenario, we provide a rigorous error estimate in $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the numerical reconstruction using a weighted energy estimate, inspired by the analysis of a newly proposed conditional stability result. The resulting error estimate serves as a valuable guide for selecting appropriate regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes according to the noise levels present in the data. Several numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of our numerical scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problems related to Perron-Frobenius operators (or transfer operators) have been extensively studied and applied across various fields. In this work, we propose neural network methods for approximating solutions to problems involving these operators. Specifically, we focus on computing the power series of non-expansive Perron-Frobenius operators under a given $L^p$-norm with a constant damping parameter in $(0,1)$. We use PINNs and RVPINNs to approximate solutions in their strong and variational forms, respectively. We provide a priori error estimates for quasi-minimizers of the associated loss functions. We present some numerical results for 1D and 2D examples to show the performance of our methods.</description>

      <title>Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamically inspired invariant subspaces for Koopman and transfer operator approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling for a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectrum of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal, locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</description>

      <title>A Fourier-based inference method for learning interaction kernels in particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the interaction kernel of stochastic interacting particle systems from observations of a single particle. We adopt a semi-parametric approach and represent the interaction kernel in terms of a generalized Fourier series. The basis functions in this expansion are tailored to the problem at hand and are chosen to be orthogonal polynomials with respect to the invariant measure of the mean-field dynamics. The generalized Fourier coefficients are obtained as the solution of an appropriate linear system whose coefficients depend on the moments of the invariant measure, and which are approximated from the particle trajectory that we observe. We quantify the approximation error in the Lebesgue space weighted by the invariant measure and study the asymptotic properties of the estimator in the joint limit as the observation interval and the number of particles tend to infinity, i.e. the joint large time-mean field limit. We also explore the regime where an increasing number of generalized Fourier coefficients is needed to represent the interaction kernel. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Convergence of Symmetrized Graph Laplacian on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral convergence of a symmetrized Graph Laplacian matrix induced by a Gaussian kernel evaluated on pairs of embedded data, sampled from a manifold with boundary, a sub-manifold of $\mathbb{R}^m$. Specifically, we deduce the convergence rates for eigenpairs of the discrete Graph-Laplacian matrix to the eigensolutions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator that are well-defined on manifolds with boundary, including the homogeneous Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the Dirichlet problem, we deduce the convergence of the \emph{truncated Graph Laplacian}, which is recently numerically observed in applications, and provide a detailed numerical investigation on simple manifolds. Our method of proof relies on the min-max argument over a compact and symmetric integral operator, leveraging the RKHS theory for spectral convergence of integral operator and a recent pointwise asymptotic result of a Gaussian kernel integral operator on manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Factorizations and fast diagonalization for the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates diagonalization-based methods for efficiently solving linear evolution problems, with a particular focus on the heat equation. The plain diagonalization of the differential operator, though effective for elliptic problems where fast diagonalization can be used, exhibits instability when applied to the heat equation. To address this difficulty, we examine three alternative approaches, based on LU factorization, a suitable arrowhead factorization, and a low-rank modification. These methods introduce more robust factorizations of the time derivative, ensuring both computational efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence for numerical $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $\alpha$-dissipative solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$, can be computed numerically with order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{{1}/{8}}+\Delta x^{{\beta}/{4}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, provided there exist constants $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$. The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds of the SE and DE formulas for integrals with logarithmic and algebraic singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single exponential (SE) and double exponential (DE) formulas are widely recognized as efficient quadrature formulas for evaluating integrals with endpoint singularity. For integrals exhibiting algebraic singularity, explicit error bounds in a computable form have been provided, enabling computations with guaranteed accuracy. Such explicit error bounds have also been provided for integrals exhibiting logarithmic singularity. However, these error bounds have two points to be discussed. The first point is on overestimation of divergence speed of logarithmic singularity. The second point is on the case where there exist both logarithmic and algebraic singularity. To address these issues, this study provides new error bounds for integrals with logarithmic and algebraic singularity. Although existing and new error bounds described above pertain to integrals over the finite interval, the SE and DE formulas are also applicable to integrals over the semi-infinite interval. On the basis of the new results, this study provides new error bounds for integrals over the semi-infinite interval with logarithmic and algebraic singularity at the origin.</description>

      <title>Algorithms of very high space-time orders of accuracy for hyperbolic equations in the semidiscrete WENO-DeC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a deep investigation of a family of arbitrary high order numerical methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), with particular emphasis on very high order versions, i.e., with order higher than 5. More in detail, within the context of a generic Finite Volume (FV) semidiscretization, we consider Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate the possibility of utilizing very high order schemes in concrete situations and highlight the related advantages. On the other one, we want to debunk the myth according to which, in the context of numerical resolution of hyperbolic PDEs with very high order spatial discretizations, the adoption of lower order time discretizations, e.g., strong stability preserving (SSP) or linearly strong stability preserving ($\ell SSP$) Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, does not affect the overall accuracy of the resulting approach and consequently its computational efficiency. Numerical results are reported for the linear advection equation (LAE) and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, showing the advantages and the critical aspects of the adoption of very high order numerical methods. Overall, the results indicate the potential for their use in real--life applications, offering advantages in terms of efficiency, such as requiring shorter computational times to achieve a prescribed error, even in problems involving discontinuities. Furthermore, the results confirm order degradation and efficiency loss when coupling very high order space discretizations with lower order SSPRK time discretizations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quadrature Rules for Solving PDEs using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the challenges associated with numerical integration when applying Neural Networks to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We specifically investigate the Deep Ritz Method (DRM), chosen for its practical applicability and known sensitivity to integration inaccuracies. Our research demonstrates that both standard deterministic integration techniques and biased stochastic quadrature methods can lead to incorrect solutions. In contrast, employing high-order, unbiased stochastic quadrature rules defined on integration meshes in low dimensions is shown to significantly enhance convergence rates at a comparable computational expense with respect to low-order methods like Monte Carlo. Additionally, we introduce novel stochastic quadrature approaches designed for triangular and tetrahedral mesh elements, offering increased adaptability for handling complex geometric domains. We highlight that the variance inherent in the stochastic gradient acts as a bottleneck for convergence. Furthermore, we observe that for gradient-based optimisation, the crucial factor is the accurate integration of the gradient, rather than just minimizing the quadrature error of the loss function itself.</description>

      <title>Sibuya probability distributions and numerical evaluation of fractional-order operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore the Sibuya discrete probability distribution, which serves as the basis and the main instrument for numerical simulations of Grunwald--Letnikov fractional derivatives by the Monte Carlo method. We provide three methods for simulating the Sibuya distribution. We also introduce the Sibuya-like sieved probability distributions, and apply them to numerical fractional-order differentiation. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo method for evaluating fractional-order integrals, and suggest the notion of the continuous Sibuya probability distribution. The developed methods and tools are illustrated by examples of computation. We provide the MATLAB toolboxes for simulation of the Sibuya probability distribution, and for the numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Unified Perspective on Orthogonalization and Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper makes a formal connection between two families of widely used matrix factorization algorithms in numerical linear algebra. One family consists of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm and its variants for computing the Hermitian eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition. The other consists of Gaussian elimination and the Gram-Schmidt procedure with various pivoting rules for computing the Cholesky decomposition and QR decomposition respectively.
  Both families are cast as special cases of a more general class of factorization algorithms. We provide a randomized pivoting rule that applies to this general class (which differs substantially from the usual pivoting rules for Gaussian elimination / Gram-Schmidt) which results in the same linear rate of convergence for each algorithm, irrespective of which factorization it computes.
  A second important consequence of this randomized pivoting rule is a provable, effective bound on the numerical stability of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm, which addresses a longstanding open problem of Demmel and Veseli\'c `92.</description>
