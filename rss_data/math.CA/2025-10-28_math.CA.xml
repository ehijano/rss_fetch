      <title>Discrete Bound States in a Toy Model for Weak Turbulence and Implications for the Invariant Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model Hamiltonian dynamical system has been derived to study frequency cascades in the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the torus. Here, we explore the framework for exploring a canonical ensemble formulation of the dynamics through classification of energy minimizers for fixed mass and characterizing the invariant measure in a neighborhood of those minimizers.</description>

      <title>On the Theorem of Gauss--Lucas for quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that the roots of the derivative of a polynomial with quaternionic coefficients belong to the union of the intersections of sets defined in terms of certain projections of a polynomial. The result strengthens the quaternion version of Gauss-Lucas theorem, proved by Ghiloni and Perotti in 2018.</description>

      <title>Weyl group action on Radon hypergeometric function and its symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $r,n,N:=rn$, we consider the Radon hypergeometric function (Radon HGF) associated with a partition $\lambda$ of $n$ defined on the Grassmannian $Gr(m,N)$ for $r&lt;m&lt;N$, which is obtained as the Radon transform of a character of the group $H_{\lambda}\subset G:=GL(N)$. We study its symmetry described by the Weyl group analogue $N_{G}(H_{\lambda})/H_{\lambda}$. We consider the Hermitian matrix integral analogue of the Gauss HGF and its confluent family, which are understood as the Radon HGF on $Gr(2r,4r)$ for partitions $\lambda$ of $4$, we apply the result of symmetry to these particular cases and derive a transformation formula for the Gauss analogue which is known as a part of "24 solutions of Kummer" for the classical Gauss HGF. We derive a similar transformation formula for the analogue Kummer's confluent HGF.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the heat equation implies parabolic uniform rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be an open set in space-time with boundary $\Sigma = \partial \Omega$. Under minimal and natural background assumptions - namely, that $\Sigma$ is time-symmetrically parabolic Ahlfors--David regular and that $\Omega$ satisfies an interior corkscrew condition - we treat a one-phase parabolic free boundary problem which establishes the necessity of parabolic uniform rectifiability for $L^p(d\sigma)$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. More precisely, we prove that if the caloric measure associated with $\Omega$ satisfies a weak-$A_\infty$ condition with respect to the surface measure $\sigma = \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{par}}^{n+1}\!\lfloor_{\Sigma}$, then $\Sigma$ is parabolically uniformly rectifiable, hence equivalently, that solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the heat (or adjoint heat) equation in $\Omega$ with boundary data in $L^p(d\sigma)$, for some $p \in (1,\infty)$, implies parabolic uniform rectifiability. Our main theorem thus identifies parabolic uniform rectifiability as the correct geometric framework for boundary regularity, and $L^p$ solvability, in the parabolic setting.</description>

      <title>Pinned patterns and density theorems in $\mathbb R^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integers $k\geq 3,d\geq 2,$ we consider the abundance property of pinned $k$-point patterns occurring in $E\subseteq \mathbb R^d$ with positive upper density $\delta(E)$. We show that for any fixed $k$-point pattern $V$, there is a set $E$ with positive upper density such that $E$ avoids all sufficiently large affine copies of $V$, with one vertex fixed at any point in $E$. However, we obtain a positive quantitative result, which states that for any fixed $E$ with positive upper density, there exists a $k$-point pattern $V,$ such that for any $x\in E$, the pinned scaling factor set
  \begin{equation*}
  D_x^V(E):=\{r&gt; 0: \exists \text{ isometry } O \text{ such that }x+r\cdot O(V)\subseteq E\},
  \end{equation*}
  has upper density $\geq \tilde \varepsilon&gt;0$, where constant $\tilde \varepsilon$ depends on $k,d$ and $\delta(E)$.</description>

      <title>Compactness Arguments in Real Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07078v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theorems crucial in elementary real function theory have proofs in which compactness arguments are used. Despite the introduction in relatively recent literature of each new highly elegant compactness argument, or of an equivalent, this work is based on the idea that, with the aid of simple notions such as local properties of continuous or of differentiable functions, suprema, nested intervals, convergent subsequences or the simplest form of the Heine-Borel Theorem, the use of one of four simple types of compactness arguments, suffices, and the resulting development of real function theory need not involve notions more sophisticated than what immediately follows from the usual ordering of the real numbers. Thus, four independent approaches are presented, one for each type of compactness argument: supremum arguments, nested interval arguments, Heine-Borel arguments and sequential compactness arguments.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory integral operators and variable Schr\"odinger propagators: beyond the universal estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of H\"ormander-type oscillatory integral operators in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 3$ odd with real analytic phase. We derive weak conditions on the phase which ensure $L^p$ bounds beyond the universal $p \geq 2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{n-1}$ range guaranteed by Stein's oscillatory integral theorem. This expands and elucidates pioneering work of Bourgain from the early 1990s. We also consider a closely related class of variable coefficient Schr\"odinger propagator-type operators, and show that the corresponding theory differs significantly from that of the H\"ormander-type operators. The main ingredient in the proof is a curved Kakeya/Nikodym maximal function estimate. This is established by combining the polynomial method with certain uniform sublevel set estimates for real analytic functions. The sublevel set estimates are the main novelty in the argument and can be interpreted as a form of quantification of linear independence in the $C^{\omega}$ category.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the existence of anisotropic Minkowski content and anisotropic outer Minkowski content. Our result is that the Minkowski content of the topological boundary of a given set of finite perimeter $E$ coincides with the perimeter of $E$ if and only if the anisotropic Minkowski content of the topological boundary of $E$ coincides with half of the sum of the anisotropic perimeter of $E$ and the anisotropic perimeter of the complement of $E.$ As a consequence, we find that the existence of anisotropic outer Minkowski content of a given set of finite perimeter and its complement ensures the existence of outer Minkowski content of the set and its complement.</description>

      <title>On some examples and counterexamples about weighted Lagrange interpolation with Exponential and Hermite weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Bernstein conjecture about optimal node systems in classical polynomial Lagrange interpolation, standing unresolved for about half a century, was solved by T. Kilgore in 1978. Immediately following him, also the additional conjecture of Erd\H{o}s was solved by de Boor and Pinkus. These breakthrough achievements were built on a fundamental auxiliary result on nonsingularity of derivative (Jacobian) matrices of certain interval maxima in function of the nodes. After the above breakthrough, a considerable effort was made to extend the results to the case of at least certain Chebyshev-Haar spaces of functions. Here, we analyse, in what extent the key nonsingularity statement remains true in case of exponentially weighted interpolation on the halfline, or with Hermite weights on the full real line. In these settings counterexamples demonstrate that the respective derivative matrices may as well be singular. It remains to further study if the Bernstein- and Erd\H{o}s characterizations remain valid. The ``hybrid'' Chebyshev-Haar system of exponentially weighted polynomials adjoined with constant functions and the corresponding interpolation were previously studied, as well. Some hints were also given for the proof of the respective Bernstein and Erd\H{o}s conjectures. We present in detail the full proof together with all the auxiliary results needed in this setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for eigenfunctions with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym bounds for eigenfunctions of Blair--Sogge to a larger range of exponents, which is optimal in odd dimensions. On manifolds of constant sectional curvature we introduce a new anisotropic variant of the microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym norm that further enlarges the admissible $p$-range. As a corollary, we obtain improved $L^p$ bounds for Hecke--Maass forms on compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds by combining with a recent result of Hou. Further applications include sharp $L^q\!\to\!L^p$ estimates for H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, improved $L^q\!\to\!L^p$ Fourier extension bounds, and improved bounds for the Bochner--Riesz conjecture in $\mathbb R^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the lower-dimensional anisotropic Minkowski content and $\mathcal{S}$-content. We establish that these anisotropic contents exhibit properties analogous to their isotropic counterparts by proving analogous inequalities between the lower-dimensional anisotropic Minkowski content and $\mathcal{S}$-content $\mathcal{S}$-content. A key component of our approach is demonstrating that the associated anisotropic volume function is of Kneser type, a result that underpins many of our proofs. In addition, we introduce anisotropic versions of the Minkowski and $\mathcal{S}$-dimensions and derive inequalities relating them. As an application, we analyze the existence of the $log_2(3)$-dimensional anisotropic Minkowski and $\mathcal{S}$-contents of the Sierpinski gasket.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. To establish the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct solutions with the zero-mean property. We also prove that such waves may not exist for the well-known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional at the wave, restricted to the space of zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed from the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. Finally, we address the problem of orbital stability as a consequence of the spectral stability.</description>

Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order beam equations with clamped boundary conditions are derived. The results extend atheorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also establishes an a priori estimate for C3-norm of positive solutions, which is optimal in Holder regularity. Applications to MEMS/NEMS models are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power-law dynamical localization for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation. Actually, we introduce new arguments in the study of dynamical localization for long-range models with unbounded potentials, involving the Min-Max Principle and a notion of Power-Law ULE. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on KAM techniques or on Green's function estimates, but rather on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models, such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>

      <title>From small eigenvalues to large cuts, and Chowla's cosine problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every graph with average degree $d$ and smallest adjacency eigenvalue $|\lambda_n|\leq d^{\gamma}$ contains a clique of size $d^{1-O(\gamma)}$. A simple corollary of this yields the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem (1965): for every finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$, the minimum of the cosine polynomial satisfies $$\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -|A|^{1/10-o(1)}.$$
  Another application makes significant progress on the problem of MaxCut in $H$-free graphs initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz in the 1970's. We show that every $m$-edge graph with no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>
