      <title>Intelligent Text-Conditioned Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a multimodal neural network trained on (text, image) pairs to predict the most relevant text caption given an image. It has been used extensively in image generation by connecting its output with a generative model such as VQGAN, with the most notable example being OpenAI's DALLE-2. In this project, we apply a similar approach to bridge the gap between natural language and music. Our model is split into two steps: first, we train a CLIP-like model on pairs of text and music over contrastive loss to align a piece of music with its most probable text caption. Then, we combine the alignment model with a music decoder to generate music. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at text-conditioned deep music generation. Our experiments show that it is possible to train the text-music alignment model using contrastive loss and train a decoder to generate music from text prompts.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Modal Speech In-Painting: A Sequence-to-Sequence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of reconstructing missing parts of speech audio from context is called speech in-painting. Human perception of speech is inherently multi-modal, involving both audio and visual (AV) cues. In this paper, we introduce and study a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) speech in-painting model that incorporates AV features. Our approach extends AV speech in-painting techniques to scenarios where both audio and visual data may be jointly corrupted. To achieve this, we employ a multi-modal training paradigm that boosts the robustness of our model across various conditions involving acoustic and visual distortions. This makes our distortion-aware model a plausible solution for real-world challenging environments. We compare our method with existing transformer-based and recurrent neural network-based models, which attempt to reconstruct missing speech gaps ranging from a few milliseconds to over a second. Our experimental results demonstrate that our novel seq2seq architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer solution by 38.8% in terms of enhancing speech quality and 7.14% in terms of improving speech intelligibility. We exploit a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs lip-reading (transcribing video components to text) while reconstructing missing parts of the associated speech.</description>

      <title>PTA: Enhancing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis through Pipelined Prediction and Translation-based Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to understand opinions in a granular manner, advancing human-computer interaction and other fields. Traditionally, MABSA methods use a joint prediction approach to identify aspects and sentiments simultaneously. However, we argue that joint models are not always superior. Our analysis shows that joint models struggle to align relevant text tokens with image patches, leading to misalignment and ineffective image utilization.
  In contrast, a pipeline framework first identifies aspects through MATE (Multimodal Aspect Term Extraction) and then aligns these aspects with image patches for sentiment classification (MASC: Multimodal Aspect-Oriented Sentiment Classification). This method is better suited for multimodal scenarios where effective image use is crucial. We present three key observations: (a) MATE and MASC have different feature requirements, with MATE focusing on token-level features and MASC on sequence-level features; (b) the aspect identified by MATE is crucial for effective image utilization; and (c) images play a trivial role in previous MABSA methods due to high noise.
  Based on these observations, we propose a pipeline framework that first predicts the aspect and then uses translation-based alignment (TBA) to enhance multimodal semantic consistency for better image utilization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on widely used MABSA datasets Twitter-15 and Twitter-17. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the pipeline approach and its potential to provide valuable insights for future MABSA research.
  For reproducibility, the code and checkpoint will be released.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap3D: Improving 3D Content Creation with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multi-view diffusion models for 3D content creation. However, there remains a significant gap in image quality and prompt-following ability compared to 2D diffusion models. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality 3D assets with detailed captions. To address this challenge, we propose Bootstrap3D, a novel framework that automatically generates an arbitrary quantity of multi-view images to assist in training multi-view diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline that employs (1) 2D and video diffusion models to generate multi-view images based on constructed text prompts, and (2) our fine-tuned 3D-aware MV-LLaVA for filtering high-quality data and rewriting inaccurate captions. Leveraging this pipeline, we have generated 1 million high-quality synthetic multi-view images with dense descriptive captions to address the shortage of high-quality 3D data. Furthermore, we present a Training Timestep Reschedule (TTR) strategy that leverages the denoising process to learn multi-view consistency while maintaining the original 2D diffusion prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Bootstrap3D can generate high-quality multi-view images with superior aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and maintained view consistency.</description>

      <title>Advancing Ear Biometrics: Enhancing Accuracy and Robustness through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biometric identification is a reliable method to verify individuals based on their unique physical or behavioral traits, offering a secure alternative to traditional methods like passwords or PINs. This study focuses on ear biometric identification, exploiting its distinctive features for enhanced accuracy, reliability, and usability. While past studies typically investigate face recognition and fingerprint analysis, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of ear biometrics in overcoming limitations such as variations in facial expressions and lighting conditions. We utilized two datasets: AMI (700 images from 100 individuals) and EarNV1.0 (28,412 images from 164 individuals). To improve the accuracy and robustness of our ear biometric identification system, we applied various techniques including data preprocessing and augmentation. Our models achieved a testing accuracy of 99.35% on the AMI Dataset and 98.1% on the EarNV1.0 dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in precisely identifying individuals based on ear biometric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io .</description>

      <title>BeFA: A General Behavior-driven Feature Adapter for Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimedia recommender systems focus on utilizing behavioral information and content information to model user preferences. Typically, it employs pre-trained feature encoders to extract content features, then fuses them with behavioral features. However, pre-trained feature encoders often extract features from the entire content simultaneously, including excessive preference-irrelevant details. We speculate that it may result in the extracted features not containing sufficient features to accurately reflect user preferences. To verify our hypothesis, we introduce an attribution analysis method for visually and intuitively analyzing the content features. The results indicate that certain products' content features exhibit the issues of information drift}and information omission,reducing the expressive ability of features. Building upon this finding, we propose an effective and efficient general Behavior-driven Feature Adapter (BeFA) to tackle these issues. This adapter reconstructs the content feature with the guidance of behavioral information, enabling content features accurately reflecting user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the adapter across all multimedia recommendation methods. The code will be publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.</description>

      <title>Arabic Handwritten Text for Person Biometric Identification: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study thoroughly investigates how well deep learning models can recognize Arabic handwritten text for person biometric identification. It compares three advanced architectures -- ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB7 -- using three widely recognized datasets: AHAWP, Khatt, and LAMIS-MSHD. Results show that EfficientNetB7 outperforms the others, achieving test accuracies of 98.57\%, 99.15\%, and 99.79\% on AHAWP, Khatt, and LAMIS-MSHD datasets, respectively. EfficientNetB7's exceptional performance is credited to its innovative techniques, including compound scaling, depth-wise separable convolutions, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks. These features allow the model to extract more abstract and distinctive features from handwritten text images. The study's findings hold significant implications for enhancing identity verification and authentication systems, highlighting the potential of deep learning in Arabic handwritten text recognition for person biometric identification.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Frequency Correlation for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep priors have emerged as potent methods in hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction. While most methods emphasize space-domain learning using image space priors like non-local similarity, frequency-domain learning using image frequency priors remains neglected, limiting the reconstruction capability of networks. In this paper, we first propose a Hyperspectral Frequency Correlation (HFC) prior rooted in in-depth statistical frequency analyses of existent HSI datasets. Leveraging the HFC prior, we subsequently establish the frequency domain learning composed of a Spectral-wise self-Attention of Frequency (SAF) and a Spectral-spatial Interaction of Frequency (SIF) targeting low-frequency and high-frequency components, respectively. The outputs of SAF and SIF are adaptively merged by a learnable gating filter, thus achieving a thorough exploitation of image frequency priors. Integrating the frequency domain learning and the existing space domain learning, we finally develop the Correlation-driven Mixing Domains Transformer (CMDT) for HSI reconstruction. Extensive experiments highlight that our method surpasses various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Once-for-All: Controllable Generative Image Compression with Dynamic Granularity Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although recent generative image compression methods have demonstrated impressive potential in optimizing the rate-distortion-perception trade-off, they still face the critical challenge of flexible rate adaption to diverse compression necessities and scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework, Control-GIC, the first capable of fine-grained bitrate adaption across a broad spectrum while ensuring high-fidelity and generality compression. We base Control-GIC on a VQGAN framework representing an image as a sequence of variable-length codes (i.e. VQ-indices), which can be losslessly compressed and exhibits a direct positive correlation with the bitrates. Therefore, drawing inspiration from the classical coding principle, we naturally correlate the information density of local image patches with their granular representations, to achieve dynamic adjustment of the code quantity following different granularity decisions. This implies we can flexibly determine a proper allocation of granularity for the patches to acquire desirable compression rates. We further develop a probabilistic conditional decoder that can trace back to historic encoded multi-granularity representations according to transmitted codes, and then reconstruct hierarchical granular features in the formalization of conditional probability, enabling more informative aggregation to improve reconstruction realism. Our experiments show that Control-GIC allows highly flexible and controllable bitrate adaption and even once compression on an entire dataset to fulfill constrained bitrate conditions. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Point Cloud Compression for Machine Perception: A Simple and Strong Baseline by Learning the Octree Depth Level Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud compression has garnered significant interest in computer vision. However, existing algorithms primarily cater to human vision, while most point cloud data is utilized for machine vision tasks. To address this, we propose a point cloud compression framework that simultaneously handles both human and machine vision tasks. Our framework learns a scalable bit-stream, using only subsets for different machine vision tasks to save bit-rate, while employing the entire bit-stream for human vision tasks. Building on mainstream octree-based frameworks like VoxelContext-Net, OctAttention, and G-PCC, we introduce a new octree depth-level predictor. This predictor adaptively determines the optimal depth level for each octree constructed from a point cloud, controlling the bit-rate for machine vision tasks. For simpler tasks (\textit{e.g.}, classification) or objects/scenarios, we use fewer depth levels with fewer bits, saving bit-rate. Conversely, for more complex tasks (\textit{e.g}., segmentation) or objects/scenarios, we use deeper depth levels with more bits to enhance performance. Experimental results on various datasets (\textit{e.g}., ModelNet10, ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanNet, and KITTI) show that our point cloud compression approach improves performance for machine vision tasks without compromising human vision quality.</description>

      <title>Advancing Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing via Segment-wise Pseudo Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Video Parsing task aims to identify and temporally localize the events that occur in either or both the audio and visual streams of audible videos. It often performs in a weakly-supervised manner, where only video event labels are provided, \ie, the modalities and the timestamps of the labels are unknown. Due to the lack of densely annotated labels, recent work attempts to leverage pseudo labels to enrich the supervision. A commonly used strategy is to generate pseudo labels by categorizing the known video event labels for each modality. However, the labels are still confined to the video level, and the temporal boundaries of events remain unlabeled. In this paper, we propose a new pseudo label generation strategy that can explicitly assign labels to each video segment by utilizing prior knowledge learned from the open world. Specifically, we exploit the large-scale pretrained models, namely CLIP and CLAP, to estimate the events in each video segment and generate segment-level visual and audio pseudo labels, respectively. We then propose a new loss function to exploit these pseudo labels by taking into account their category-richness and segment-richness. A label denoising strategy is also adopted to further improve the visual pseudo labels by flipping them whenever abnormally large forward losses occur. We perform extensive experiments on the LLP dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed design and we achieve state-of-the-art video parsing performance on all types of event parsing, \ie, audio event, visual event, and audio-visual event. We also examine the proposed pseudo label generation strategy on a relevant weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization task and the experimental results again verify the benefits and generalization of our method.</description>

      <title>Generalized Jersey Number Recognition Using Multi-task Learning With Orientation-guided Weight Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jersey number recognition (JNR) has always been an important task in sports analytics. Improving recognition accuracy remains an ongoing challenge because images are subject to blurring, occlusion, deformity, and low resolution. Recent research has addressed these problems using number localization and optical character recognition. Some approaches apply player identification schemes to image sequences, ignoring the impact of human body rotation angles on jersey digit identification. Accurately predicting the number of jersey digits by using a multi-task scheme to recognize each individual digit enables more robust results. Based on the above considerations, this paper proposes a multi-task learning method called the angle-digit refine scheme (ADRS), which combines human body orientation angles and digit number clues to recognize athletic jersey numbers. Based on our experimental results, our approach increases inference information, significantly improving prediction accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, which can only handle a single type of sport, the proposed method produces a more diverse and practical JNR application. The incorporation of diverse types of team sports such as soccer, football, basketball, volleyball, and baseball into our dataset contributes greatly to generalized JNR in sports analytics. Our accuracy achieves 64.07% on Top-1 and 89.97% on Top-2, with corresponding F1 scores of 67.46% and 90.64%, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital sports media necessitates sophisticated information retrieval systems that can efficiently parse extensive multimodal datasets. This paper demonstrates SoccerRAG, an innovative framework designed to harness the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract soccer-related information through natural language queries. By leveraging a multimodal dataset, SoccerRAG supports dynamic querying and automatic data validation, enhancing user interaction and accessibility to sports archives. We present a novel interactive user interface (UI) based on the Chainlit framework which wraps around the core functionality, and enable users to interact with the SoccerRAG framework in a chatbot-like visual manner.</description>

      <title>Sequence-to-Sequence Multi-Modal Speech In-Painting</title>

Abstract: Speech in-painting is the task of regenerating missing audio contents using reliable context information. Despite various recent studies in multi-modal perception of audio in-painting, there is still a need for an effective infusion of visual and auditory information in speech in-painting. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequence-to-sequence model that leverages the visual information to in-paint audio signals via an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder plays the role of a lip-reader for facial recordings and the decoder takes both encoder outputs as well as the distorted audio spectrograms to restore the original speech. Our model outperforms an audio-only speech in-painting model and has comparable results with a recent multi-modal speech in-painter in terms of speech quality and intelligibility metrics for distortions of 300 ms to 1500 ms duration, which proves the effectiveness of the introduced multi-modality in speech in-painting.</description>

      <title>SAM as the Guide: Mastering Pseudo-Label Refinement in Semi-Supervised Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SemiRES, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to perform RES. A significant hurdle in applying semi-supervised techniques to RES is the prevalence of noisy pseudo-labels, particularly at the boundaries of objects. SemiRES incorporates the Segment Anything Model (SAM), renowned for its precise boundary demarcation, to improve the accuracy of these pseudo-labels. Within SemiRES, we offer two alternative matching strategies: IoU-based Optimal Matching (IOM) and Composite Parts Integration (CPI). These strategies are designed to extract the most accurate masks from SAM's output, thus guiding the training of the student model with enhanced precision. In instances where a precise mask cannot be matched from the available candidates, we develop the Pixel-Wise Adjustment (PWA) strategy, guiding the student model's training directly by the pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three RES benchmarks--RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref reveal its superior performance compared to fully supervised methods. Remarkably, with only 1% labeled data, our SemiRES outperforms the supervised baseline by a large margin, e.g. +18.64% gains on RefCOCO val set. The project code is available at \url{https://github.com/nini0919/SemiRES}.</description>

      <title>ITEACH-Net: Inverted Teacher-studEnt seArCH Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There remain two critical challenges that hinder the development of ERC. Firstly, there is a lack of exploration into mining deeper insights from the data itself for conversational emotion tasks. Secondly, the systems exhibit vulnerability to random modality feature missing, which is a common occurrence in realistic settings. Focusing on these two key challenges, we propose a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning in ERC, called "Inverted Teacher-studEnt seArCH Network (ITEACH-Net)." ITEACH-Net comprises two novel components: the Emotion Context Changing Encoder (ECCE) and the Inverted Teacher-Student (ITS) framework. Specifically, leveraging the tendency for emotional states to exhibit local stability within conversational contexts, ECCE captures these patterns and further perceives their evolution over time. Recognizing the varying challenges of handling incomplete versus complete data, ITS employs a teacher-student framework to decouple the respective computations. Subsequently, through Neural Architecture Search, the student model develops enhanced computational capabilities for handling incomplete data compared to the teacher model. During testing, we design a novel evaluation method, testing the model's performance under different missing rate conditions without altering the model weights. We conduct experiments on three benchmark ERC datasets, and the results demonstrate that our ITEACH-Net outperforms existing methods in incomplete multimodal ERC. We believe ITEACH-Net can inspire relevant research on the intrinsic nature of emotions within conversation scenarios and pave a more robust route for incomplete learning techniques. Codes will be made available.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Robustness of Decision-Level Through Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Embodied Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence empowers agents with a profound sense of perception, enabling them to respond in a manner closely aligned with real-world situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) delve into language instructions with depth, serving a crucial role in generating plans for intricate tasks. Thus, LLM-based embodied models further enhance the agent's capacity to comprehend and process information. However, this amalgamation also ushers in new challenges in the pursuit of heightened intelligence. Specifically, attackers can manipulate LLMs to produce irrelevant or even malicious outputs by altering their prompts. Confronted with this challenge, we observe a notable absence of multi-modal datasets essential for comprehensively evaluating the robustness of LLM-based embodied models. Consequently, we construct the Embodied Intelligent Robot Attack Dataset (EIRAD), tailored specifically for robustness evaluation. Additionally, two attack strategies are devised, including untargeted attacks and targeted attacks, to effectively simulate a range of diverse attack scenarios. At the same time, during the attack process, to more accurately ascertain whether our method is successful in attacking the LLM-based embodied model, we devise a new attack success evaluation method utilizing the BLIP2 model. Recognizing the time and cost-intensive nature of the GCG algorithm in attacks, we devise a scheme for prompt suffix initialization based on various target tasks, thus expediting the convergence process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits a superior attack success rate when targeting LLM-based embodied models, indicating a lower level of decision-level robustness in these models.</description>

      <title>Edit As You Wish: Video Caption Editing with Multi-grained User Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically narrating videos in natural language complying with user requests, i.e. Controllable Video Captioning task, can help people manage massive videos with desired intentions. However, existing works suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the control signal is single-grained which can not satisfy diverse user intentions; 2) the video description is generated in a single round which can not be further edited to meet dynamic needs. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{C}aption \textbf{E}diting \textbf{(VCE)} task to automatically revise an existing video description guided by multi-grained user requests. Inspired by human writing-revision habits, we design the user command as a pivotal triplet \{\textit{operation, position, attribute}\} to cover diverse user needs from coarse-grained to fine-grained. To facilitate the VCE task, we \textit{automatically} construct an open-domain benchmark dataset named VATEX-EDIT and \textit{manually} collect an e-commerce dataset called EMMAD-EDIT. We further propose a specialized small-scale model (i.e., OPA) compared with two generalist Large Multi-modal Models to perform an exhaustive analysis of the novel task. For evaluation, we adopt comprehensive metrics considering caption fluency, command-caption consistency, and video-caption alignment. Experiments reveal the task challenges of fine-grained multi-modal semantics understanding and processing. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are ready to be open-sourced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal selection and fusion of feature encoders across multiple modalities and combines these in one neural network to improve sentiment detection. We compare different fusion methods and examine the impact of multi-loss training within the multi-modality fusion network, identifying surprisingly important findings relating to subnet performance. We have also found that integrating context significantly enhances model performance. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance for three datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI and CH-SIMS). These results suggest a roadmap toward an optimized feature selection and fusion approach for enhancing sentiment detection in neural networks.</description>

      <title>VIEScore: Towards Explainable Metrics for Conditional Image Synthesis Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of conditional image generation research, challenges such as limited explainability lie in effectively evaluating the performance and capabilities of various models. This paper introduces VIEScore, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric for evaluating any conditional image generation tasks. VIEScore leverages general knowledge from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone and does not require training or fine-tuning. We evaluate VIEScore on seven prominent tasks in conditional image tasks and found: (1) VIEScore (GPT4-o) achieves a high Spearman correlation of 0.4 with human evaluations, while the human-to-human correlation is 0.45. (2) VIEScore (with open-source MLLM) is significantly weaker than GPT-4o and GPT-4v in evaluating synthetic images. (3) VIEScore achieves a correlation on par with human ratings in the generation tasks but struggles in editing tasks. With these results, we believe VIEScore shows its great potential to replace human judges in evaluating image synthesis tasks.</description>

      <title>NU-Class Net: A Novel Approach for Video Quality Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video content has experienced a surge in popularity, asserting its dominance over internet traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Video compression has long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the substantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices. Nevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational demands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity presents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding standards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node cameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an innovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts stemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates the perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net, the video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality, thereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both computation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which is typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied after the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality of the original video. Experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed model in enhancing the perceptible quality of videos, especially those streamed at low bit rates.</description>

      <title>WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</description>
