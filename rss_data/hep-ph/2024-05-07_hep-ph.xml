      <title>Probing SUSY at Gravitational Wave Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumption that the recent pulsar timing array evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies is generated by metastable cosmic strings, we analyze the potential of present and future GW observatories for probing the change of particle degrees of freedom caused, e.g., by a supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Standard Model (SM). We find that signs of the characteristic doubling of degrees of freedom predicted by SUSY could be detected at Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer even if the masses of the SUSY partner particles are as high as about $10^4$ TeV, far above the reach of any currently envisioned particle collider. We also discuss the detection prospects for the case that some entropy production, e.g. from a late decaying modulus field inducing a temporary matter domination phase in the evolution of the universe, somewhat dilutes the GW spectrum, delaying discovery of the stochastic GW background at LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In our analysis we focus on SUSY, but any theory beyond the SM predicting a significant increase of particle degrees of freedom could be probed this way.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Anomaly Cancellation at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a class of theories that predict a fermionic dark matter candidate from gauge anomaly cancellation. As an explicit example, we study the predictions in theories where the global symmetry associated with baryon number is promoted to a local gauge symmetry. In this context the symmetry-breaking scale has to be below the multi-TeV scale in order to be in agreement with the cosmological constraints on the dark matter relic density. The new physical "Cucuyo" Higgs boson in the theory has very interesting properties, decaying mainly into two photons in the low mass region, and mainly into dark matter in the intermediate mass region. We study the most important signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluating the experimental bounds. We discuss the correlation between the dark matter relic density, direct detection and collider constraints. We find that these theories are still viable, and are susceptible to being probed in current, and future high-luminosity, running.</description>

      <title>Higgs Portal Dark Matter Freeze-in at Stronger Coupling: Observational Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study freeze-in production of Higgs portal dark matter (DM) at temperatures far below the dark matter mass. The temperature of the Standard Model (SM) thermal bath may have never been high such that dark matter production via thermal emission has been Boltzmann suppressed. This allows for a significant coupling between the Higgs field and DM, which is being probed by the direct DM detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay searches at the LHC. We delineate the corresponding parameter space in the Higgs portal framework with dark matter of spin 0, 1/2 and 1.</description>

      <title>Charged lepton-flavor violating constraints to non-unitarity in the Linear Seesaw scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the non-unitary effects in the linear seesaw mechanism using the current constraints and future sensitivity of the charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes. We perform a random scan confronting the non-unitary parameters with the limits to the cLFV processes. We show our results for the normal and inverted ordering of the oscillation data. We also discuss the equivalence of different parametrizations of the non-unitary mixing matrix and show our results in terms of the different parameterizations. We found that the stronger restrictions in the non-unitary parameter space come from rare muon decay searches.</description>

      <title>Remark on neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillations of ultra-relativistic neutrinos are realized by the propagation of assumed zero-mass on-shell neutrinos with the speed of light in vacuum combined with the phase modulation by the small mass term $\exp[-i(m^{2}_{\nu_{k}}/2|\vec{p}|)\tau]$ with a time parameter $\tau$. This picture is realized in the first quantization by the mass expansion and in field theory by the use of $\delta(x^{0}-y^{0}-\tau) \langle 0|T^{\star}\nu_{L k}(x)\overline{\nu_{L k}(y)}|0\rangle$ with the neutrino mass eigenstates $\nu_{L k}$ and a finite positive $\tau$ after the contour integral of the propagating neutrino energies.
  By noting that the conventional detectors are insensitive to neutrino masses, the measured energy-momenta of the initial and final states with assumed zero-mass neutrinos are conserved. The propagating neutrinos preserve the three-momentum in this sense but the energies of the massive neutrinos are conserved up to uncertainty relations and thus leading to oscillations. Conceptual complications in the case of Majorana neutrinos due to the charge conjugation in $d=4$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Neutrino Wave Functions under Penrose Gravitational Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of spontaneous wave function collapse have been postulated to address the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Their primary function is to convert coherent quantum superpositions into incoherent ones, with the result that macroscopic objects cannot be placed into widely separated superpositions for observably prolonged times. Many of these processes will also lead to loss of coherence in neutrino oscillations, producing observable signatures in the flavor profile of neutrinos at long travel distances. The majority of studies of neutrino oscillation coherence to date have focused on variants of the continuous state localization model, whereby an effective decoherence strength parameter is used to model the rate of coherence loss with an assumed energy dependence. Another class of collapse models that have been proposed posit connections to the configuration of gravitational field accompanying the mass distribution associated with each wave function that is in the superposition. A particularly interesting and prescriptive model is Penrose's description of gravitational collapse which proposes a decoherence time $\tau$ determined through $E_{g}\tau\sim\hbar$, where $E_{g}$ is a calculable function of the Newtonian gravitational potential. Here we explore application of the Penrose collapse model to neutrino oscillations, reinterpreting previous experimental limits on neutrino decoherence in terms of this model. We identify effects associated with both spatial collapse and momentum diffusion, finding that the latter is ruled out in data from the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory so long as the neutrino wave packet width at production is $\sigma_{\nu,x}\leq2\times10^{-12}$ m.</description>

      <title>Baryonic thermal screening mass at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the resummed 1-loop correction to a baryonic thermal screening mass. The calculation is carried out in the framework of a dimensionally reduced effective theory, where quarks are heavy fields due to their non-zero Matsubara frequencies. The correction due to interactions is computed at O($g^2_{ }$) in the coupling constant. In order to solve a 3-body Schr\"odinger equation, we exploit a two-dimensional generalization of the hyperspherical harmonics method. At electroweak scale temperatures, the NLO correction represents a $\sim 4.6 \%$ increase of the free-theory value $3\pi T$ of the screening mass.</description>

      <title>Finite modular majoron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the accidental $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry can arise from a finite modular symmetry $\Gamma_N$ in the type-I seesaw. The finite modular symmetry is spontaneously broken in such a way that the residual $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ discrete symmetry, associated with the $T$-transformation which shifts the modulus $\tau \to \tau+ 1$, remains unbroken. This discrete $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ symmetry mimics $U(1)_{B-L}$, and hence the majoron appears as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of $U(1)_{B-L}$. Without introducing additional interactions, the modulus $\tau$ can be stabilized by the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential given by the Majorana mass terms of the right-handed neutrinos. We study cosmological implications of the majoron, with particular interests in the dark matter and dark radiation, where the latter may alleviate the Hubble tension. We also find that the CW potential can have a wide range of nearly exponential shape which prevents $\tau$ from overshooting, and makes the amount of dark radiation not too large.</description>

      <title>Lam-Tung relation breaking in $Z$ boson production as a probe of SMEFT effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of Lam-Tung relation in the high-$p_T^{\ell\ell}$ region of the Drell-Yan process at the LHC presents a long-standing discrepancy with the standard model prediction at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ accuracy. In this Letter, we employed a model-independent analysis to investigate this anomaly within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Our findings revealed that the leading contributions from SMEFT to this violation appear at the $1/\Lambda^4$ order with $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ accuracy in QCD interaction. Notably, we demonstrated that the quadratic effect of dimension-6 dipole operators, associated with the $Z$ boson, dominates the breaking effects induced by various dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators. This provides a compelling explanation for the observed discrepancy with the Standard Model predictions at the LHC without assuming other new physics operators, and thereby offers the potential to extract valuable information about the underlying physics at the TeV scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we choose diquark-antidiquark type four-quark currents with an explicit P-wave to study the ground states and first radial excitations of the hidden-charm tetraquark states with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}$. And we obtain the lowest vector tetraquark masses and make possible assignments of the existing $Y$ states. There indeed exists a hidden-charm tetraquark state with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ at the energy about $4.75\,\rm{GeV}$ as the first radial excitation to account for the BESIII data.</description>

      <title>Constraining the mass-spectra in the presence of a light sterile neutrino from absolute mass-related observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillation is a well-established phenomenon, but results from the short-baseline experiments, such as the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) and MiniBooster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE), hint at the potential existence of an additional light neutrino state characterized by a mass-squared difference of approximately $1\,\rm eV^2$. The new neutrino state is devoid of all Standard Model (SM) interactions, commonly referred to as a 'sterile' state. In addition, a sterile neutrino with a mass-squared difference of $10^{-2}$ $\rm eV^2$ has been proposed to improve the tension between the results obtained from the Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) and the NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance (NO$\nu$A) experiments. Further, the non-observation of the predicted upturn in the solar neutrino spectra below 8 MeV can be explained by postulating an extra light sterile neutrino state with a mass-squared difference around $10^{-5} \rm eV^2$. The hypothesis of an additional light sterile neutrino state introduces four distinct mass spectra depending on the sign of the mass-squared difference. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the above scenarios on the observables that depend on the absolute mass of the neutrinos, namely the sum of the light neutrino masses $(\Sigma)$ from cosmology, the effective mass of the electron neutrino from beta decay $(m_{\beta})$, and the effective Majorana mass $( m_{\beta\beta})$ from neutrinoless double beta decay. We show that some scenarios can be disfavored by the current constraints of the above variables. The implications for projected sensitivity of Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) and future experiments like Project-8, next Enriched Xenon Observatory (nEXO) have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Properties of the Proton Structure at Low x within the \textbf{xFitter} framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the proton exhibits Fractal behavior at low \textit{x}, where \textit{x} is the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the interacting partons. This Fractal behavior is characterized by self-similar properties at different scales and can be quantified using the concept of Fractal dimension. An investigation into the Fractal properties of the proton structure at low \textit{x} is critical for understanding the fundamental properties of the strong force and developing a more comprehensive understanding of the hadron structure. Fractals, characterized by self-similar patterns across scales, demonstrate a direct correlation between their Fractal dimension and entropy, where higher Fractal dimensions correspond to increased informational content. Furthermore, it is essential for designing high-energy physics experiments and developing more accurate models of subatomic particle interactions. This paper has a fresh look at the self-similar properties of the proton structure at low \textit{x}. Our study involves the use of the \textbf{xFitter} framework to parameterize the proton structure functions with a Fractal formalism at low \textit{x}. We also examine how the inclusion of new data affects the results of our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the single-inclusive production of prompt photons in electron proton collisions, $ep \to \gamma X $, for kinematics relevant at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We perform a perturbative calculation of the differential cross section to next-to-leading order in QCD and to lowest order in QED. We consider unpolarized collisions as well as scattering of longitudinally polarized incident electrons and protons. We show that the cross sections are sensitive to the parton distribution functions of photons inside the proton, which we find to generate the dominant contributions in certain kinematical regions at the EIC. We also investigate the effects of photon isolation on the unpolarized and polarized cross sections.</description>

      <title>Investigations on the weak decays of $D\bar{B}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decays of exotic states discovered experimentally always proceed via the strong and electromagnetic interactions. Recently, a tetraquark state with the quark content $bc\bar{q}\bar{q}$ was predicted by Lattice QCD simulations. It is below the mass threshold of $D\bar{B}$, which can only decay via the weak interaction. In this work, based on the decay mechanism of $T_{cc}$ as a $DD^*$ molecule, we propose that the decays of the $bc\bar{q}\bar{q}$ tertaquark state as a $D\bar{B}$ molecule proceed via the Cabibbo-favored weak decays of the $\bar{B}$ or $D$ meson, accompanied by the tree-level decay modes and the triangle decay modes. Our results indicate that the branching fraction of the $D\bar{B}$ molecule decaying into $\pi^+ K^{-} \bar{B}^0$ is sizable, which is a good channel to observe the $D\bar{B}$ molecule in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how topologically stable superheavy magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes can be generated at observable levels by the waterfall field in hybrid inflation models based on grand unified theories. In $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ grand unification, the monopole mass is of order $4 \times 10^{17}$ GeV, and it carries a single unit ($2 \pi /e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as screened color magnetic charge. The monopole density is partially diluted to an observable value, and accompanied with the production of primordial black holes with mass of order $10^{17}$-$10^{19}$ g which may make up the entire dark matter in the universe. The tensor to scalar ratio $r$ is predicted to be of order $10^{-5}$ - $10^{-4}$ which should be testable in the next generation of CMB experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. The gravitational wave spectrum generated during the waterfall transition is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <title>Transition of dimuonium through foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a study of the passage of dimuonium through the foil of ordinary matter. First, we provide an overview of how dimuonium is planned to be produced for such a type of experiment and how it is expected to interact with the ordinary atoms -- predominantly electromagnetically via the screened coulomb potential of the atomic nuclei. Then, we describe the transport equations that represent the evolution of dimuonium states during the passage and their solution methods. Finally, for three different foils (Beryllium, Aluminium and Lead), we present the results of this study. To estimate impact of uncertainties in the potential of a target atom, we study 15 different approximations of the atomic potential and show that the corresponding atomic-potential-model-dependent error in the yields of the low lying states of dimuonium is quite small within the framework of the applied Born approximation. The convergence of the results after truncation of the infinite system of transport equations to the finite number of quantum states of dimuonium is also studied, and good convergence for the yields of low-lying states is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Percolating Cosmic String loops from evaporating primordial black holes</title>

Abstract: The Pulsar timing data from NANOGrav Collaboration has regenerated interest in the possibility of observing stochastic gravitational wave background arising from cosmic strings. In the standard theory, the cosmic string network forms during spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase transition in the whole universe via the so called Kibble mechanism. This scenario would not be possible, e.g., in models of low energy inflation, where the reheat temperature is much lower than the energy scale of cosmic strings. We point out a very different possibility, where a network of even high energy scale cosmic strings can form when the temperature of the Universe is much lower. We consider local heating of plasma in the early universe by evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). It is known that for suitable masses of PBHs, their Hawking radiation may re-heat the surrounding plasma to high temperatures, restoring certain symmetries {\it locally} which are broken at the ambient temperature at that stage. Expansion of the hot plasma cools it so that the {\it locally restored symmetry} is spontaneously broken again. If this SSB supports formation of cosmic strings, then string loops will form in this region around the PBH. Further, resulting temperature gradients lead to pressure gradients such that plasma develops radial flow with the string loops getting stretched as they get dragged by the flow. For a finite density of PBHs of suitable masses, one will get local hot spots, each one contributing to expanding cosmic string loops. For suitable PBH density, the loops from different regions may intersect. Intercommutation of strings can then lead to percolation, leading to the possibility of formation of infinite string network, even when the entire universe never goes through the respective SSB phase transition.</description>

      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <title>Assessing observational constraints on dark energy</title>

Abstract: Observational constraints on time-varying dark energy ({\it e.g.}, quintessence) are commonly presented on a $w_0$-$w_a$ plot that assumes the equation of state of dark energy strictly satisfies $w(z)= w_0+ w_a z/(1+z)$ as a function of the redshift $z$. Recent observations favor a sector of the $w_0$-$w_a$ plane in which $w_0 &gt; -1$ and $w_0+w_a&lt; -1$, suggesting that the equation of state underwent a transition from violating the null energy condition (NEC) at large $z$ to obeying it at small $z$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this impression is misleading by showing that simple quintessence models satisfying the NEC for all $z$ predict an observational preference for the same sector. We also find that quintessence models that best fit observational data can predict a value for the dark energy equation of state at present that is significantly different from the best-fit value of $w_0$ obtained assuming the parameterization above. In addition, the analysis reveals an approximate degeneracy of the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameterization that explains the eccentricity and orientation of the likelihood contours presented in recent observational studies.</description>

      <title>MEET-U Project I: The key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both the SNe and BAO data contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>$1/N$ Corrections in $\text{QCD}_2$: Small Mass Limit and Threshold States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $1/N$ corrections to mesonic spectrum in $1+1$-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ($\text{QCD}_2$) with fundamental quarks using effective Hamiltonian method. We express the corrections in terms of 't Hooft equation solutions. First, we consider 2-flavor model with a heavy and a light quark. We show that, in contrast to some claims in earlier literature, the $1/N$ correction to the mass of the heavy-light meson remains finite when the light quark mass is taken to zero. Nevertheless, the corrections become significantly larger in this limit; we attribute this to the presence of massless modes in the spectrum. We also study the corrections to the lightest meson mass in 1-flavor model and show that they are consistent with recent numerical data, but not with the prediction coming from bosonization. Then we study low energy effective theory for 2 flavors. We show that the 3-meson interaction vertex correctly reproduces Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) coupling when both quarks become massless. This coupling does not change even if one of the quarks is massive. We employ Discretized Light Cone Quatization (DLCQ) to check the continuum results and show that the improved version can be used for small quark mass. Finally, we study the states associated with $1\to 2$ meson thresholds. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that when the decay is allowed by parity, the infinite $N$ theory has near-threshold bound states that mix one- and two-meson parts. They are $1/3$ two-meson and $2/3$ one-meson and the corrections to their masses have unusual scaling $\sim 1/N^{2/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of temporal properties of variable sources can elucidate their physical processes. In this context, we present a critical study comparing three approaches to periodic or quasiperiodic behavior: Gaussian process, power spectrum, and wavelet analysis, using celerite, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and weighted wavelet-Z transforms, respectively. We use 15 Swift-X-ray Telescope light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) as examples. A comprehensive analysis of two sGRB X-ray light curves is performed. The results reveal the importance of artifacts, largely in the form of false quasiperiodic oscillation signals, possibly introduced by preprocessing (such as detrending) or other aspects of the analysis. The exploration described in this paper can be helpful for future studies of variability in GRBs, active galactic nuclei, and other astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>Baryonic screening masses in QCD at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the baryonic screening masses with nucleon quantum numbers and its negative parity partner in thermal QCD with $N_f=3$ massless quarks for a wide range of temperatures, from $T \sim 1$ GeV up to $\sim 160$ GeV. The computation is performed by Monte Carlo simulations of lattice QCD with $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions by exploiting a recently proposed strategy to study non-perturbatively QCD at very high temperature. Very large spatial extensions are considered in order to have negligible finite volume effects. For each temperature we have simulated $3$ or $4$ values of the lattice spacing, so as to perform the continuum limit extrapolation with confidence at a few permille accuracy. The degeneracy of the positive and negative parity-state screening masses, expected from Ward identities associated to non-singlet axial transformations, provides further evidence for the restoration of chiral symmetry in the high temperature regime of QCD. In the entire range of temperatures explored, the baryonic masses deviate from the free theory result, $3 \pi T$, by $4$-$8\%$. The contribution due to the interactions is clearly visible up to the highest temperature considered, and cannot be explained by the expected leading behavior in the QCD coupling constant $g$ over the entire range of temperatures explored.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation experiments with style-based quantum generative adversarial networks on trapped-ion and superconducting-qubit technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current noisy intermediate scale quantum computing era, and after the significant progress of the quantum hardware we have seen in the past few years, it is of high importance to understand how different quantum algorithms behave on different types of hardware. This includes whether or not they can be implemented at all and, if so, what the quality of the results is. This work quantitatively demonstrates, for the first time, how the quantum generator architecture for the style-based quantum generative adversarial network (qGAN) can not only be implemented but also yield good results on two very different types of hardware for data augmentation: the IBM bm_torino quantum computer based on the Heron chip using superconducting transmon qubits and the aria-1 IonQ quantum computer based on trapped-ion qubits. The style-based qGAN, proposed in 2022, generalizes the state of the art for qGANs and allows for shallow-depth networks. The results obtained on both devices are of comparable quality, with the aria-1 device delivering somewhat more accurate results than the ibm_torino device, while the runtime on ibm_torino is significantly shorter than on aria-1. Parallelization of the circuits, using up to 48 qubits on IBM quantum systems and up to 24 qubits on the IonQ system, is also presented, reducing the number of submitted jobs and allowing for a substantial reduction of the runtime on the quantum processor to generate the total number of samples.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions from the pseudo-distribution approach on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are key quantities for the description of a hadron's three-dimensional structure. They are the current focus of all areas of hadronic physics -- phenomenological, experimental, and theoretical, including lattice QCD. Synergies between these areas are desirable and essential to achieve precise quantification and understanding of the structure of, particularly nucleons, as the basic ingredients of matter. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the numerical implementation of the pseudo-distribution approach for the extraction of zero-skewness GPDs for unpolarized quarks. Pseudo-distributions are Euclidean parton correlators computable in lattice QCD that can be perturbatively matched to the light-cone parton distributions of interest. Being closely related to the quasi-distributions and coming from the same lattice-extracted matrix elements, they are, however, subject to different systematic effects. We use the data previously utilized for quasi-GPDs and extend it with other momentum transfers and nucleon boosts, in particular a higher one ($P_3=1.67$ GeV) with eight-fold larger statistics than the largest one used for quasi-distributions ($P_3=1.25$ GeV). We renormalize the matrix elements with a ratio scheme and match the resulting Ioffe time distributions to the light cone in coordinate space. The matched distributions are then used to reconstruct the $x$-dependence with a fitting ansatz.We investigate some systematic effects related to this procedure, and we also compare the results with the ones obtained in the framework of quasi-GPDs. Our final results involve the invariant four-momentum transfer squared ($-t$) dependence of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) $H$ and $E$ GPDs.</description>

Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01964v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to account for neutrino masses at the two-loop level. This mechanism introduces new scalars and Majorana fermions to the Standard Model. It is assumed the existence of a global $\mathrm{U(1)\times \mathcal{Z}_2}$ symmetry which after partial breaking provides the stability of the dark matter candidates of the theory. The rich structure of the potential allows for the possibility of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe which can lead to the generation of primordial gravitational waves as one of the potentially observable signatures of this model. Taking into account relevant constraints from lepton flavour violation, neutrino physics as well as the trilinear Higgs couplings at next-to-leading order accuracy, we have found a wide range of possible FOPTs which are strong enough to be probed at the proposed gravitational-wave interferometer experiments such as LISA.</description>

Abstract: Complete anomaly detection strategies that are both signal sensitive and compatible with background estimation have largely focused on resonant signals. Non-resonant new physics scenarios are relatively under-explored and may arise from off-shell effects or final states with significant missing energy. In this paper, we extend a class of weakly supervised anomaly detection strategies developed for resonant physics to the non-resonant case. Machine learning models are trained to reweight, generate, or morph the background, extrapolated from a control region. A classifier is then trained in a signal region to distinguish the estimated background from the data. The new methods are demonstrated using a semi-visible jet signature as a benchmark signal model, and are shown to automatically identify the anomalous events without specifying the signal ahead of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The addition of $d=5$ operators to the Seesaw model leads to the Dimension-5 Seesaw Portal. Here, two new operators provide interactions for the heavy sterile neutrinos. In particular, the Higgs boson can have a large branching ratio into two heavy neutrinos, meaning that these states can be searched for at the LHC. Moreover, the heavy neutrinos can now decay dominantly into light neutrinos and photons. If the heavy neutrinos are long-lived, then searches for delayed, non-pointing photons can constrain the model. In this work, we carry out a detailed recast of an ATLAS search for such displaced photons, triggered by a charged lepton produced in association to the Higgs, placing bounds on the branching ratio for Higgs decay into two heavy neutrinos as low as 2%.</description>

      <title>Maximising CP Violation in Naturally Aligned Two-Higgs Doublet Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is a well-motivated theoretical framework that provides additional sources of CP Violation (CPV) beyond the Standard Model (SM). After studying the vacuum topology of a general (convex) 2HDM potential, we unambiguously identify three origins of CPV: (I) Spontaneous CPV (SCPV), where the vacuum manifold has at least two degenerate CPV minima disconnected by domain walls, (ii) Explicit CPV (ECPV) with one single CPV ground state, and (iii) Mixed Spontaneous and Explicit CPV (MCPV), where the theory possesses more than one $non$-degenerate CPV local minimum. Most importantly, we define a novel complex parameter $r_{\rm CP}$ whose norm and phase control the three different realisations of CPV, at least at the tree level. In all these scenarios, only two CPV phases can be made independent, as any third CPV parameter will always be constrained via the CP-odd tadpole condition. Since ECPV vanishes in 2HDMs where SM Higgs alignment is achieved naturally through accidental continuous symmetries, we analyse the possibility of maximising CPV through soft and explicit breaking of these symmetries. We derive upper limits on key CPV parameters that quantify the degree of SM misalignment from constraints due to the non-observation of an electron Electric Dipole Moment (EDM). Finally, we delineate the CP-violating parameter space of the so-constrained naturally aligned 2HDMs that can further be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss the electromagnetic properties of the $S$-wave and $D$-wave $T^+_{cc}$ molecular states, which include the magnetic moments, transition magnetic moments and radiative decay widths. According to our results, the magnetic moment of $T^+_{cc}$ state observed experimentally is $-0.09\mu_N$. Meanwhile, we also discuss the relations between the transition magnetic moments of the $S$-wave $T^+_{cc}$ molecular states and the radiative decay widths, and we analyze the proportionality between the magnetic moments of the $T^+_{cc}$ molecular states. These results provide further information on the inner structure of $T^+_{cc}$ molecular states and deepen the understanding of electromagnetic properties of doubly charmed tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>New 511 keV line data provides strongest sub-GeV dark matter constraints</title>

Abstract: We explore the $511$~keV emission associated to sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles that can produce electron-positron pairs and form positronium after thermalizing. We use $\sim16$~yr of SPI data from INTEGRAL to constrain DM properties, considering the full positron propagation and losses, and the free electron density drop away from the Galactic plane. We show that the predicted longitude and latitude profiles vary significantly for different DM masses, unlike previous assumptions, and obtain the strongest limits on sub-GeV DM (from the MeV to a few GeV) so far, excluding cross-sections down to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim10^{-32}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for $m_{\chi}\sim1\,\text{MeV}$ and $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1} $ for $m_{\chi}\sim5\,\text{GeV}$ and lifetimes up to $\tau \gtrsim 10^{29}\, \textrm{s} \, (m_{\chi}\sim1\,\text{MeV}) $ and $\tau \gtrsim 10^{27}\,\textrm{s}$ ($m_{\chi}\sim5$~GeV) for the typical Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile. Our derived limits are robust within a factor of a few due to systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators in gradient flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators are constructed using local operators connected by time-like or space-like Wilson lines, which ensure gauge invariance. Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators have broad applications in various contexts. For instance, space-like Wilson-line operators play a crucial role in determining quasi-distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), while time-like Wilson-line operators are essential for understanding quarkonium decay and production within the potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) framework. In this work, we establish a systematic approach for calculating the matching from the gradient-flow scheme to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme in the limit of small flow time for off-lightcone Wilson-line operators. By employing the one-dimensional auxiliary-field formalism, we simplify the matching procedure, reducing it to the matching of local current operators. We provide one-loop level matching coefficients for these local current operators. For the case of hadronic matrix element related to the quark quasi-PDFs, we show at one-loop level that the finite flow time effect is very small as long as the flow radius is smaller than the physical distance $z$, which is usually satisfied in lattice gradient flow computations. Applications include lattice gradient flow computations of quark/gluon quasi-PDFs, gluonic correlators related to quarkonium decay and production in pNRQCD, and spin-dependent potentials in terms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions into a Wilson loop.</description>

      <title>Compact objects in and beyond the Standard Model from non-perturbative vacuum scalarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a theory in which a real scalar field is Yukawa-coupled to a fermion and has a potential with two non-degenerate vacua. If the coupling is sufficiently strong, a collection of N fermions deforms the true vacuum state, creating energetically-favored false-vacuum pockets in which fermions are trapped. We embed this model within General Relativity and prove that it admits self-gravitating compact objects where the scalar field acquires a non-trivial profile due to non-perturbative effects. We discuss some applications of this general mechanism: i) neutron soliton stars in low-energy effective QCD, which naturally happen to have masses around 2 solar masses and radii around 10 km even without neutron interactions; ii) Higgs false-vacuum pockets in and beyond the Standard Model; iii) dark soliton stars in models with a dark sector. In the latter two examples, we find compelling solutions naturally describing centimeter-size compact objects with masses around 10^-6 solar masses, intriguingly in a range compatible with the OGLE+HSC microlensing anomaly. Besides these interesting examples, the mechanism of non-perturbative vacuum scalarization may play a role in various contexts in and beyond the Standard Model, providing a support mechanism for new compact objects that can form in the early universe, can collapse into primordial black holes through accretion past their maximum mass, and serve as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze data on $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ decays in the whole dilepton invariant mass spectrum with the aim of disentangling short- vs. long-distance contributions. The sizable long-distance amplitudes from $c \bar{c}$ narrow resonances are taken into account by employing a dispersive approach. For each available $q^2=m_{\mu\mu}^2$ bin and each helicity amplitude an independent determination of the Wilson coefficient $C_9$, describing $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions at short distances, is obtained. The consistency of the $C_9$ values thus obtained provides an a posteriori check of the absence of additional, sizable, long-distance contributions. The systematic difference of these values from the Standard Model expectation supports the hypothesis of a non-standard $b\to s \mu^+\mu^-$ amplitude of short-distance origin.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in the early universe: Stable magnetic monopoles from metastable cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for producing topologically stable monopoles (TSMs) from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe. In an $SO(10)$ model this mechanism yields TSMs that carry two units ($4\pi/e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as some color magnetic charge which is screened. For a dimensionless string tension parameter $G\mu \approx 10^{-9} - 10^{-5}$, the monopoles are superheavy with masses of order $10^{15} - 10^{17}$ GeV. Monopoles with masses of order $10^8 - 10^{14}$ GeV arise from metastable strings for $G\mu$ values from $\sim 10^{-22}$ to $10^{-10}$. We identify the parameter space for producing these monopoles at an observable level with detectors such as IceCube and KM3NeT. For lower $G\mu$ values the ultra-relativistic monopoles should be detectable at Pierre Auger and ANITA. The stochastic gravitational wave emission arises from metastable strings with $G\mu\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ and should be accessible at HLVK and future detectors including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. An $E_6$ extension based on this framework would yield TSMs from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable strings that carry three units ($6\pi/e$) of Dirac magnetic charge.</description>

      <title>Probing the Gauge-boson Couplings of Axion-like Particle at the LHC and High-Luminosity LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the sensitivities on the gauge-boson couplings $g_{aZZ}$, $g_{aZ\gamma}$, and $g_{aWW}$ of an axion-like particle (ALP) that one can achieve at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and integrated luminosities of 300 fb$^{-1}$ (current run) and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ (High-Luminosity LHC). We focus on the associated production processes $pp\to Za \to (l^+l^-)(\gamma\gamma)$ and $pp\to W^\pm a \to (l^\pm \nu)(\gamma\gamma)$. We show that better sensitivities on these gauge couplings can be achieved at the LHC for $M_a = 1-100$ GeV, down to the level of $10^{-4}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the significance of the investigated channels in constraining the ALP couplings at the LHC, offering valuable insights for future experiments dedicated to ALP detection.</description>

      <title>How higher charmonia shape the puzzling data of the $e^+e^-\to \eta J/\psi$ cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration performed a precise measurement of the $e^+e^-\to \eta J/\psi$ cross section. It is puzzling that the resonance parameters of the reported $Y(4230)$ show a substantial divergence from the previously measured results in both the open-charmed and hidden-charmed decay channels, and the line shape asymmetry of the data approaching 4.2 GeV also suggests that it might be difficult to characterize the details of the structure around 4.2 GeV by a single resonance. This has motivated our great curiosity about how the charmonium states are distributed in the measured energy range and how they shape the puzzling data of the $e^+e^-\to \eta J/\psi$ cross section. In this work, we use five theoretically constructed charmonia in the range of $4.0\sim4.5$ $\text{GeV}$, i.e., $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4220)$, $\psi(4380)$, and $\psi(4415)$, to apply a combined fit to the data, in which their calculated decay ratios into $\eta J/\psi$ via hadronic loop mechanism are taken as input. The fit results can reproduce the measured cross section data well, especially for the subtle line shape around 4.2 GeV, showing that the structure around 4.2 GeV is possible from the contribution of both $\psi(4160)$ and $\psi(4220)$.</description>

      <title>Consistency of pion form factor and unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions beyond leading twist in the light-front quark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay among the pion's form factor, transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs) extending our light-front quark model (LFQM) computation based on the Bakamjian-Thomas construction for the two-point function[41,42] to the three-point and four-point functions. Ensuring the four-momentum conservation at the meson-quark vertex from the Bakamjian-Thomas construction, the meson mass is taken consistently as the corresponding invariant meson mass both in the matrix element and the Lorentz factor in our LFQM computation. We achieve the current-component independence in the physical observables such as the pion form factor and delve into the derivation of unpolarized TMDs and PDFs associated with the forward matrix element. We address the challenges posed by twist-4 TMDs and exhibit the fulfillment of the sum rule. Effectively, our LFQM successfully handles the light-front zero modes and offers insights for broader three-point and four-point functions and related observables.</description>

      <title>Implications of purity constraints on light higgsinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lightest supersymmetric particles could be higgsinos that have a small mixing with gauginos. If the lightest higgsino-like state makes up some or all of the dark matter with a thermal freezeout density, then its mass must be between about 100 and 1150 GeV, and dark matter searches put bounds on the amount of gaugino contamination that it can have. Motivated by the generally good agreement of flavor- and CP-violating observables with Standard Model predictions, I consider models in which the scalar particles of minimal supersymmetry are heavy enough to be essentially decoupled, except for the 125 GeV Higgs boson. I survey the resulting purity constraints as lower bounds on the gaugino masses and upper bounds on the higgsino mass splittings. I also discuss the mild excesses in recent soft lepton searches for charginos and neutralinos at the LHC, and show that they can be accommodated in these models if $\tan\beta$ is small and $\mu$ is negative.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Attention-based transformer models have become increasingly prevalent in collider analysis, offering enhanced performance for tasks such as jet tagging. However, they are computationally intensive and require substantial data for training. In this paper, we introduce a new jet classification network using an MLP mixer, where two subsequent MLP operations serve to transform particle and feature tokens over the jet constituents. The transformed particles are combined with subjet information using multi-head cross-attention so that the network is invariant under the permutation of the jet constituents.
  We utilize two clustering algorithms to identify subjets: the standard sequential recombination algorithms with fixed radius parameters and a new IRC-safe, density-based algorithm of dynamic radii based on HDBSCAN. The proposed network demonstrates comparable classification performance to state-of-the-art models while boosting computational efficiency drastically. Finally, we evaluate the network performance using various interpretable methods, including centred kernel alignment and attention maps, to highlight network efficacy in collider analysis tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate six helicity amplitudes of the four-body $B_{(s)} \to (\pi\pi)(K\bar{K})$ decays in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The $\pi\pi$ invariant mass spectrum is dominated by the vector resonance $\rho(770)$ together with scalar resonance $f_0(980)$, while the vector resonance $\phi(1020)$ and scalar resonance $f_0(980)$ are expected to contribute in the $K\bar{K}$ invariant mass range. We extract the two-body branching ratios ${\cal B}(B_{(s)}\to \rho\phi)$ from the corresponding four-body decays $B_{(s)}\to \rho\phi\to (\pi\pi)(K \bar K)$. The predicted ${\cal B}(B^0_{s}\to \rho\phi)$ agrees well with the current experimental data within errors. The longitudinal polarization fractions of the $B_{(s)}\to \rho\phi$ decays are found to be as large as $90\%$, basically consistent with the previous two-body predictions within uncertainties. In addition, the triple-product asymmetries (TPAs) of the considered decays are also presented for the first time. Since the $B_s^0\to \rho^0\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^+K^-)$ decay is induced by both tree and penguin operators, the values of the ${\cal A}^{\rm CP}_{\rm dir}$ and ${\cal A}^{1}_{\text{T-true}}$ are calculated to be $(21.8^{+2.7}_{-3.3})\%$ and $(-10.23^{+1.73}_{-1.56})\%$ respectively. While for pure penguin decays $B^0\to \rho^0\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^+K^-)$ and $B^+\to \rho^+\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^0)(K^+K^-)$, both the direct $CP$ asymmetries and ``true" TPAs are naturally expected to be zero in the standard model (SM). The ``fake" TPAs requiring no weak phase difference are usually none zero for all considered decay channels. The sizable ``fake" ${\cal A}^{1}_{\text{T-fake}}=(-20.92^{+6.26}_{-2.80})\%$ of the $B^0\to \rho^0\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^+K^-)$ decay is predicted in the PQCD approach, which provides valuable information on the final-state interactions.Our predictions can be tested by the future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compile a catalog of 578 highly probable and 62 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates designed for continuous follow-up to date. We match distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compare to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantify contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we study the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Novel tests of gravity using nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational-wave background signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity theories that modify General Relativity in the slow-motion regime can introduce nonperturbative corrections to the stochastic gravitational-wave background~(SGWB) from supermassive black-hole binaries in the nano-Hertz band, while remaining perturbative in the highly-relativistic regime and satisfying current post-Newtonian~(PN) constraints. We present a model-agnostic formalism to map such theories into a modified tilt for the SGWB spectrum, showing that negative PN corrections (in particular -2PN) can alleviate the tension in the recent pulsar-timing-array data if the detected SGWB is interpreted as arising from supermassive binaries. Despite being preliminary, current data have already strong constraining power, for example they set a novel (conservative) upper bound on theories with time-varying Newton's constant at least at the level of $\dot{G}/G \lesssim 10^{-5} \text{yr}^{-1}$ for redshift $z=[0.1\div1]$. We also show that NANOGrav data are best fitted by a broken power-law interpolating between a dominant -2PN or -3PN modification at low frequency, and the standard general-relativity scaling at high frequency. Nonetheless, a modified gravity explanation should be confronted with binary eccentricity, environmental effects, nonastrophysical origins of the signal, and scrutinized against statistical uncertainties. These novel tests of gravity will soon become more stringent when combining all pulsar-timing-array facilities and when collecting more data.</description>

      <title>Catalog variance of testing general relativity with gravitational-wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining multiple gravitational-wave observations allows for stringent tests of general relativity, targeting effects that would otherwise be undetectable using single-event analyses. We highlight how the finite size of the observed catalog induces a significant source of variance. If not appropriately accounted for, general relativity can be excluded with arbitrarily large credibility even if it is the underlying theory of gravity. This effect is generic and holds for arbitrarily large catalogs. Moreover, we show that it cannot be suppressed by selecting "golden" observations with large signal-to-noise ratios. We present a mitigation strategy based on bootstrapping (i.e. resampling with repetition) that allows assigning uncertainties to one's credibility on the targeted test. We demonstrate our findings using both toy models and real gravitational-wave data. In particular, we quantify the impact of the catalog variance on the ringdown properties of black holes using the latest LIGO/Virgo catalog.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Anomalies: A Window into Baryon Number Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a specific class of slow Baryon Number Violation (BNV) -- one that induces quasi-equilibrium evolution -- on pulsar spin characteristics. This work reveals how BNV can potentially alter observable parameters, including spin-down rates, the second derivative of spin frequency, and braking indices of pulsars. Moreover, we demonstrate that BNV could lead to anomalies in pulsar timing, along with a wide array of braking indices, both positive and negative. In addition, we examine the possibility of pulsar spin-up due to BNV, which may result in a novel mechanism for the revival of ``dead'' pulsars. We conclude by assessing the sensitivity required for future pulsar timing efforts to detect such BNV effects, thus highlighting the potential for pulsars to serve as laboratories for testing fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Dilepton production at next-to-leading order and intermediate invariant-mass observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal QCD dilepton production rate is calculated at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling and at finite baryon chemical potential. The two-loop virtual photon self-energy is evaluated using finite temperature field theory and combined consistently with the self-energy in the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime. We present new results for a dense baryonic plasma. The rates are then integrated using (3+1)-dimensional fluid-dynamical simulations calibrated to reproduce hadronic experimental results obtained at RHIC at energies ranging from those of the Beam Energy Scan to $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV. We elaborate on the ability for dileptons to relay information about the plasma baryonic content and temperature.</description>

      <title>On the phase structure of extra-dimensional gauge theories with fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of five-dimensional Yang-Mills theories coupled to Dirac fermions. In order to tackle their non-perturbative character, we derive the flow equations for the gauge coupling and the effective potential for the Aharonov-Bohm phases employing the Functional Renormalisation Group. We analyse the infrared and ultraviolet fixed-point solutions in the flow of the gauge coupling as a function of the compactification radius of the fifth dimension. We discuss various types of trajectories which smoothly connect both dimensional limits. Last, we investigate the phase diagram and vacuum structure of the gauge potential for different fermion content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the cosmological field equations in Symmetric Teleparallel General Relativity, where a nonlinear function of the boundary term is introduced instead of the cosmological constant to describe the acceleration phase of the universe. Our analysis reveals constraints on the free parameters necessary for the existence of an attractor that accurately represents acceleration. However, we also identify asymptotic solutions depicting Big Rip and Big Crunch singularities. To avoid these solutions, we must impose constraints on the phase-space, requiring specific initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Bubble-wall velocity in local thermal equilibrium: hydrodynamical simulations vs analytical treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform real-time hydrodynamical simulations of the growth of bubbles formed during cosmological first-order phase transitions under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium. We confirm that pure hydrodynamic backreaction can lead to steady-state expansion and that bubble-wall velocity in such case agrees very well with the analytical estimates. However, this is not the generic outcome. Instead, it is much more common to observe runaways, as the early-stage dynamics right after the nucleation allow the bubble walls to achieve supersonic velocities before the heated fluid shell in front of the bubble is formed. This effect is not captured by other methods of calculation of the bubble-wall velocity which assume stationary solutions to exist at all times and would have a crucial impact on the possible generation of both baryon asymmetry and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Gradient Properties of Perturbative Multiscalar RG Flows to Six Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) flow of multiscalar theories is examined perturbatively in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Such theories undergo RG flows in the space of quartic couplings $\lambda^I$. Starting at five loops, the relevant vector field that determines the physical RG flow is not the beta function traditionally computed in a minimal subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation, but a suitable modification of it, the $B$ function. It is found that up to five loops the $B$ vector field is gradient, i.e. $B^I=G^{IJ}\partial A / \partial\lambda^J$ with $A$ a scalar and $G_{IJ}$ a rank-two symmetric tensor of the couplings. Up to five loops the beta function is also gradient, but it fails to be so at six loops. The conditions under which the $B$ function (and hence the RG flow) is gradient at six loops are specified, but their verification rests on a separate six-loop computation that remains to be performed.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves: all contributions from primordial non-Gaussianity $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the primordial non-Gaussianity of inflationary perturbations is crucial for testing the inflation paradigm of the early universe. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the presence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$, deriving their semi-analytical formulae for the first time. Our findings indicate that it is the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity that leads to a non-Gaussian SIGW background, suggesting that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of SIGWs could serve as probes of the primordial non-Gaussianity. Our numerical results further illustrate that $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$ exert significant impacts on the spectral amplitudes, potentially reaching up to $10^{-5}$ for the former and $10^{-8}$ for the latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum exhibit characteristic dependence on the angular multipoles and frequency bands. They hold potentials to be measured by gravitational-wave detectors that may advance our understanding of the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set, assuming the Rindler bath is composed of microscopic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the Unruh-thermalized CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set from the point of view of a diphoton Rindler bath. Under the assumption that these Hawking-Unruh diphoton pairs are microscopic trans-Planckian black holes, we find the resultant heat capacity describes the measured energy spectrum and is thus a dual description of the data set. Then, employing an n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann analysis, we find the power radiated by a black hole in the standard 3+1 spacetime dimensions in complete agreement with the data. Finally, we utilize this power spectrum to directly measure Newtons constant of gravitation.</description>
