      <title>Asset Pricing in Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative Transformer model, Single-directional representative from Transformer (SERT), for US large capital stock pricing. It also innovatively applies the pre-trained Transformer models under the stock pricing and factor investment context. They are compared with standard Transformer models and encoder-only Transformer models in three periods covering the entire COVID-19 pandemic to examine the model adaptivity and suitability during the extreme market fluctuations. Namely, pre-COVID-19 period (mild up-trend), COVID-19 period (sharp up-trend with deep down shock) and 1-year post-COVID-19 (high fluctuation sideways movement). The best proposed SERT model achieves the highest out-of-sample R2, 11.2% and 10.91% respectively, when extreme market fluctuation takes place followed by pre-trained Transformer models (10.38% and 9.15%). Their Trend-following-based strategy wise performance also proves their excellent capability for hedging downside risks during market shocks. The proposed SERT model achieves a Sortino ratio 47% higher than the buy-and-hold benchmark in the equal-weighted portfolio and 28% higher in the value-weighted portfolio when the pandemic period is attended. It proves that Transformer models have a great capability to capture patterns of temporal sparsity data in the asset pricing factor model, especially with considerable volatilities. We also find the softmax signal filter as the common configuration of Transformer models in alternative contexts, which only eliminates differences between models, but does not improve strategy-wise performance, while increasing attention heads improve the model performance insignificantly and applying the 'layer norm first' method do not boost the model performance in our case.</description>

      <title>Systemic Risk in the European Insurance Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interdependencies between the European insurance sector and key financial markets-equity, bond, and banking-by extending the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition framework to a broad set of performance and risk indicators. Our empirical analysis, based on a comprehensive dataset spanning January 2000 to October 2024, shows that the insurance market is not a passive receiver of external shocks but an active contributor in the propagation of systemic risk, particularly during periods of financial stress such as the subprime crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant heterogeneity is observed across subsectors, with diversified multiline insurers and reinsurance playing key roles in shock transmission. Moreover, our granular company-level analysis reveals clusters of systemically central insurance companies, underscoring the presence of a core group that consistently exhibits high interconnectivity and influence in risk propagation.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Models in Asset Pricing: An Empirical Study on Large-Cap US Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, MLP models with dynamic structure are applied to factor models for asset pricing tasks. Concretely, the MLP pyramid model structure was employed on firm-characteristic-sorted portfolio factors for modelling the large-capital US stocks. It was further developed as a practicable factor investing strategy based on the predictions. The main findings in this chapter were evaluated from two angles: model performance and investing performance, which were compared from the periods with and without COVID-19. The empirical results indicated that with the restrictions of the data size, the MLP models no longer perform "deeper, better", while the proposed MLP models with two and three hidden layers have higher flexibility to model the factors in this case. This study also verified the idea of previous works that MLP models for factor investing have more meaning in the downside risk control than in pursuing the absolute annual returns.</description>
