      <title>Exploring Feature-based Knowledge Distillation For Recommender System: A Frequency Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the feature-based knowledge distillation for recommendation from the frequency perspective. By defining knowledge as different frequency components of the features, we theoretically demonstrate that regular feature-based knowledge distillation is equivalent to equally minimizing losses on all knowledge and further analyze how this equal loss weight allocation method leads to important knowledge being overlooked. In light of this, we propose to emphasize important knowledge by redistributing knowledge weights. Furthermore, we propose FreqD, a lightweight knowledge reweighting method, to avoid the computational cost of calculating losses on each knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods for recommender systems.

      <title>ForPKG-1.0: A Framework for Constructing Forestry Policy Knowledge Graph and Application Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A policy knowledge graph can provide decision support for tasks such as project compliance, policy analysis, and intelligent question answering, and can also serve as an external knowledge base to assist the reasoning process of related large language models. Although there have been many related works on knowledge graphs, there is currently a lack of research on the construction methods of policy knowledge graphs. This paper, focusing on the forestry field, designs a complete policy knowledge graph construction framework, including: firstly, proposing a fine-grained forestry policy domain ontology; then, proposing an unsupervised policy information extraction method, and finally, constructing a complete forestry policy knowledge graph. The experimental results show that the proposed ontology has good expressiveness and extensibility, and the policy information extraction method proposed in this paper achieves better results than other unsupervised methods. Furthermore, by analyzing the application of the knowledge graph in the retrieval-augmented-generation task of the large language models, the practical application value of the knowledge graph in the era of large language models is confirmed. The knowledge graph resource will be released on an open-source platform and can serve as the basic knowledge base for forestry policy-related intelligent systems. It can also be used for academic research. In addition, this study can provide reference and guidance for the construction of policy knowledge graphs in other fields.</description>

      <title>Online Item Cold-Start Recommendation with Popularity-Aware Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of e-commerce and short videos, online recommender systems that can capture users' interests and update new items in real-time play an increasingly important role. In both online and offline recommendation, the cold-start problem due to interaction sparsity has been affecting the recommendation effect of cold-start items, which is also known as the long-tail problem of item distribution. Many cold-start scheme based on fine-tuning or knowledge transferring shows excellent performance on offline recommendation. Yet, these schemes are infeasible for online recommendation on streaming data pipelines due to different training method, computational overhead and time constraints.
  Inspired by the above questions, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation algorithm called Popularity-Aware Meta-learning (PAM), to address the item cold-start problem under streaming data settings. PAM divides the incoming data into different meta-learning tasks by predefined item popularity thresholds. The model can distinguish and reweight behavior-related features and content-related features in each task based on their different roles in different popularity levels, thus adapting to recommendations for cold-start samples. These task-fixing design significantly reduces additional computation and storage costs compared to offline methods. Furthermore, PAM also introduced data augmentation and an additional self-supervised loss specifically designed for low-popularity tasks, leveraging insights from high-popularity samples. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of inadequate supervision due to the scarcity of cold-start samples. Experimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods in addressing cold-start challenges in online streaming data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controlling Diversity at Inference: Guiding Diffusion Recommender Models with Targeted Category Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity control is an important task to alleviate bias amplification and filter bubble problems. The desired degree of diversity may fluctuate based on users' daily moods or business strategies. However, existing methods for controlling diversity often lack flexibility, as diversity is decided during training and cannot be easily modified during inference. We propose \textbf{D3Rec} (\underline{D}isentangled \underline{D}iffusion model for \underline{D}iversified \underline{Rec}ommendation), an end-to-end method that controls the accuracy-diversity trade-off at inference. D3Rec meets our three desiderata by (1) generating recommendations based on category preferences, (2) controlling category preferences during the inference phase, and (3) adapting to arbitrary targeted category preferences. In the forward process, D3Rec removes category preferences lurking in user interactions by adding noises. Then, in the reverse process, D3Rec generates recommendations through denoising steps while reflecting desired category preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of D3Rec in controlling diversity at inference.</description>

      <title>All-domain Moveline Evolution Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce app users exhibit behaviors that are inherently logically consistent. A series of multi-scenario user behaviors interconnect to form the scene-level all-domain user moveline, which ultimately reveals the user's true intention. Traditional CTR prediction methods typically focus on the item-level interaction between the target item and the historically interacted items. However, the scene-level interaction between the target item and the user moveline remains underexplored. There are two challenges when modeling the interaction with preceding all-domain user moveline: (i) Heterogeneity between items and scenes: Unlike traditional user behavior sequences that utilize items as carriers, the user moveline utilizes scenes as carriers. The heterogeneity between items and scenes complicates the process of aligning interactions within a unified representation space. (ii) Temporal misalignment of linked scene-level and item-level behaviors: In the preceding user moveline with a fixed sampling length, certain critical scene-level behaviors are closely linked to subsequent item-level behaviors. However, it is impossible to establish a complete temporal alignment that clearly identifies which specific scene-level behaviors correspond to which item-level behaviors. To address these challenges and pioneer modeling user intent from the perspective of the all-domain moveline, we propose All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN). AMEN not only transfers interactions between items and scenes to homogeneous representation spaces, but also introduces a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to understand the nuanced associations between scene-level and item-level behaviors, ensuring that the all-domain user moveline differentially influences CTR predictions for user's favored and unfavored items. Online A/B testing demonstrates that our method achieves a +11.6% increase in CTCVR.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Contrastive Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms provide entrances for customers to enter mini-apps to meet their specific shopping needs. At the entrance of a mini-app, a trigger item recommended based on customers' historical preferences, is displayed to attract customers to enter the mini-app. Existing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction approaches have two significant weaknesses: (i) A portion of customer entries is driven by their interest in the mini-app itself rather than the trigger item. In such cases, approaches highly hinging on the trigger item tend to recommend similar items, thus misunderstanding the customers' real intention; (ii) Approaches that consider customers' intention toward mini-apps, require the regular existence of mini-apps for customers to cultivate routine shopping habits, making such approaches less robust for mini-apps that are available for only short periods (1 or 3 days) in Explosive Promotional Scenarios (EPS), such as the Black Friday and China's Double 11 Shopping Carnival. To address the above-mentioned issues, we introduce a more general and robust CTR prediction approach, dubbed Collaborative Contrastive Network (CCN). Given a user, CCN learns to identify two item clusters that can represent the user's interests and disinterests, via leveraging the collaborative relationship of co-click/co-non-click or the non-collaborative relationship of mono-click as the supervision signal for contrastive learning. This paradigm does not need to explicitly estimate user's binary entry intention and avoids amplifying the impact of the trigger item. Online A/B testing on large-scale real-world data demonstrates that CCN sets a new state-of-the-art performance on Taobao, boosting CTR by 12.3% and order volume by 12.7%.</description>

      <title>QARM: Quantitative Alignment Multi-Modal Recommendation at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.</description>

      <title>Drowning in Documents: Consequences of Scaling Reranker Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rerankers, typically cross-encoders, are often used to re-score the documents retrieved by cheaper initial IR systems. This is because, though expensive, rerankers are assumed to be more effective. We challenge this assumption by measuring reranker performance for full retrieval, not just re-scoring first-stage retrieval. Our experiments reveal a surprising trend: the best existing rerankers provide diminishing returns when scoring progressively more documents and actually degrade quality beyond a certain limit. In fact, in this setting, rerankers can frequently assign high scores to documents with no lexical or semantic overlap with the query. We hope that our findings will spur future research to improve reranking.</description>

      <title>Any2Any: Incomplete Multimodal Retrieval with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents perceive and interpret their surroundings by integrating multimodal inputs, such as vision, audio, and LiDAR. These perceptual modalities support retrieval tasks, such as place recognition in robotics. However, current multimodal retrieval systems encounter difficulties when parts of the data are missing due to sensor failures or inaccessibility, such as silent videos or LiDAR scans lacking RGB information. We propose Any2Any-a novel retrieval framework that addresses scenarios where both query and reference instances have incomplete modalities. Unlike previous methods limited to the imputation of two modalities, Any2Any handles any number of modalities without training generative models. It calculates pairwise similarities with cross-modal encoders and employs a two-stage calibration process with conformal prediction to align the similarities. Any2Any enables effective retrieval across multimodal datasets, e.g., text-LiDAR and text-time series. It achieves a Recall@5 of 35% on the KITTI dataset, which is on par with baseline models with complete modalities.</description>

      <title>Empowering Meta-Analysis: Leveraging Large Language Models for Scientific Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the automation of meta-analysis in scientific documents using large language models (LLMs). Meta-analysis is a robust statistical method that synthesizes the findings of multiple studies support articles to provide a comprehensive understanding. We know that a meta-article provides a structured analysis of several articles. However, conducting meta-analysis by hand is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to human error, highlighting the need for automated pipelines to streamline the process. Our research introduces a novel approach that fine-tunes the LLM on extensive scientific datasets to address challenges in big data handling and structured data extraction. We automate and optimize the meta-analysis process by integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Tailored through prompt engineering and a new loss metric, Inverse Cosine Distance (ICD), designed for fine-tuning on large contextual datasets, LLMs efficiently generate structured meta-analysis content. Human evaluation then assesses relevance and provides information on model performance in key metrics. This research demonstrates that fine-tuned models outperform non-fine-tuned models, with fine-tuned LLMs generating 87.6% relevant meta-analysis abstracts. The relevance of the context, based on human evaluation, shows a reduction in irrelevancy from 4.56% to 1.9%. These experiments were conducted in a low-resource environment, highlighting the study's contribution to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of meta-analysis automation.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Model Extraction Attacks against Sequential Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among adversarial attacks against sequential recommender systems, model extraction attacks represent a method to attack sequential recommendation models without prior knowledge. Existing research has primarily concentrated on the adversary's execution of black-box attacks through data-free model extraction. However, a significant gap remains in the literature concerning the development of surrogate models by adversaries with access to few-shot raw data (10\% even less). That is, the challenge of how to construct a surrogate model with high functional similarity within the context of few-shot data scenarios remains an issue that requires resolution.This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel few-shot model extraction framework against sequential recommenders, which is designed to construct a superior surrogate model with the utilization of few-shot data. The proposed few-shot model extraction framework is comprised of two components: an autoregressive augmentation generation strategy and a bidirectional repair loss-facilitated model distillation procedure. Specifically, to generate synthetic data that closely approximate the distribution of raw data, autoregressive augmentation generation strategy integrates a probabilistic interaction sampler to extract inherent dependencies and a synthesis determinant signal module to characterize user behavioral patterns. Subsequently, bidirectional repair loss, which target the discrepancies between the recommendation lists, is designed as auxiliary loss to rectify erroneous predictions from surrogate models, transferring knowledge from the victim model to the surrogate model effectively. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed few-shot model extraction framework yields superior surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Do Captioning Metrics Reflect Music Semantic Alignment?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music captioning has emerged as a promising task, fueled by the advent of advanced language generation models. However, the evaluation of music captioning relies heavily on traditional metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE which were developed for other domains, without proper justification for their use in this new field. We present cases where traditional metrics are vulnerable to syntactic changes, and show they do not correlate well with human judgments. By addressing these issues, we aim to emphasize the need for a critical reevaluation of how music captions are assessed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.00223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory Based Collaborative Filtering is a widely used approach to provide recommendations. It exploits similarities between ratings across a population of users by forming a weighted vote to predict unobserved ratings. Bespoke solutions are frequently adopted to deal with the problem of high quality recommendations on large data sets. A disadvantage of this approach, however, is the loss of generality and flexibility of the general collaborative filtering systems. In this paper, we have developed a methodology that allows one to build a scalable and effective collaborative filtering system on top of a conventional full-text search engine such as Apache Lucene.</description>

      <title>Understanding Before Recommendation: Semantic Aspect-Aware Review Exploitation via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems harness user-item interactions like clicks and reviews to learn their representations. Previous studies improve recommendation accuracy and interpretability by modeling user preferences across various aspects and intents. However, the aspects and intents are inferred directly from user reviews or behavior patterns, suffering from the data noise and the data sparsity problem. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the reasons behind recommendations due to the challenges of interpreting implicit aspects and intents. Inspired by the deep semantic understanding offered by large language models (LLMs), we introduce a chain-based prompting approach to uncover semantic aspect-aware interactions, which provide clearer insights into user behaviors at a fine-grained semantic level. To incorporate the abundant interactions of various aspects, we propose the simple yet effective Semantic Aspect-based Graph Convolution Network (short for SAGCN). By performing graph convolutions on multiple semantic aspect graphs, SAGCN efficiently combines embeddings across multiple semantic aspects for final user and item representations. The effectiveness of the SAGCN was evaluated on three publicly available datasets through extensive experiments, which revealed that it outperforms all other competitors. Furthermore, interpretability analysis experiments were conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of incorporating semantic aspects into the model.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Building Long-Context Retrieval Models with LoCo and M2-BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval pipelines-an integral component of many machine learning systems-perform poorly in domains where documents are long (e.g., 10K tokens or more) and where identifying the relevant document requires synthesizing information across the entire text. Developing long-context retrieval encoders suitable for these domains raises three challenges: (1) how to evaluate long-context retrieval performance, (2) how to pretrain a base language model to represent both short contexts (corresponding to queries) and long contexts (corresponding to documents), and (3) how to fine-tune this model for retrieval under the batch size limitations imposed by GPU memory constraints. To address these challenges, we first introduce LoCoV1, a novel 12 task benchmark constructed to measure long-context retrieval where chunking is not possible or not effective. We next present the M2-BERT retrieval encoder, an 80M parameter state-space encoder model built from the Monarch Mixer architecture, capable of scaling to documents up to 32K tokens long. We describe a pretraining data mixture which allows this encoder to process both short and long context sequences, and a finetuning approach that adapts this base model to retrieval with only single-sample batches. Finally, we validate the M2-BERT retrieval encoder on LoCoV1, finding that it outperforms competitive Transformer-based models by at least 23.3 points, despite containing upwards of 90x fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the `Why' of Buying: Introducing a New Dataset and Benchmark for Purchase Reason and Post-Purchase Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In business and marketing, analyzing the reasons behind buying is a fundamental step towards understanding consumer behaviors, shaping business strategies, and predicting market outcomes. Prior research on purchase reason has relied on surveys to gather data from users. However, this method is limited in scalability, often focusing on specific products or brands, and may not accurately represent the broader population due to the restricted number of participants involved.
  In our work, we propose purchase reason prediction as a novel task for modern AI models. To benchmark potential AI solutions for this new task, we first generate a dataset that consists of real-world explanations of why users make certain purchase decisions for various products. Our approach induces LLMs to explicitly distinguish between the reasons behind purchasing a product and the experience after the purchase in a user review. An automated, LLM-driven evaluation as well as a small scale human evaluation confirm the effectiveness of this approach to obtaining high-quality, personalized purchase reasons and post-purchase experiences. With this novel dataset, we are able to benchmark the purchase reason prediction task using various LLMs. Moreover, we demonstrate how purchase reasons can be valuable for downstream applications, such as marketing-focused user behavior analysis, post-purchase experience and rating prediction in recommender systems, and serving as a new approach to justify recommendations.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models for Product Bundling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in product bundling have leveraged multimodal information through sophisticated encoders, but remain constrained by limited semantic understanding and a narrow scope of knowledge. Therefore, some attempts employ In-context Learning (ICL) to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for their extensive knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. However, these efforts are inadequate in understanding mulitmodal data and exploiting LLMs' knowledge for product bundling. To bridge the gap, we introduce Bundle-MLLM, a novel framework that fine-tunes LLMs through a hybrid item tokenization approach within a well-designed optimization strategy. Specifically, we integrate textual, media, and relational data into a unified tokenization, introducing a soft separation token to distinguish between textual and non-textual tokens. Additionally, a streamlined yet powerful multimodal fusion module is employed to embed all non-textual features into a single, informative token, significantly boosting efficiency. To tailor product bundling tasks for LLMs, we reformulate the task as a multiple-choice question with candidate items as options. We further propose a progressive optimization strategy that fine-tunes LLMs for disentangled objectives: 1) learning bundle patterns and 2) enhancing multimodal semantic understanding specific to product bundling. Extensive experiments on four datasets across two domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>GradCraft: Elevating Multi-task Recommendations through Holistic Gradient Crafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems require the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives to accurately model user interests, necessitating the application of multi-task learning methods. However, existing multi-task learning methods in recommendations overlook the specific characteristics of recommendation scenarios, falling short in achieving proper gradient balance. To address this challenge, we set the target of multi-task learning as attaining the appropriate magnitude balance and the global direction balance, and propose an innovative methodology named GradCraft in response. GradCraft dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes to align with the maximum gradient norm, mitigating interference from gradient magnitudes for subsequent manipulation. It then employs projections to eliminate gradient conflicts in directions while considering all conflicting tasks simultaneously, theoretically guaranteeing the global resolution of direction conflicts. GradCraft ensures the concurrent achievement of appropriate magnitude balance and global direction balance, aligning with the inherent characteristics of recommendation scenarios. Both offline and online experiments attest to the efficacy of GradCraft in enhancing multi-task performance in recommendations. The source code for GradCraft can be accessed at https://github.com/baiyimeng/GradCraft.</description>

      <title>Enhancing High-order Interaction Awareness in LLM-based Recommender Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated prominent reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks by transforming them into text-generation tasks. However, existing approaches either disregard or ineffectively model the user-item high-order interactions. To this end, this paper presents an enhanced LLM-based recommender (ELMRec). We enhance whole-word embeddings to substantially enhance LLMs' interpretation of graph-constructed interactions for recommendations, without requiring graph pre-training. This finding may inspire endeavors to incorporate rich knowledge graphs into LLM-based recommenders via whole-word embedding. We also found that LLMs often recommend items based on users' earlier interactions rather than recent ones, and present a reranking solution. Our ELMRec outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both direct and sequential recommendations.</description>

      <title>Harnessing High-Level Song Descriptors towards Natural Language-Based Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems relying on Language Models (LMs) have gained popularity in assisting users to navigate large catalogs. LMs often exploit item high-level descriptors, i.e. categories or consumption contexts, from training data or user preferences. This has been proven effective in domains like movies or products. However, in the music domain, understanding how effectively LMs utilize song descriptors for natural language-based music recommendation is relatively limited. In this paper, we assess LMs effectiveness in recommending songs based on user natural language descriptions and items with descriptors like genres, moods, and listening contexts. We formulate the recommendation task as a dense retrieval problem and assess LMs as they become increasingly familiar with data pertinent to the task and domain. Our findings reveal improved performance as LMs are fine-tuned for general language similarity, information retrieval, and mapping longer descriptions to shorter, high-level descriptors in music.</description>

      <title>Invar-RAG: Invariant LLM-aligned Retrieval for Better Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capability in providing reliable answer predictions and addressing hallucination problems. A typical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external information and large language models (LLMs) to generate answers. In contrast, recent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial improvements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic understanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems presents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive parametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across the corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries instead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs introduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning architecture called Invar-RAG. In the retrieval stage, an LLM-based retriever is constructed by integrating LoRA-based representation learning to tackle feature locality issues. To enhance retrieval performance, we develop two patterns (invariant and variant patterns) and an invariance loss to reduce LLM variance. In the generation stage, a refined fine-tuning method is employed to improve LLM accuracy in generating answers based on retrieved information. Experimental results show that Invar-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines across three open-domain question answering (ODQA) datasets. Code is available in the Supplementary Material for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>SupplyGraph: A Benchmark Dataset for Supply Chain Planning using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

      <title>A Framework for Leveraging Partially-Labeled Data for Product Attribute-Value Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the e-commerce domain, the accurate extraction of attribute-value pairs (e.g., Brand: Apple) from product titles and user search queries is crucial for enhancing search and recommendation systems. A major challenge with neural models for this task is the lack of high-quality training data, as the annotations for attribute-value pairs in the available datasets are often incomplete. To address this, we introduce GenToC, a model designed for training directly with partially-labeled data, eliminating the necessity for a fully annotated dataset. GenToC employs a marker-augmented generative model to identify potential attributes, followed by a token classification model that determines the associated values for each attribute. GenToC outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, exhibiting upto 56.3% increase in the number of accurate extractions. Furthermore, we utilize GenToC to regenerate the training dataset to expand attribute-value annotations. This bootstrapping substantially improves the data quality for training other standard NER models, which are typically faster but less capable in handling partially-labeled data, enabling them to achieve comparable performance to GenToC. Our results demonstrate GenToC's unique ability to learn from a limited set of partially-labeled data and improve the training of more efficient models, advancing the automated extraction of attribute-value pairs. Finally, our model has been successfully integrated into IndiaMART, India's largest B2B e-commerce platform, achieving a significant increase of 20.2% in the number of correctly identified attribute-value pairs over the existing deployed system while achieving a high precision of 89.5%.</description>

      <title>ptt5-v2: A Closer Look at Continued Pretraining of T5 Models for the Portuguese Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the growing availability of pretrained models, the English language remains the primary focus of model development. Continued pretraining on language-specific corpora provides a practical solution for adapting models to other languages. However, the impact of different pretraining settings on downstream tasks remains underexplored. This work introduces $\texttt{ptt5-v2}$, investigating the continued pretraining of T5 models for Portuguese. We first develop a baseline set of settings and pretrain models with sizes up to 3B parameters. Finetuning on three Portuguese downstream tasks (assin2 STS, assin2 RTE, and TweetSentBR) yields SOTA results on the latter two. We then explore the effects of different pretraining configurations, including pretraining data quality, optimization strategies, and multi-epoch pretraining. Perhaps surprisingly, their impact remains subtle compared to our baseline. We release $\texttt{ptt5-v2}$ pretrained checkpoints and their MonoT5-based finetuned $\texttt{MonoPTT5}$ rerankers on HuggingFace in their respective collections at \url{https://huggingface.co/unicamp-dl}.</description>
