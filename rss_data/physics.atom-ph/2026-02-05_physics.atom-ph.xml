      <title>Radiation of relativistic electrons created in tunnel ionization of atomic gases by laser beams of extreme intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tunnel ionization of atomic argon in a femtosecond laser pulse of intensity $10^{21}-10^{22}{\rm W/cm}^2$ aiming to investigate the relativistic dynamics and radiation of photoelectrons released from their parent ions inside the laser focus. Radiation of such electrons accelerated along the laser field propagation direction appears to have moderate power but can be considerably enhanced by a collision with a relatively weak counter-propagating laser pulse. Using the theory of laser-induced tunneling in atoms and ions and that of nonlinear Thomson scattering, we demonstrate that angular distributions and spectra of emitted photons can serve as a probe of the peak intensity in the focus. The angular distribution of emitted radiation in the plane of polarization and propagation of the ionizing laser beam appears narrow and peaked around an intensity-dependent angle, making this ionization setup a source of collimated XUV radiation.</description>

      <title>A comparison of Fraunhofer-type diffraction from an atomic single-slit and a molecular double-slit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measured the Q-value and the scattering angle distributions for non-dissociative state selective single electron capture in collisions of 7.5 keV H$^+$ and 15 keV H$_2^+$ with He. The experimental data are compared with semiclassical close-coupling calculations and predictions from the classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations. By analogy with Fraunhofer diffraction, we also developed a toy model to reconstruct an imaginary screen that reflects the reaction impact-parameter dependence, in channels where the magnetic quantum number remains unchanged. It is well established that H$_2^+$ acts as a molecular double-slit in scattering processes. By demodulating the Young's double-slit-type interference pattern, we extracted the individual slit diffraction pattern of H$_2^+$ and compared it with that of the H$^+$ atomic single-slit. For ground state electron capture, we found that the single and the double slit diffraction patterns have equal fringe width, whereas for excited state electron capture, diffraction patterns are quite different.</description>
