      <title>Universality of discontinuous bifurcations in collisionless dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universality in collisionless nonlinear dynamics of a codimension-two bifurcation where two eigenvalues collide at the origin, and two lines of continuous bifurcation and discontinuous jump meet. Through linear analysis and direct numerical simulations, we show that this bifurcation does occur, both for two-dimensional shear flows and for repulsive systems mimicking plasmas.</description>

      <title>New envelope equations for shallow water waves and modulational instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of wave groups is studied for long waves, using the framework of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation and its generalizations. It is shown that the dynamics are richer than the corresponding results obtained just from the Korteweg-de Vries-type equation. First, a reduction to a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is obtained for weakly nonlinear wave packets, and it is demonstrated that either the focusing or the defocusing case can be obtained. This is in contrast to the corresponding reduction for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, where only the defocusing case is found. The focusing regime displays modulational instability responsible for the appearance of rogue waves. Next, the condition for modulational instability is obtained in the case of one and two monochromatic waves in interaction at slow space-time coordinates with equal scalings. Other new envelope equations are obtained starting from the general system describing shallow water waves found by Bona et al. [3]. A presumably integrable system is obtained form the integrable Kaup-Boussinesq one.</description>

      <title>Spatial competition and repulsion: pattern formation and the role of movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter investigates some mechanisms behind pattern formation driven by competitive-only or repelling interactions, and explores how these patterns are influenced by different types of particle movement. Despite competition and repulsion are both anti-crowding interactions, collective effects may lead to clusters of individuals, which can arrange periodically. Through the analysis of two models, it provides insights into the similarities and differences in the patterns formed and underlines the role of movement in shaping the spatial distribution of biological populations.</description>

      <title>Variational Pattern Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address pattern selection problems in nonlinear interface dynamics by maximizing the entropy of the most probable (classical) scenario associated with the processes. This variational principle we applied to well-known selection problems in a Hele-Shaw cell: stationary Saffman-Taylor finger in a channel and self-similar finger in a wedge. The obtained results excellently agree with experiments. We also address the universal fjord opening angle. This principle complements a non-variational selection developed earlier. Surface tension is not needed for selection in both approaches, contrary to the common belief.</description>

      <title>Constructing longulence in the Galerkin-regularized nonlinear Schr\"odinger and complex Ginzburg-Landau systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Quasi-)periodic solutions are constructed analytically for Galerkin-regularized or truncated nonlinear Schr\"odinger (GrNLS) systems preserving finite Fourier freedoms. GrNLS admits travelling-wave or multi-phase solutions, including monochromatic solutions independent of the truncation and quasi-periodic ones with or without additional on-torus invariants. Numerical tests show that instability leads such solutions to nontrivial longulent states with remarkable solitonic structures (called ``longons'') admist disordered weaker components, corresponding to presumably whiskered tori. In the strong-coupling limit (e.g., the self-phase modulation equation in optics), neutral stability holds for the condensates, without the modulational instability, but not generally for other multi-phase (quasi-)periodic solutions from some of which the longulent state developed is also adressed. The possibility of nontrivial Galerkin-regularized complex Ginzburg-Landau longulent states is also discussed for motivation.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of streamer discharges is determined at their heads, for individual streamers as well as in collective phenomena, such as streamer trees or coronas or streamer bursts ahead of lightning leaders. Some properties of the streamer heads, such as velocity $v$ and radius $R$ now can be measured quite well, but this is very challenging for others such as the maximal electric field, the charge content of the streamer head and the degree of chemical excitation and ionization in the streamer channel. Here we develop, test and evaluate a macroscopic approximation for positive streamer heads in air that relates macroscopic streamer head properties to each other. In particular, we find that velocity $v$, radius $R$ and background field $E_{\rm bg}$ determine the complete profile of streamer heads with photoionization, if they propagate steadily. We also review Naidis' approximate relation between $v$, $R$ and the maximal field $E_{\rm max}$. The approximate head model developed in the present paper consists of three first-order ordinary differential equations along the streamer axis. It is derived from the classical fluid model for streamer discharges by assuming axisymmetry, steady streamer propagation (i.e. with constant velocity and shape), and a spherical shape of the charge layer around the streamer head. The new reduced model agrees well with full solutions of the classical fluid model, even when it is applied to accelerating streamers. Therefore the model can be used for evaluations of experiments, like for the determination of the maximal electric field from radius and velocity of the streamer. It is also a step towards constructing reduced models for the collective dynamics of multi-streamer discharges.</description>
