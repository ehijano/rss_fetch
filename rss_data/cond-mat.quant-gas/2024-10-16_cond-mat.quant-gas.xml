      <title>Fate of thermalization of ultracold fermions with two-body dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-body dissipation due to chemical reactions occurs in both ultracold fermionic and bosonic molecular gases. Despite recent advances in achieving quantum degeneracy, the loss dynamics are typically described phenomenologically using rate equations, often assuming thermalization during chemical reactions. From the first principles, we analyze particle loss, temperature evolution, and momentum distributions in single-component Fermi gases using the inelastic quantum Boltzmann equation. Our results prove that the conventional two-body loss model is valid for trapped systems, though it fails to describe the dynamics in homogeneous systems accurately. Interestingly, we find that systems prepared near or above quantum degeneracy can thermalize spontaneously, even in the absence of elastic collisions, while systems initialized deep in degeneracy display non-equilibrium behavior. Our calculations are in good agreement with recent experimental data from trapped systems and could be further tested in atomic systems with induced two-body loss in box potentials.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous creation of skyrmions in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of a vortex ring in a miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a harmonic potential, where the vortex cores in the two components are initially overlapped. Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically, we find that the overlapped vortex rings in the two components are dynamically unstable against separation and that they can form linked vortex rings, resulting in a three-dimensional skyrmion. The parameter range for spontaneous skyrmion generation is determined by the Bogoliubov analysis</description>

      <title>Dynamical signature of vortex mass in Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are commonly described as funnel-like objects around which the superfluid swirls, and their motion is typically modeled in terms of massless particles. Here, we show that, in Fermi superfluids, the normal component confined in the vortex core provides the vortex with a finite inertial mass. This inertia imparts an unambiguous signature to the dynamic behavior of vortices, specifically manifesting as small-amplitude transverse oscillations which remarkably follow the prediction of a simple point-like model supplemented by an effective mass. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale time-dependent simulations of Fermi superfluids across a wide range of interaction parameters, at both zero and finite temperatures, and for various initial conditions. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of inertial effects in superfluid vortex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cnoidal wave supersolidity in nonequilibrium states is dynamically unstable at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible existence of an exotic phase of matter rigid like a solid but able to sustain persistent and dissipation-less flow like a superfluid, a "supersolid", has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental efforts since the discovery of superfluidity in Helium-4. Recently, it has been proposed that nonlinear periodic modulations known as cnoidal waves, that naturally emerge in Bose-Einstein condensates, provide a promising platform to find and study supersolidity in nonequilibrium phases of matter. Nevertheless, so far the analysis has been limited to a one-dimensional zero-temperature system. By combining the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a finite temperature holographic model, we show that the proposed cnoidal wave supersolid phases of matter are always energetically and dynamically unstable at finite temperature. We ascribe this instability to the dynamics of the "elastic" Goldstone mode arising as a direct consequence of translational order. Finally, we study the dynamical instability of the supersolid state and connect it to the production of topological defects during the relaxation towards a final homogeneous equilibrium state with smaller superflow current, similar to the Landau instability dynamics in superfluids. Our results suggest that the supersolidity of cnoidal waves can emerge only as a transient phenomenon and not as a truly equilibrium and stable ground state.</description>

      <title>Stop using Landau gauge for Tight-binding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal under a commensurate perpendicular magnetic field, tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians are typically constructed using a magnetic unit cell (MUC), which is composed of several unit cells (UC) to satisfy flux quantization. However, when the vector potential is constrained to the Landau gauge, an additional constraint is imposed on the hopping trajectories, further enlarging the TB Hamiltonian and preventing incommensurate atomic rearrangements. In this paper, we demonstrate that this constraint persists, albeit in a weaker form, for any linear vector potential ($\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})$ linear in $\mathbf{r}$). This restriction can only be fully lifted by using a nonlinear vector potential. With a general nonlinear vector potential, a TB Hamiltonian can be constructed that matches the minimal size dictated by flux quantization, even when incommensurate atomic rearrangements occur within the MUC, such as moir\'e reconstructions. For example, as the twist angle $\theta$ of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) approaches zero, the size of the TB Hamiltonian scales as $1/\theta^4$ when using linear vector potentials (including the Landau gauge). In contrast, with a nonlinear vector potential, the size scales more favorably, as $1/\theta^2$, making small-angle TBG models more tractable with TB.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric driven transition between superfluid and incoherent fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between repulsive interaction and superfluidity in flat band system. We consider spatially indirect excitons in the Lieb lattice bilayer as an example. We show that due to the presence of repulsive interaction, the excitons may form an incoherent fluid. By increasing the quantum metric, the exciton fluid experiences a transition into the superfluid phase. Such transition may be captured by a model of Josephson junction array, which is beyond mean field description.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and vortices in a tri-core nonlinear fractional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a waveguiding system composed of three linearly-coupled fractional waveguides, with a triangular (prismatic) transverse structure. It may be realized as a tri-core nonlinear optical fiber with fractional group-velocity dispersion (GVD), or, possibly, as a system of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations for a set of three tunnel-coupled cigar-shaped traps filled by a Bose-Einstein condensate of particles moving by L\'evy flights. The analysis is focused on the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) between components of triple solitons, and the formation and stability of vortex modes. In the self-focusing regime, we identify symmetric and asymmetric soliton states, whose structure and stability are determined by the L\'evy index of the fractional GVD, the inter-core coupling strength, and the total energy, which determines the system's nonlinearity. Bifurcation diagrams (of the supercritical type) reveal regions where SSB occurs, identifying the respective symmetric and asymmetric ground-state soliton modes. In agreement with the general principle of the SSB theory, the solitons with broken inter-component symmetry prevail with the increase of the energy in the weakly-coupled system. Three-components vortex solitons (which do not feature SSB) are studied too. Because the fractional GVD breaks the system's Galilean invariance, we also address mobility of the vortex solitons, by applying a boost to them.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical self-organization in a mesoscopic atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in modern physics is bridging the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body macroscopic systems. This gap may be bridged by tracing the properties of well-controlled intermediate-size mesoscopic systems. Here, we study mesoscopic signatures of a spatial self-organization phase transition in deterministically prepared arrays of between 10 and 22 atoms inside an optical cavity. Through precise engineering of the atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number. We identify characteristic dynamical behaviors related to symmetry breaking and system size in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. This work opens the door to probing particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Collisional Cooling of Ultracold Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the original work on Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum degenerate gases of atoms have allowed the quantum emulation of important systems from condensed matter and nuclear physics, as well as the study of novel many-body states with no analog in other fields of physics. Ultracold molecules in the micro- and nano-Kelvin regimes promise to bring powerful new capabilities to quantum emulation and quantum computing, thanks to their rich internal degrees of freedom compared to atoms. They also open new possibilities for precision measurement and the study of quantum chemistry. Quantum gases of atoms were made possible by collision-based cooling schemes, such as evaporative cooling. For ultracold molecules, thermalization and collisional cooling have not been realized. With other techniques such as supersonic jets and cryogenic buffer gases, studies have been limited to temperatures above 10 mK. Here we show cooling of NaLi molecules at micro- and nano-Kelvin temperatures through collisions with ultracold Na atoms, both prepared in their stretched hyperfine spin states. We find a lower bound on the elastic to inelastic collision ratio between molecules and atoms greater than 50 -- large enough to support sustained collisional cooling. By employing two stages of evaporation, we increase the phase-space density (PSD) of the molecules by a factor of 20, achieving temperatures as low as 220 nK. The favorable collisional properties of a Na and NaLi mixture show great promise for making deeply quantum degenerate dipolar molecules and suggest the potential for such cooling in other systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knots that Never Come Untied</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin proposed that atoms form hydrodynamic vortex knots. However, they typically untie through reconnections, i. e., local cut-and-slice events, unlike stable vortex unknots such as smoke rings. The same holds in superfluids--quantum fluids with zero viscosity--where vortices have quantized circulation, making them topologically stable. For over 150 years, hydrodynamically stable vortex knots have been sought both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we present the first demonstration of hydrodynamically stable vortex knots and links in experimentally realizable Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases and confirm it through dynamic simulations. Our method creates stable knotted vortex structures in systems where reconnections are prohibited, with potential relevance to neutron star interiors. Additionally, we anticipate our mathematical framework could have applications in quantum computation, quantum turbulence, and DNA dynamics, particularly where reconnections are restricted.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamics and Shortcuts to Adiabaticity in the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling many-body quantum systems is a highly challenging task required to advance quantum technologies. Here, we report progress in controlling gapless many-body quantum systems described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). To do so, we investigate the exact dynamics of the TLL induced by an interaction quench, making use of the $SU(1,1)$ dynamical symmetry group and the Schr\"odinger picture. First, we demonstrate that this approach is useful to perform a shortcut to adiabaticity, that cancels the final non-adiabatic residual energy of the driven TLL and is experimentally implementable in the semiclassical limit of the sine-Gordon model. Second, we apply this framework to analyze various driving schemes in finite time, including linear ramps and smooth protocols.</description>
