      <title>New Insights into Automatic Treatment Planning for Cancer Radiotherapy Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Multimodal concentric surface coils for enhanced sensitivity in MR imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the design, simulation, and experimental validation of a novel multimodal concentric surface coil for MR imaging, developed to achieve higher B1 field efficiency while maintaining low SAR for enhanced imaging performance. The coil comprises multiple electromagnetically coupled concentric resonators of varying sizes. The resonant frequency of a desired mode is tuned to 127 MHz, as an example, to demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique at 3 Tesla. Fullwave electromagnetic simulations of the proposed design and bench tests of fabricated prototypes were conducted to evaluate the coil's B1 field efficiency and distribution, multimodal resonance behavior, scattering parameters, and SAR performance. Inductive Current Elimination or magnetic wall decoupling was implemented to enhance channel isolation in a multi channel configuration to demonstrate the feasibility of applying this multimodal technique to RF array design and parallel imaging. Experimental results show that the proposed concentric coil achieves higher B1 field efficiency and reduced SAR compared to a conventional surface coil of the same size operating at 3 Tesla. Bench measurements on the prototypes confirmed successful tuning and impedance matching, with measured S11 and S21 parameters validating the effectiveness of the decoupling strategy. B1 mapping experiments further demonstrated efficient RF power delivery across multiple planes. These findings suggest that the proposed multimodal concentric coil has the potential to serve as a promising alternative to conventional surface coils for high performance MR imaging, offering enhanced RF efficiency, reduced SAR, and the ability to construct multichannel RF arrays.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Diffusion Reconstruction with Posterior Correction for Quantitative and Fast PET Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data. Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios. Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve clinical imaging workflows.</description>

      <title>Calibration offset estimation in mobile hearing tests via categorical loudness scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To enable reliable smartphone-based hearing assessments by developing methods to estimate device calibration offsets using categorical loudness scaling (CLS). Design: Calibration offsets were simulated from a Gaussian distribution. Two prediction models - a Bayesian regression model and a nearest neighbor model - were trained on CLS-derived parameters and data from the Oldenburg Hearing Health Repository (OHHR). CLS was chosen because it provides level-independent measures (e.g., dynamic range) that remain robust despite calibration errors. Study Sample: The dataset comprised CLS results from N = 847 participants with a mean age of 70.0 years (SD = 8.7), including 556 male and 291 female listeners with diverse hearing profiles. Results: The Bayesian regression model achieved correlations of up to 0.81 between estimated and true calibration offsets, enabling accurate individual-level correction. Compared to threshold-based approaches, calibration uncertainty was reduced by factors between 0.41 and 0.79, demonstrating greater robustness in uncontrolled environments. Conclusions: CLS-based models can effectively compensate for missing calibration in mobile hearing assessments. This approach provides a practical alternative to threshold-based methods, supporting the use of smartphone-based tests outside laboratory settings and expanding access to reliable hearing healthcare in everyday and resource-limited contexts.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Imaged Bio-morphological Features Verify Patient Positioning with Deformable Tissue Translocation in Breast Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate patient positioning is critical for precise radiotherapy dose delivery, as positioning errors can significantly affect treatment outcomes. This study introduces a novel method for tracking loco-regional tissue deformation through Cherenkov image analysis during fractionated breast cancer radiotherapy. The primary goal was to develop and test an algorithm for Cherenkov-based regional position accuracy quantification, specifically for loco-regional deformations, which lack ideal quantification methods in radiotherapy. Blood vessel detection and segmentation were developed in Cherenkov images using a tissue phantom with incremental movements, and later applied to images from fractionated whole breast radiotherapy in human patients (n=10). A combined rigid and non-rigid registration technique was used to detect inter- and intra-fractional positioning variations. This approach quantified positioning variations in two parts: a global shift from rigid registration and a two-dimensional variation map of loco-regional deformation from non-rigid registration. The methodology was validated using an anthropomorphic chest phantom experiment, where known treatment couch translations and respiratory motion were simulated to assess inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, yielding an average accuracy of 0.83 mm for couch translations up to 20 mm. Analysis of clinical Cherenkov data from ten breast cancer patients showed an inter-fraction setup variation of 3.7 plus minus 2.4 mm relative to the first fraction and loco-regional deformations (95th percentile) of up to 3.3 plus minus 1.9 mm. This study presents a Cherenkov-based approach to quantify global and local positioning variations, demonstrating feasibility in addressing loco-regional deformations that conventional imaging techniques fail to capture.</description>

      <title>Species-Dependent Electron Emission from Nanoparticles under Gamma Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, various nanoparticle species-including Au and Gd$_2$O$_3$-were irradiated with low-energy gamma rays, such as 59.5 keV photons from $^{241}$Am. Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation counting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the scintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the interaction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons; however, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron emission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, "detectable electron emission" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the liquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, &gt;= 1-2 keV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies. Thus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed. Rigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including detector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and self-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from AuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common assumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit electrons upon gamma-irradiation. Instead, our results suggest that the distinct internal environment of nanoparticles influences their interaction with radiation. These findings offer significant insights for practical applications, including a better mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle radiosensitization in cancer therapy, enhanced gamma-detection efficiency of organic scintillators, and the development of lightweight radiation shields.</description>
