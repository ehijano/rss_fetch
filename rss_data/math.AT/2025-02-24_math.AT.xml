      <title>The connective KO theory of the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute ko_*(K(Z/2,2)) and ko^*(K(Z/2,2)), the connective KO-homology and -cohomology of the mod 2 Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2,2), using the Adams spectral sequence. The work relies heavily on work done several years earlier for the (complex) ku groups by the author and W.S.Wilson. We illustrate an interesting duality relation between the ko-homology and -cohomology groups. We deduce a new result about Stiefel-Whitney classes in Spin manifolds.</description>

      <title>Loop spaces of $n$-dimensional Poincar\'e duality complexes whose $(n-1)$-skeleton is a co-$H$-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under certain hypotheses, we prove a loop space decomposition for simply-connected Poincar\'e Duality complexes of dimension $n$ whose $(n-1)$-skeleton is a co-$H$-space. This unifies many known decompositions obtained in different contexts and establishes many new families of examples. As consequences, we show that such a looped Poincar\'{e} Duality complex retracts off the loops of its $(n-1)$-skeleton and describe its homology as a one-relator algebra.</description>

      <title>Sheaf theory: from deep geometry to deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the applications of sheaf theory in deep learning, data science, and computer science in general. The primary text of this work serves as a friendly introduction to applied and computational sheaf theory accessible to those with modest mathematical familiarity. We describe intuitions and motivations underlying sheaf theory shared by both theoretical researchers and practitioners, bridging classical mathematical theory and its more recent implementations within signal processing and deep learning. We observe that most notions commonly considered specific to cellular sheaves translate to sheaves on arbitrary posets, providing an interesting avenue for further generalization of these methods in applications, and we present a new algorithm to compute sheaf cohomology on arbitrary finite posets in response. By integrating classical theory with recent applications, this work reveals certain blind spots in current machine learning practices. We conclude with a list of problems related to sheaf-theoretic applications that we find mathematically insightful and practically instructive to solve. To ensure the exposition of sheaf theory is self-contained, a rigorous mathematical introduction is provided in appendices which moves from an introduction of diagrams and sheaves to the definition of derived functors, higher order cohomology, sheaf Laplacians, sheaf diffusion, and interconnections of these subjects therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.08842v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct certain unstable higher-order homotopy operations indexed by the simplex categories of $\Delta^{n}$ for ${n\geq 2}$ and prove that all elements in the homotopy groups of a wedge of spheres are generated under such operations by Whitehead products and the group structure. This provides a stronger unstable analogue of Cohen's theorem on the decomposition of stable homotopy.</description>

      <title>The sequential topological complexity of the ordered configuration space of disks in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How hard is it to program $n$ robots to move about a long narrow aisle while making a series of $r-2$ intermediate stops, provided only $w$ of the robots can fit across the width of the aisle? In this paper, we answer this question by calculating the $r^{\text{th}}$-sequential topological complexity of $\text{conf}(n,w)$, the ordered configuration space of $n$ open unit-diameter disks in the infinite strip of width $w$. We prove that as long as $n$ is greater than $w$, the $r^{\text{th}}$-sequential topological complexity of $\text{conf}(n,w)$ is $r\big(n-\big\lceil\frac{n}{w}\big\rceil\big)$. This shows that any non-looping program moving the $n$ robots between arbitrary initial and final configurations, with $r-2$ intermediate stops, must consider at least $r\big(n-\big\lceil\frac{n}{w}\big\rceil\big)$ cases.</description>

      <title>Inferring traits of hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, ideally defined for infinitely extended systems, several disordered correlated systems have finite size. It has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point patterns as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity of periodic point patterns with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structures allows for characterizing whether finite size arrangements are analogous to those realized in hyperuniform patterns. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.</description>

      <title>Isotropic motivic fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study relative versions of the category of modules over the isotropic motivic Brown-Peterson spectrum, with a particular emphasis on their cellular subcategories. Using techniques developed by Levine, we equip these categories with motivic $t$-structures, whose hearts are Tannakian categories over ${\mathbb F}_2$. This allows to define isotropic motivic fundamental groups, and to interpret relative isotropic Tate motives in the heart as their representations. Moreover, we compute these groups in the cases of the punctured projective line and split tori. Finally, we also apply Spitzweck's derived approach to establish an identification between relative isotropic Tate motives and representations of certain affine derived group schemes, whose 0-truncations coincide with the aforementioned isotropic motivic fundamental groups.</description>
