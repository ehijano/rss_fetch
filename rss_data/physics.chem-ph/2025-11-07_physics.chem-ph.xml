      <title>N-Mode Quantized Anharmonic Vibronic Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions of photochemical processes are essential for interpreting and understanding spectral features. Reliable quantum dynamics calculations of vibronic systems require precise modeling of anharmonic effects in the potential energy surfaces and off-diagonal nonadiabatic coupling terms. In this work, we present the n-mode quantization of all vibronic Hamiltonian terms comprised of general high-dimensional model representations. This results in a second-quantized framework for accurate vibronic calculations employing the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this approach by calculating the excited state quantum dynamics of maleimide. We analyze convergence and the choice of parameters of the underlying time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm for the n-mode vibronic Hamiltonian, demonstrating that it enables accurate calculations of complex photochemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electron transfer in confined electromagnetic fields: a unified Fermi's golden rule rate theory and extension to lossy cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of nanophotonics and cavity quantum electrodynamics, there has been growing interest in how confined electromagnetic fields modify fundamental molecular processes such as electron transfer. In this paper, we revisit the problem of nonadiabatic electron transfer (ET) in confined electromagnetic fields studied in [J. Chem. Phys. 150, 174122 (2019)] and present a unified rate theory based on Fermi's golden rule (FGR). By employing a polaron-transformed Hamiltonian, we derive analytic expressions for the ET rate correlation functions that are valid across all temperature regimes and all cavity mode time scales. In the high-temperature limit, our formalism recovers the Marcus and Marcus-Jortner results, while in the low-temperature limit it reveals the emergence of the energy gap law. We further extend the theory to include cavity loss by using an effective Brownian oscillator spectral density, which enables closed-form expressions for the ET rate in lossy cavities. As applications, we demonstrate two key cavity-induced phenomena: (i) resonance effects, where the ET rate is strongly enhanced at certain cavity mode frequencies, and (ii) electron-transfer-induced photon emission, arising from the population of cavity photon Fock states during the ET process. These results establish a general framework for understanding how confined electromagnetic fields reshape charge transfer dynamics, and suggest novel opportunities for controlling and probing ET reactions in nanophotonic environments.</description>

      <title>5- and 6-membered rings: A natural orbital functional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) provides a straightforward approach to capture most electron correlation effects without needing perturbative corrections or limited active spaces selection. In this work, we evaluate both the original GNOF and its modified variant GNOFm on a set of twelve 5- and 6-membered molecular rings, systems characterized primarily by dynamic correlation. This reference set is vital as it comprises essential substructures of more complex molecules. We report complete-basis-set limit correlation energies for GNOF, GNOFm, and the benchmark CCSD(T) method. Across the Dunning basis sets, both functionals deliver a balanced and accurate description of the molecular set, with GNOFm showing small but systematic improvements while preserving the overall robustness of the original formulation. These results confirm the reliability of the GNOF family and its ability to capture dynamic correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal van der Waals density functional made faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplification of the VV10 van der Waals density functional [J. Chem. Phys. 133, 244103 (2010)] is made by an approximation of the integrand of the six-dimentional integral in terms of a few products of three-dimensional density-like distributions and potential-like functions of the interelectronic distance only, opening the way for its straightforward computation by fast multipole methods. An even faster computational scheme for molecular systems is implemented where the density-like distributions are fitted by linear combinations of usual atom-centered basis functions of Gaussian type and the six-dimensional integral is then computed analytically, at a fraction of the overall cost of a typical calculation. The simplicity of the new approximation is commensurate with that of the original VV10 functional, and the same level of accuracy is seen in tests on molecules.</description>

Abstract: The precise identification of neurotransmitters is essential for comprehending cerebral function, detecting neurological conditions, and formulating successful therapeutic approaches. The present work investigates the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with $H{\beta}cd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with $H{\beta}cd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd$ with the layered sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $\mu$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $\mu$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $\mu$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $\mu$A ${\mu}M^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone, melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor. Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR.</description>

      <title>Preferred Basis in Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the adiabatic regime, our understanding of quantum dynamics in coupled systems remains limited, and the choice of representation continues to obscure physical interpretation and simulation accuracy. Here we propose a natural and efficient basis for electron nuclear dynamics by drawing on the concepts of pointer and preferred states from decoherence theory, adapted to systems where electrons and nuclei interact strongly. Within this framework, we show that 1) the independent dynamics exploited by mixed quantum classical (MQC) methods is best understood as a manifestation of entanglement viewed in a preferred basis, rather than a consequence of decoherence, and 2) the adiabatic Born Oppenheimer states satisfy the conditions of an approximate preferred basis. This perspective reconciles widely used approximations with a more fundamental structure of the theory and provides a systematic route to more reliable MQC strategies. In effect, we revisit MQC methods through the lens of preferred states, clarifying when they succeed and how they can be improved.</description>

      <title>On Ambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay in unbound pyridine monomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent report by Barik et al. [Nature Chemistry 14, 1098, 2022] on ambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) in unbound pyridine monomers proposes the formation of a pyridine cation via intermolecular Coulombic decay following a three-body association/collision, wherein all the three pyridine molecules are in the excited state. The collision-free conditions of the free-jet expansion, an abysmally low probability of finding three independently excited pyridine molecules in the vicinity of each other, and extremely low excited state lifetimes negate the possibility of ICD in unbound pyridine monomers. An alternate mechanism, wherein the pyridine monomer cation originates from the dissociative ionization of pyridine dimers following a three-photon absorption process, based on the translational energy measurements of pyridine cation is proposed.</description>

Abstract: We report the potential energy curve, the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer, non-adiabatic mass, relativistic, and leading-order QED corrections for the ground electronic state of the helium dimer cation; the higher-order QED and finite-nuclear size effects are also estimated. The computations are carried out with an improved error control and over a much broader configuration range compared to earlier work [D. Ferenc, V. I. Korobov, and E. M\'atyus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 213001 (2020)]. As a result, all rovibrational bound states are reported with an estimated accuracy of 0.005 cm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Parquet theory for molecular systems: Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Topological advantage for adsorbate chemisorption on conjugated chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.</description>
