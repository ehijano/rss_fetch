      <title>Two-dimensional heat transfer and melt flow in the laser-impact zone at selective laser melting of thin walls -- II: Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Part II of the present work concerns modeling and analyzing the experimental data obtained in Part I. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of two-dimensional conductive heat transfer and thermocapillary-driven convection is developed. The conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are numerically solved by a second-order Godunov finite-volume method using an original Riemann solver developed for the applied equation of state. The CFD model is validated by comparison with the experiments. Formation of two outward vortices in the melt pool is revealed. Surface-active impurities can make the surface tension-temperature function non-monotonous giving raise additional vortices with the opposite inward flow direction. The influence of melt convection on the melt pool size is not considerable in the conditions of selective laser melting (SLM). The flow velocity in the melt pool is around or less than the laser scanning speed. This means insufficient mixing in the melt pool. One cannot expect a complete homogenization of chemical composition when using powder blends in SLM. The correlation between the error of the Rosenthal model and the latent heat of fusion is carefully studied resulting an analytical model for estimating the melt pool depth. In the studied SLM cases, the accuracy of the developed analytical model is within 10% relative the CFD model. The obtained experimental and theoretical results indicate that the melt depth is approximately proportional to linear energy density LED in the typical conditions of SLM. This can be useful when optimizing the SLM process.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Turbulent Fountains in Frost Mitigation and Pollution Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of turbulent fountains as a tool for frost mitigation and pollution control in stratified ambient fluids. By examining the interaction between the ejected fountain fluid and the lower atmospheric layers, we develop predictive models to assess their impact on temperature distribution and the return of polluted ejected fluid to the ground. This analysis covers a range of fountain parameters, including $Fr^{-2}$ and $u^{\prime}/U$, where $Fr$ is the Froude number and $u^{\prime}/U$ represents the turbulent intensity at the inlet. Notably, we identify an optimal set of parameter values where the temperature rise is maximised, independent of the fountain's turbulence intensity. This optimal condition occurs in the so-called semi-collapse regime, as described by Saras\'ua et al. [Flow, Turbulence and Combustion, 112(4), 1009-1025 (2024)], where the returning fluid, mixed with warmer upper ambient layers, significantly increases local temperature. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully tuning fountain parameters to balance their effects on the surrounding environment, offering valuable insights for the practical use of turbulent fountains in environmental management.</description>

      <title>On Inverse Problems for Two-Dimensional Steady Supersonic Euler Flows past Curved Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the well-posedness of an inverse problem for determining the wedge boundary and associated two-dimensional steady supersonic Euler flow past the wedge, provided that the pressure distribution on the boundary surface of the wedge and the incoming state of the flow are given. We first establish the existence of wedge boundaries and associated entropy solutions of the inverse problem when the pressure on the wedge boundary is larger than that of the incoming flow but less than a critical value, and the total variation of the incoming flow and the pressure distribution is sufficiently small. This is achieved by carefully constructing suitable approximate solutions and approximate boundaries via developing a wave-front tracking algorithm and the rigorous proof of their strong convergence to a global entropy solution and a wedge boundary respectively. Then we establish the $L^{\infty}$--stability of the wedge boundaries, by introducing a modified Lyapunov functional for two different solutions with two distinct boundaries, each of which may contain a strong shock-front. The modified Lyapunov functional is carefully designed to control the distance between the two boundaries and is proved to be Lipschitz continuous with respect to the differences of the incoming flow and the pressure on the wedge, which leads to the existence of the Lipschitz semigroup. Finally, when the pressure distribution on the wedge boundary is sufficiently close to that of the incoming flow, using this semigroup, we compare two solutions of the inverse problem in the respective supersonic full Euler flow and potential flow and prove that, at $x&gt;0$, the distance between the two boundaries and the difference of the two solutions are of the same order of $x$ multiplied by the cube of the perturbations of the initial boundary data in $L^\infty\cap BV$.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for fast and accurate Statistical Computation of Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generative AI algorithm for addressing the challenging task of fast, accurate and robust statistical computation of three-dimensional turbulent fluid flows. Our algorithm, termed as GenCFD, is based on a conditional score-based diffusion model. Through extensive numerical experimentation with both incompressible and compressible fluid flows, we demonstrate that GenCFD provides very accurate approximation of statistical quantities of interest such as mean, variance, point pdfs, higher-order moments, while also generating high quality realistic samples of turbulent fluid flows and ensuring excellent spectral resolution. In contrast, ensembles of operator learning baselines which are trained to minimize mean (absolute) square errors regress to the mean flow. We present rigorous theoretical results uncovering the surprising mechanisms through which diffusion models accurately generate fluid flows. These mechanisms are illustrated with solvable toy models that exhibit the relevant features of turbulent fluid flows while being amenable to explicit analytical formulas.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained patchy turbulence in shear-thinning active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial suspensions and other active fluids can develop highly dynamical vortex states called mesoscale turbulence. Here, we reveal the pronounced effect of non-Newtonian rheology of the carrier fluid, concentrating on shear thinning. Remarkably, this leads to hysteretic emergence of the turbulent state as a function of activity. A self-sustained heterogeneous state of coexisting turbulent and quiescent areas is identified. We find the signature of a directed percolation transition. Our results are important, for instance, when addressing active objects in biological media.</description>

      <title>Hidden Turbulence in van Gogh's \textbf{\textit{The Starry Night}}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent skies have often inspired artists, particularly in the iconic swirls of Vincent van Gogh's \textbf{\textit{The Starry Night}}. For an extended period, debate has raged over whether the flow pattern in this masterpiece adheres to Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence. In contrast to previous studies that examined only part of this painting, {\textit{all and only the}} whirls/eddies in the painting are taken into account in this work, following the Richardson-Kolmogorov's cascade picture of turbulence. Consequently, the luminance's Fourier power spectrum spontaneously exhibits a characteristic $-5/3$ Kolmogorov-like power-law. This result suggests that van Gogh had a very careful observation of real flows, so that not only the sizes of whirls/eddies in \textbf{\textit{The Starry Night}} but also their relative distances and intensity follow the physical law that governs turbulent flows. Moreover, a "$-1$"-like power-law persists in the spectrum below the scales of the smallest whirls, hinting at Batchelor-type scalar turbulence with a high Schmidt number. Our study thus unveils the hidden turbulence captured within \textbf{\textit{The Starry Night}}.</description>

      <title>High-order Finite-Volume Central Targeted ENO Family Scheme for Compressible Flows in Unstructured Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-order Target ENO (TENO) scheme, known for its innovative weighting strategy, has demonstrated strong potential for complex flow predictions. This study extends the TENO weighting approach to develop non-oscillatory central TENO (CTENO and CTENOZ) family schemes for unstructured meshes. The CTENO schemes employ compact directional stencils, which increase the likelihood of finding stencils within smooth regions. The design is intentionally compact to simplify the implementation of directional stencils. An effective scale separation strategy is adopted using an ENO-like stencil selection method, which employs large central stencils in smooth regions to achieve high-order accuracy, and smaller directional stencils near discontinuities to improve shock-capturing capabilities. Extensive tests involving CWENO, TENO, CTENO, and CTENOZ schemes were conducted to assess their performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, parallel scalability, and computational efficiency. The findings indicate that the proposed CTENO and CTENOZ schemes deliver high-order precision, lower numerical dissipation, and excellent shock-capturing performance.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity suppresses intermittency in direct turbulent cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermittency refers to the broken self-similarity of turbulent flows caused by anomalous spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this Letter, we ask how intermittency is affected by a non-dissipative viscosity, known as odd viscosity (also Hall or gyro-viscosity), which appears in parity-breaking fluids such as magnetized polyatomic gases, electron fluids under magnetic field and spinning colloids or grains. Using a combination of Navier-Stokes simulations and theory, we show that intermittency is suppressed by odd viscosity at small scales. This effect is caused by parity-breaking waves, induced by odd viscosity, that break the multiple scale invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on this insight, we construct a two-channel helical shell model that reproduces the basic phenomenology of turbulent odd-viscous fluids including the suppression of anomalous scaling. Our findings illustrate how a fully developed direct cascade that is entirely self-similar can emerge below a tunable length scale, paving the way for designing turbulent flows with adjustable levels of intermittency.</description>

      <title>Capillary waves in miscible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the existence of capillary waves propagating along the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a wavenumber independent of frequency, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to an unexpected capillary-wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square gradient theories.</description>

      <title>Material Barriers to the Diffusive Magnetic Flux in Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has identified objective (frame-indifferent) material barriers that inhibit the transport of dynamically active vectorial quantities (such as linear momentum, angular momentum and vorticity) in Navier-Stokes flows. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a similar setting arises: the magnetic field vector impacts the evolution of the velocity field through the Lorentz force and hence is a dynamically active vector field. Here, we extend the theory of active material barriers from Navier-Stokes flows to MHD flows in order to locate frame-indifferent barriers to the diffusive transport of the magnetic field in turbulent two-dimensional and three-dimensional MHD flows. From this approach we obtain an algorithm for the automated extraction of such barriers from MHD turbulence data.</description>
