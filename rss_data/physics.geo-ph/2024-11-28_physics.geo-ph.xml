      <title>Quantification of Uncertainty and Its Propagation in Seismic Velocity Structure and Earthquake Source Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earthquake source inversions aimed at understanding diverse fault activities on earthquake faults using seismic observation data, uncertainties in velocity structure models are typically not considered. As a result, biases and underestimations of uncertainty can occur in source inversion. This article provides an overview of the author's efforts to address this issue by quantitatively evaluating the uncertainty in velocity structure models and appropriately accounting for its propagation into source inversion. First, the Bayesian multi-model source inversion method that can incorporate such uncertainties as probability distributions in the form of ensembles is explained. Next, a Bayesian traveltime tomography technique utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to quantify uncertainties in velocity structure models is introduced. Furthermore, the author's recent efforts to integrate these methods and apply them to hypocenter determination in the Nankai Trough region are briefly discussed. The article also outlines future prospects of source inversions considering uncertainties in velocity structure models and the anticipated role of the emerging scientific machine learning (SciML) methods such as PINN.</description>

      <title>Seismic swarms unveil the mechanisms driving shallow slow slip dynamics in the Copiap\'o ridge, Northern Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like earthquakes, slow slip events release elastic energy stored on faults. Yet, the mechanisms behind slow slip instability and its relationship with seismicity are debated. Here, we use a seismo-geodetic deployment to document a shallow slow slip event (SSE) in 2023 on the Chile subduction. We observe dense, migrating seismic swarms accompanying the SSE, comprised of interface activity and upper plate splay faulting. Our observations suggest that the slow slip initiation is driven by structurally-confined fluid overpressure in the fluid-rich surroundings of a subducted seamount. This is consistent with an observed acceleration and expansion of the SSE after a $M_L=5.3$ earthquake likely triggering an increase in interface permeability. Historical earthquake swarms highlight the persistent structural control and recurrent nature of such slow slip events. Our observations provide insight into the interactions between slow slip and seismicity, suggesting they are controlled by creep on a fluid-infiltrated fault with fractally distributed asperities.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa and temperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. In this work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram, elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a significant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture in full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures and pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic self-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of CaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The phase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and increases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting for temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound as a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations on the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to explain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal conductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism, shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the standard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic anharmonicity.</description>
