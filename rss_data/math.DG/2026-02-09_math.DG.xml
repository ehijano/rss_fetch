      <title>Soliton-type metrics associated with weighted CSCK metrics on Fano manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics, introduced by Lahdili as $(v,w)$-CSCK metrics, on Fano manifolds and their relationship with soliton-type metrics. In this paper, we introduce a weight function $g(v,w)$ associated with a pair of weight functions $(v,w)$. Assuming that $v$ and $g(v,w)$ are positive and log-concave on the moment polytope, we prove that the existence of a $(v,w)$-CSCK metric in the first Chern class is equivalent to the existence of a $g(v,w)$-soliton.
  We also explain that a $g(v,w)$-soliton arises naturally from Sasaki geometry. More precisely, let $(v,w)$ be the weight functions defining a weighted CSCK metric in $2\pi c_1(X)$ which gives rise to a $\hat{\xi}$-transverse extremal metric on an $S^1$-bundle $N$ in the canonical bundle of a Fano manifold $X$, where $\hat{\xi}$ is a possibly irregular Reeb field on $N$. We prove that the associated $g(v,w)$-soliton on $X$ gives rise to a $\hat{\xi}$-transverse Mabuchi soliton on $N$.</description>

      <title>Counting normals to closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following results:
  (1) For every generic closed smooth curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ there is a point with at least $6$ emanating normals to the curve. If the curve is knotted, there is a point with at least $8$ emanating normals.
  (2) For every generic closed piecewise linear curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ there is a point with at least $8$ emanating normals to the curve. If the curve is knotted, there is a point with at least $10$ emanating normals.
  The proof is based on the Morse theory for the squared distance function and self intersections of the focal surface.</description>

      <title>Quantitative partitioned index theorem and noncompact band-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gromov's band-width conjecture gives a precise upper bound for the width of a compact Riemannian band with positive scalar curvature lower bound, assuming that the cross-section of the band admits no positive scalar curvature metrics. Versions of this were proved by Cecchini and by Zeidler. In this paper, we develop a quantitative version of partitioned manifold index theory, which applies to noncompact hypersurfaces. Using this, we prove a version of Gromov's band-width estimate for possibly noncompact Riemannian bands.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism of cosymplectomorphism groups implies diffeomorphism of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if two closed, connected, regular cosymplectic manifolds have isomorphic groups of cosymplectomorphisms (as topological groups), then the underlying manifolds are diffeomorphic. The proof proceeds by characterizing the Reeb flow as the center of the group and descending the isomorphism to the symplectic base manifolds. We show that the isomorphism preserves the conjugacy class of the monodromy of the mapping torus, which ensures that the bundle structures, and thus the total spaces are equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for general $n\geq2$, we classify solutions to $n$-Laplacian Liouville equation with positive nonlinear Neumann boundary condition on the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$. Under the positive nonlinear Neumann boundary condition, our result extend the classification result for the second order Liouville equation in \cite{Li} from $n=2$ to general $n\geq2$, and also extend the classification result for critical $p$-Laplacian equation in \cite{Zhou} from $p&lt;n$ to $p=n$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev inequalities on noncompact Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth, complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with bounded Ricci curvature and positive injectivity radius, we derive a sharp Sobolev inequality for the embedding of $W^{1,p}(M)$ into $L^{\frac{np}{n-p}}(M)$, when $1\le p&lt; n$. We will first reduce the inequality to functions having support with small enough volume. In turn, we will show that the inequality for small volumes is implied by a first order uniform asymptotic expansion of the isoperimetric profile for $M$, for small volumes. We will then show that such an expansion follows from a local, uniform Sobolev inequality for functions in $W^{1,1}$, having support with small enough diameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there exists a solution of the $J$-equation on the total space of a holomorphic submersion if there exist solutions of the $J$-equation on the fibers and the base. The method is an adiabatic limit technique. We also partially prove the converse implication. More precisely, if the total space is $J$-nef, then each fiber is $J$-nef. In addition, if each fiber has a solution of the $J$-equation, then the base is also $J$-nef. Furthermore, we establish similar phenomena for the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation.</description>

      <title>Canonical Submersions in Nearly K\"ahler Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore submersions introduced by reducible holonomy representations of connections with parallel skew torsion. A submersion theorem extending previous, less general, results is given. As our main application we show that parallel 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds admit 1-dimensional submersions onto nearly K\"ahler orbifolds. As a secondary application we reprove that a certain class of nearly K\"ahler manifolds submerges onto quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds. This new proof gives an direct expression for the quaternionic structure on the base.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct solutions to the heterotic G$_2$ system on almost contact metric manifolds with reduced characteristic holonomy. We focus on $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds and $(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, the latter being a convenient reformulation of spin $\eta$-Einstein $\alpha$-Sasaki manifolds. Investigating a $1$-parameter family of G$_2$-connections on the tangent bundle, we obtain several approximate solutions as well as one new class of exact solutions on degenerate $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue of Jacobi operator and Rigidity Results for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain geometric upper bounds for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(J)$ of the Jacobi operator for both closed and compact with boundary hypersurfaces having constant mean curvature (CMC). As an application, we derive new rigidity results for the area of CMC hypersurfaces under suitable conditions on $\lambda_1(J)$ and the curvature of the ambient space. We also address the Jacobi--Steklov problem, proving geometric upper bounds for its first eigenvalue $\sigma_1(J)$ and deriving rigidity results related to the length of the boundary. Additionally, we present some results in higher dimensions related to the Yamabe invariants.</description>

      <title>On the nu-invariant of two-step nilmanifolds with closed G2-structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every non-vanishing spinor field on a Riemannian spin seven-manifold, Crowley, Goette, and Nordstr\"om defined the so-called $\nu$-invariant. This is an integer modulo $48$ that detects connected components of the moduli space of $\mathrm G_2$-structures on any seven-dimensional oriented spin manifold. The $\nu$-invariant can be defined in terms of Mathai--Quillen currents, harmonic spinors, and $\eta$-invariants of spin Dirac and odd-signature operator. We compute these data for certain families of left-invariant closed $\mathrm G_2$-structures on compact two-step nilmanifolds with their natural spin structure. Specifically, we establish the existence of non-invariant harmonic spinors and determine the parity of the dimension of the space of harmonic spinors. We deduce the vanishing of $\nu$ on invariant harmonic spinors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish solvability and uniqueness conditions for the linearized Ricci curvature equations on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, obtained without imposing restrictions on the interior geometry. The proof recasts the problem in cohomological terms by means of a generalized Hodge theory, based on the Boutet de Monvel calculus. The first cohomology, obstructing uniqueness, is always finite dimensional, whereas the second cohomology, obstructing solvability, is finite dimensional either in dimension three or when the boundary is empty. Through the Bochner technique, we prove vanishing theorems for these cohomologies; for the second cohomology, the argument also uses stress potentials and the sharp Poincar\'e inequality on spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study closed, positively curved $n$-manifolds that admit an effective, isometric $\mathbb{Z}_p^r$-action with a fixed point, where $p$ is an odd prime. For all sufficiently large $n$, we obtain a symmetry-rank bound in Theorem A that improves the $3n/8$ bound of Fang and Rong and of Ghazawneh. We improve on this bound for small odd primes $3\leq p\leq 19$ in Theorem B. One of our main tools comes from the theory of error-correcting codes and is of independent interest: we derive a finite-length Plotkin bound and a finite-length Elias-Bassalygo bound for $q$-ary codes and show that the finite-length Plotkin bound is asymptotically sharper for all primes $p \ge 23$.</description>

      <title>Integrable Geodesic Flows on Cones over Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of geodesics on cones over arbitrary $C^3$-smooth closed Riemannian manifolds. We show that the geodesic flow on such cones admits first integrals whose values uniquely determine almost all geodesics except for radial geodesics; thus, the geodesic flow is superintegrable. Moreover, we prove that the geodesic flow restricted to the open dense subset of the cotangent bundle corresponding to all non-radial trajectories is Liouville--Arnold integrable. This investigation is inspired by our recent results on Birkhoff billiards inside cones over convex manifolds where similar results hold true.</description>

      <title>Desingularizations of Conformally Kaehler, Einstein Orbifolds</title>

Abstract: Let {(M,g_i)} be a sequence of smooth compact oriented Einstein 4-manifolds of fixed Einstein constant $\lambda &gt; 0$ that Gromov-Hausdorff converges to a 4-dimensional Einstein orbifold X. Suppose, moreover, that the limit metric is Hermitian with respect to some complex structure on the limit orbifold X, that X has at least one singular point, and that every gravitational instanton that bubbles off from the sequence is anti-self-dual. Then, for all sufficiently large i, the given (M,g_i) are all Kaehler-Einstein. As a consequence, the limit orbifold X is also Kaehler-Einstein, and must in fact be one of the orbifold limits classified by Odaka, Spotti, and Sun.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^r$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, we actually prove such singularity germ is the cone vertex over a contact orbifold with weak K\"ahler-Einstein metric, forcing $r=1$. In particular, it admits a (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, which also extends to (canonical) actions of $\mathbb{H}^*\supset SU(2)$. These settle Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form by establishing the canonicity, the extensibility of the action, for instance. Our key idea is to use the Donaldson-Sun theory on local K\"ahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertions, assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)K\"ahler metrics. Conversely, our results can also be used to study the local behavior of such metrics around the germ.</description>
