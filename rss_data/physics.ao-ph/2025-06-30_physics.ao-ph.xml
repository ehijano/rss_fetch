      <title>Stochastic Coefficient of Variation: Assessing the Variability and Forecastability of Solar Irradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a robust framework for quantifying solar irradiance variability and forecastability through the Stochastic Coefficient of Variation (sCV) and the Forecastability (F). Traditional metrics, such as the standard deviation, fail to isolate stochastic fluctuations from deterministic trends in solar irradiance. By considering clear-sky irradiance as a dynamic upper bound of measurement, sCV provides a normalized, dimensionless measure of variability that theoretically ranges from 0 to 1. F extends sCV by integrating temporal dependencies via maximum autocorrelation, thus linking sCV with F. The proposed methodology is validated using synthetic cyclostationary time series and experimental data from 68 meteorological stations (in Spain). Our comparative analyses demonstrate that sCV and F proficiently encapsulate multi-scale fluctuations, while addressing significant limitations inherent in traditional metrics. This comprehensive framework enables a refined quantification of solar forecast uncertainty, supporting improved decision-making in flexibility procurement and operational strategies. By assessing variability and forecastability across multiple time scales, it enhances real-time monitoring capabilities and informs adaptive energy management approaches, such as dynamic outage management and risk-adjusted capacity allocation</description>

      <title>The First Compute Arms Race: the Early History of Numerical Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper traces the global race to apply early electronic computers to numerical weather prediction in the decades following World War Two. A brief overview of the early history of numerical weather prediction in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, and Japan is provided. Three critical factors that shaped the development of a national numerical weather prediction are identified: compute capabilities, institution building and state capacity, and talent. Several generalizable lessons are identified with a lens towards modern-day development of national strategies to leverage AI to accelerate scientific competitiveness.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>
