      <title>Optimally Fast Qubit Reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, qubit reset must be operated in an extremely short time, which incurs a thermodynamic cost within multiple orders of magnitude above the Landauer bound. We present a general framework to determine the minimal thermodynamic cost and the optimal protocol for arbitrary resetting speeds. Our study reveals the divergent behavior of minimal entropy production in the short-time limit depends on the convergence and divergence of the jump operators. For the convergent class, an inherent trade-off exists between the minimal required time and the set error probability, which hinders the Moore's law continuing in such cases. Moreover, we find the optimal protocol exhibits the similarity in the fast-driving regime for different times. To demonstrate our findings, we empoly fermionic and bosonic baths as examples. Our results suggest that the super-Ohmic bosonic heat bath is a suitable choice for qubit reset.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for classical and quantum uncertainty relations using stochastic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) and kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) provide tradeoff relations between measurement precision and thermodynamic cost such as entropy production and activity. Conventionally, these relations are derived using the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, which involves an auxiliary perturbation in deterministic differential equations governing the time evolution of the system's probability distribution. In this study, without relying on the previous formulation based on deterministic evolving equation, we demonstrate that all previously discovered uncertainty relations can be derived solely through the stochastic representation of the same dynamics. For this purpose, we propose a unified method based on stochastic representations for general Markovian dynamics. Extending beyond classical systems, we apply this method to Markovian open quantum systems by unraveling their dynamics, deriving quantum uncertainty relations that are physically more accessible and tighter in regimes where quantum effects play a significant role. This fully establishes uncertainty relations for both classical and quantum systems as intrinsic properties of their stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>Affine relationships between steady currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modeled by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains affine but the relation is not additive.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of a small system with surface degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have considered a model of a small finite system with internal particles and surface degrees of freedom. All the main statistical distributions were explicitly obtained, on a pre thermodynamic limit basis. The concept of temperature or any thermodynamic equations was not used. The distribution of coordinates of a surface element allows the rigorous determination of the pressure exerted by the internal particles. In this way, we have derived the equation of state for a small system with surface. It relates the pressure to the numbers of bulk and surface degrees of freedom, their mean energies and the volume. The mean potential energy of the surface was found to be higher than the mean kinetic energy, per degree of freedom. The obtained equation of state accounts for the influence of this excessive surface energy. In the thermodynamic limit, the temperature appears and the obtained equation of state transfers to the usual ideal gas one.</description>

      <title>Diffusion cascade in a model of interacting random walkers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relaxation of finite-wavevector density waves in a facilitated classical lattice gas. Linear hydrodynamics predicts that such perturbations should relax exponentially, but nonlinear effects were predicted to cause subexponential relaxation via nonperturbative long-time tails. We present a detailed numerical study of this effect. While our results clearly indicate the importance of nonlinear effects, we find that the wavevector-dependence of the late-time relaxation is clearly inconsistent with theoretical predictions. We discuss manifestations of hydrodynamic nonlinearities in mesoscopic samples and at short times.</description>

      <title>A kinetically constrained model exhibiting non-linear diffusion and jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles on a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated by means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Occupation time statistics for non-Markovian random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the occupation time statistics for non-Markovian random walkers based on the formalism of the generalized master equation for the Continuous-Time Random Walk. We also explore the case when the random walker additionally undergoes a stochastic resetting dynamics. We derive and solve the backward Feynman-Kac equation to find the characteristic function for the occupation time in an interval and for the half occupation time in the semi-infinite domain. We analyze the behaviour of the PDFs, the moments, the limiting distributions and the ergodic properties for both occupation times when the underlying random walk is normal or anomalous. For the half occupation time, we revisit the famous arcsine law and examine its validity pertaining to various regimes of the rest period of the walker. Our results have been verified with numerical simulations exhibiting an excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems, and associated phenomena, such as measurement-induced phase transitions, have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. To this end, we study the effects of continuous weak measurements and feedback control on isolated JJAs in the absence of any external thermal bath. The monitoring due to combined effect of measurements and feedback, inducing non-unitary evolution and dissipation, leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering the semiclassical, strong measurement/feedback and weak-coupling limits, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The SYK charging advantage as a random walk on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models as quantum batteries, highlighting their capacity to achieve quantum charging advantages. By analytically deriving the scaling of the charging power in SYK batteries, we identify the two key mechanisms underlying this advantage: the use of operators scaling extensively with system size $N$ and the facilitation of operator delocalization by specific graph structures. A novel graph-theoretic framework is introduced in which the charging process is recast as a random walk on a graph, enabling a quantitative analysis of operator spreading. Our results establish rigorous conditions for the quantum advantage in SYK batteries and extend these insights to graph-based SYK models, revealing broader implications for energy storage and quantum dynamics. This work opens avenues for leveraging quantum chaos and complex network structures in optimizing energy transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing fidelity in teleportation of a two-qubit state via a quantum communication channel formed by spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains due to a magnetic fieldxx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that two independent spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains provide an effective platform for the quantum teleportation of any entangled two-qubit state through the quantum communication channel formed by two Heisenberg dimers. The reliability of this quantum channel is assessed by comparing the concurrences, which quantify a strength of the bipartite entanglement of the initial input state and the readout output state. Additionally, we rigorously calculate quantities fidelity and average fidelity to evaluate the quality of the teleportation protocol depending on temperature and magnetic field. It is evidenced that the efficiency of quantum teleportation of arbitrary entangled two-qubit state through this quantum communication channel can be significantly enhanced by moderate magnetic fields. This enhancement can be attributed to the magnetic-field-driven transition from a quantum antiferromagnetic phase to a quantum ferrimagnetic phase, which supports realization of a fully entangled quantum channel suitable for efficient quantum teleportation. The polymeric trimer chains Cu3(P2O6OH)2 are proposed as an experimental resource of this quantum communication channel, which provides an efficient platform for realization of the quantum teleportation up to moderate temperatures 40 K and extremely high magnetic fields 80 T.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XY model on the honeycomb lattice: A comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examined the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in the two-dimensional XY model on the honeycomb lattice. To address its thermodynamical behavior, we conducted standard numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the simulated annealing protocol and entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau algorithm. The inverse transition temperature ($\beta_{BKT}$) was determined using the second ($\Upsilon$) and fourth-order ($\Upsilon_4$) helicity modulus as the order parameter. We also used the fourth-order Binder cumulant of the magnetization as an additional tool to address the critical properties of the model. Our finite-size scaling analysis suggests $\beta_{BKT} = 1.687(3)$ from $\Upsilon$ and $\beta_{BKT}=1.635(11)$ from $\Upsilon_4$. From the Binder cumulant crossing we found $\beta_{BKT}=1.724(2)$. These values deviate significantly from the expected theoretical value of $\sqrt{2}$. We believe that this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical assumptions regarding the analytical calculation may need to be revisited. Additionally, we calculated the vortex density and the formation energy of the vortex-antivortex pairs, where the obtained vortex formation energy is $2\mu=4.0(5)$. Upon comparison with the square lattice, our results support the notion of instability of the honeycomb lattice to support the spin long-range order and give additional backing to the critical behavior we found.</description>

      <title>The induced friction on a probe moving in a nonequilibrium medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a powerful combination of projection-operator method and path-space response theory, we derive the fluctuation dynamics of a slow inertial probe coupled to a steady nonequilibrium medium under the assumption of time-scale separation. The nonequilibrium is realized by external nongradient driving on the medium particles or by their (athermal) active self-propulsion. The resulting friction on the probe is an explicit time-correlation for medium observables and is decomposed into two terms, one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for equilibrium media, and a frenetic term that can take both signs. As an illustration, we give the exact expressions for the linear friction coefficient and noise amplitude of a probe in a rotating run-and-tumble medium. We find a transition to absolute negative probe friction as the nonequilibrium medium exhibits sufficient and persistent rotational current. There, the run-away of the probe to high speeds realizes a nonequilibrium-induced acceleration. Simulations show that its speed finally saturates, yielding a symmetric stationary probe-momentum distribution with two peaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensing of Stark weak field under the influence of Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The localization-delocalization transition can be leveraged as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization-delocalization transition potentials one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the ground state of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH) localization-delocalization transition. We consider the single-particle system and the system at half-filling. Our work reveals that the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers a superior scaling with respect to the system size in comparison to the pure stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimentally measuring fidelity-based QFI in a many-body system poses significant challenges. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provides a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>
