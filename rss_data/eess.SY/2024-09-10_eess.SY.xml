      <title>Dynamics modelling and path optimization for the on-orbit assembly of large flexible structures using a multi-arm robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling an on-orbit assembly mission scenario of a large flexible structure using a multi-arm robot. This methodology accounts for significant changes in inertia and flexibility throughout the mission, addressing the problem of coupling dynamics between the robot and the evolving flexible structure during the assembly phase. A three-legged walking robot is responsible for building the structure, with its primary goal being to walk stably on the flexible structure while picking up, carrying and assembling substructure components. To accurately capture the dynamics and interactions of all subsystems in the assembly scenario, various linear fractional representations (LFR) are developed, considering the changing geometrical configuration of the multi-arm robot, the varying flexible dynamics and uncertainties. A path optimization algorithm is proposed for the multi-arm robot, capable of selecting trajectories based on various cost functions related to different performance and stability metrics. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling methodology and path optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bridging Autoencoders and Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Reduced-order Modeling and Control of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and controlling complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs) often necessitate dimensionality reduction techniques to construct lower-order models for computational efficiency. This paper explores a deep autoencoding learning method for reduced-order modeling and control of dynamical systems governed by spatiotemporal PDEs. We first analytically show that an optimization objective for learning a linear autoencoding reduced-order model can be formulated to yield a solution closely resembling the result obtained through the dynamic mode decomposition with control algorithm. We then extend this linear autoencoding architecture to a deep autoencoding framework, enabling the development of a nonlinear reduced-order model. Furthermore, we leverage the learned reduced-order model to design controllers using stability-constrained deep neural networks. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the efficacy of our approach in both modeling and control using the example of a reaction-diffusion system.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Downlink Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cell-free massive MIMO systems with multiple distributed access points (APs) serving multiple users over the same time-frequency resources, downlink beamforming is done through spatial precoding. Precoding vectors can be optimally designed to use the minimum downlink transmit power while satisfying a quality-of-service requirement for each user. However, existing centralized solutions to beamforming optimization pose challenges such as high communication overhead and processing delay. On the other hand, distributed approaches either require data exchange over the network that scales with the number of antennas or solve the problem for cellular systems where every user is served by only one AP. In this paper, we formulate a multi-user beamforming optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power subject to per-user SINR requirements and propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. In our method, every AP solves an iterative optimization problem using its local channel state information. APs only need to share a real-valued vector of interference terms with the size of the number of users. Through simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm solves the optimization problem within tens of ADMM iterations and can effectively satisfy per-user SINR constraints.</description>

      <title>Advanced Energy-Efficient System for Precision Electrodermal Activity Monitoring in Stress Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signal acquisition system, designed to address the challenges of stress monitoring in contemporary society, where stress affects one in four individuals. Our system focuses on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of EDA measurements, a reliable indicator of stress. Traditional EDA monitoring solutions often grapple with trade-offs between sensor placement, cost, and power consumption, leading to compromised data accuracy. Our innovative design incorporates an adaptive gain mechanism, catering to the broad dynamic range and high-resolution needs of EDA data analysis. The performance of our system was extensively tested through simulations and a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB), achieving an error rate below 1\% and maintaining power consumption at a mere 700$\mu$A under a 3.7V power supply. This research contributes significantly to the field of wearable health technology, offering a robust and efficient solution for long-term stress monitoring.</description>

      <title>APEX: Attention on Personality based Emotion ReXgnition Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated emotion recognition has applications in various fields, such as human-machine interaction, healthcare, security, education, and emotion-aware recommendation/feedback systems. Developing methods to analyze human emotions accurately is essential to enable such diverse applications. Multiple studies have been conducted to explore the possibility of using physiological signals and machine-learning techniques to evaluate human emotions. Furthermore, internal factors such as personality have been considered and involved in emotion recognition. However, integrating personality that is user specific within traditional machine-learning methods that use user-agnostic large data sets has become a critical problem. This study proposes the APEX: attention on personality-based emotion recognition framework, in which multiple weak classifiers are trained on physiological signals of each participant's data, and the classification results are reweighed based on the personality correlations between corresponding subjects and test subjects. Experiments have been conducted on the ASCERTAIN dataset, and the results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing studies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Simple Neuromorphic Controller for Linear Systems: A Hybrid Systems Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze a neuromorphic controller, inspired by the leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal model, in closed-loop with a single-input single-output linear time-invariant system. The controller consists of two neuron-like variables and generates a spiking control input whenever one of these variables reaches a threshold. The control input is different from zero only at the spiking instants and, hence, between two spiking times the system evolves in open-loop. Exploiting the hybrid nature of the integrate-and-fire neuronal dynamics, we present a hybrid modeling framework to design and analyze this new controller. In the particular case of single-state linear time-invariant plants, we prove a practical stability property for the closed-loop system, we ensure the existence of a strictly positive dwell-time between spikes, and we relate these properties to the parameters in the neurons. The results are illustrated in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-Based and Physically Motivated Koopman Lifted States for Wind Farm MPC: A Comparative Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Autoencoder (AE) models to identify Koopman-based linear representations for designing model predictive control (MPC) for wind farms. Wake interactions in wind farms are challenging to model, previously addressed with Koopman lifted states. In this study we investigate the performance of two AE models: The first AE model estimates the wind speeds acting on the turbines these are affected by changes in turbine control inputs. The wind speeds estimated by this AE model are then used in a second step to calculate the power output via a simple turbine model based on physical equations. The second AE model directly estimates the wind farm output, i.e., both turbine and wake dynamics are modeled. The primary inquiry of this study addresses whether any of these two AE-based models can surpass previously identified Koopman models based on physically motivated lifted states. We find that the first AE model, which estimates the wind speed and hence includes the wake dynamics, but excludes the turbine dynamics outperforms the existing physically motivated Koopman model. However, the second AE model, which estimates the farm power directly, underperforms when the turbines' underlying physical assumptions are correct. We additionally investigate specific conditions under which the second, purely data-driven AE model can excel: Notably, when modeling assumptions, such as the wind turbine power coefficient, are erroneous and remain unchecked within the MPC controller. In such cases, the data-driven AE models, when updated with recent data reflecting changed system dynamics, can outperform physics-based models operating under outdated assumptions.</description>

      <title>On Epistemic Properties in Discrete-Event Systems: A Uniform Framework and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the property verification problem for partially-observed DES from a new perspective. Specifically, we consider the problem setting where the system is observed by two agents independently, each with its own observation. The purpose of the first agent, referred to as the low-level observer, is to infer the actual behavior of the system, while the second, referred to as the high-level observer, aims to infer the knowledge of Agent 1 regarding the system. We present a general notion called the epistemic property capturing the inference from the high-level observer to the low-level observer. A typical instance of this definition is the notion of high-order opacity, which specifies that the intruder does not know that the system knows some critical information. This formalization is very general and supports any user-defined information-state-based knowledge between the two observers. We demonstrate how the general definition of epistemic properties can be applied in different problem settings such as information leakage diagnosis or tactical cooperation without explicit communications. Finally, we provide a systematic approach for the verification of epistemic properties. Particularly, we identify some fragments of epistemic properties that can be verified more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Cooptimizing Safety and Performance with a Control-Constrained Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems have witnessed a rapid increase in their capabilities, but it remains a challenge for them to perform tasks both effectively and safely. The fact that performance and safety can sometimes be competing objectives renders the cooptimization between them difficult. One school of thought is to treat this cooptimization as a constrained optimal control problem with a performance-oriented objective function and safety as a constraint. However, solving this constrained optimal control problem for general nonlinear systems remains challenging. In this work, we use the general framework of constrained optimal control, but given the safety state constraint, we convert it into an equivalent control constraint, resulting in a state and time-dependent control-constrained optimal control problem. This equivalent optimal control problem can readily be solved using the dynamic programming principle. We show the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution of a certain Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Partial Differential Equation (HJB-PDE). Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a two-dimensional case study, and the experiment shows that the controller synthesized using our method consistently outperforms the baselines, both in safety and performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low-Thrust Orbit Transfers Made Easy: A Direct Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08160v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of low-thrust, multi-revolution orbit transfer trajectories is often regarded as a difficult problem in modern astrodynamics. In this paper, a flexible and computationally efficient approach is presented for the optimization of low-thrust orbit transfers under eclipse constraints. The proposed approach leverages a new dynamic model of the orbital motion and a Lyapunov-based initial guess generation scheme that is very easy to tune. A multi-objective, single-phase formulation of the optimal control problem is devised, which provides a convenient way to trade off fuel consumption and time of flight. A distinctive feature of such a formulation is that it requires no prior information about the structure of the optimal solution. Simulation results for two benchmark orbit transfer scenarios indicate that minimum-time, minimum-fuel and mixed time/fuel-optimal instances of the control problem can be readily solved via direct collocation, while incurring a significantly lower computational demand with respect to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>A Centralized Discovery-Based Method for Integrating Data Distribution Service and Time-Sensitive Networking in In-Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the electronic and electrical architecture (E/EA) of intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs) evolves, traditional distributed and signal-oriented architectures are being replaced by centralized, service-oriented architectures (SOA). This new generation of E/EA demands in-vehicle networks (IVNs) that offer high bandwidth, real-time, reliability, and service-oriented. data distribution service (DDS) and time-sensitive networking (TSN) are increasingly adopted to address these requirements. However, research on the integrated deployment of DDS and TSN in automotive applications is still in its infancy. This paper presents a DDS over TSN (DoT) communication architecture based on the centralized discovery architecture (CDA). First, a lightweight DDS implementation (FastDDS-lw) is developed for resource-constrained in-vehicle devices. Next, a DDS flow identification algorithm (DFIA) based on the CDA is introduced to identify potential DDS flows during the discovery phase automatically. Finally, the DoT communication architecture is designed, incorporating FastDDS-lw and DFIA. Experimental results show that the DoT architecture significantly reduces end-to-end latency and jitter for critical DDS flows compared to traditional Ethernet. Additionally, DoT provides an automated network configuration method that completes within a few tens of milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Faster Q-Learning Algorithms for Restless Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Whittle index learning algorithm for restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB). We first present Q-learning algorithm and its variants -- speedy Q-learning (SQL), generalized speedy Q-learning (GSQL) and phase Q-learning (PhaseQL). We also discuss exploration policies -- $\epsilon$-greedy and Upper confidence bound (UCB). We extend the study of Q-learning and its variants with UCB policy. We illustrate using numerical example that Q-learning with UCB exploration policy has faster convergence and PhaseQL with UCB have fastest convergence rate. We next extend the study of Q-learning variants for index learning to RMAB. The algorithm of index learning is two-timescale variant of stochastic approximation, on slower timescale we update index learning scheme and on faster timescale we update Q-learning assuming fixed index value. We study constant stepsizes two timescale stochastic approximation algorithm. We describe the performance of our algorithms using numerical example. It illustrate that index learning with Q learning with UCB has faster convergence that $\epsilon$ greedy. Further, PhaseQL (with UCB and $\epsilon$ greedy) has the best convergence than other Q-learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>When Learning Meets Dynamics: Distributed User Connectivity Maximization in UAV-Based Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed management over Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based communication networks (UCNs) has attracted increasing research attention. In this work, we study a distributed user connectivity maximization problem in a UCN. The work features a horizontal study over different levels of information exchange during the distributed iteration and a consideration of dynamics in UAV set and user distribution, which are not well addressed in the existing works. Specifically, the studied problem is first formulated into a time-coupled mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. A heuristic two-stage UAV-user association policy is proposed to faster determine the user connectivity. To tackle the NP-hard problem in scalable manner, the distributed user connectivity maximization algorithm 1 (DUCM-1) is proposed under the multi-agent deep Q learning (MA-DQL) framework. DUCM-1 emphasizes on designing different information exchange levels and evaluating how they impact the learning convergence with stationary and dynamic user distribution. To comply with the UAV dynamics, DUCM-2 algorithm is developed which is devoted to autonomously handling arbitrary quit's and join-in's of UAVs in a considered time horizon. Extensive simulations are conducted i) to conclude that exchanging state information with a deliberated task-specific reward function design yields the best convergence performance, and ii) to show the efficacy and robustness of DUCM-2 against the dynamics.</description>

      <title>PEERNet: An End-to-End Profiling Tool for Real-Time Networked Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked robotic systems balance compute, power, and latency constraints in applications such as self-driving vehicles, drone swarms, and teleoperated surgery. A core problem in this domain is deciding when to offload a computationally expensive task to the cloud, a remote server, at the cost of communication latency. Task offloading algorithms often rely on precise knowledge of system-specific performance metrics, such as sensor data rates, network bandwidth, and machine learning model latency. While these metrics can be modeled during system design, uncertainties in connection quality, server load, and hardware conditions introduce real-time performance variations, hindering overall performance. We introduce PEERNet, an end-to-end and real-time profiling tool for cloud robotics. PEERNet enables performance monitoring on heterogeneous hardware through targeted yet adaptive profiling of system components such as sensors, networks, deep-learning pipelines, and devices. We showcase PEERNet's capabilities through networked robotics tasks, such as image-based teleoperation of a Franka Emika Panda arm and querying vision language models using an Nvidia Jetson Orin. PEERNet reveals non-intuitive behavior in robotic systems, such as asymmetric network transmission and bimodal language model output. Our evaluation underscores the effectiveness and importance of benchmarking in networked robotics, demonstrating PEERNet's adaptability. Our code is open-source and available at github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/PEERNet.</description>

      <title>PaRCE: Probabilistic and Reconstruction-Based Competency Estimation for Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>The Lynchpin of In-Memory Computing: A Benchmarking Framework for Vector-Matrix Multiplication in RRAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Von Neumann bottleneck, a fundamental challenge in conventional computer architecture, arises from the inability to execute fetch and data operations simultaneously due to a shared bus linking processing and memory units. This bottleneck significantly limits system performance, increases energy consumption, and exacerbates computational complexity. Emerging technologies such as Resistive Random Access Memories (RRAMs), leveraging crossbar arrays, offer promising alternatives for addressing the demands of data-intensive computational tasks through in-memory computing of analog vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) operations. However, the propagation of errors due to device and circuit-level imperfections remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce MELISO (In-Memory Linear Solver), a comprehensive end-to-end VMM benchmarking framework tailored for RRAM-based systems. MELISO evaluates the error propagation in VMM operations, analyzing the impact of RRAM device metrics on error magnitude and distribution. This paper introduces the MELISO framework and demonstrates its utility in characterizing and mitigating VMM error propagation using state-of-the-art RRAM device metrics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the inherited vulnerability of electric distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the vulnerability of electric networks with a complex network approach has produced significant results in the last decade, especially for transmission networks. These studies have shown that there are causal relations between certain structural properties of networks and their vulnerabilities, leading to an inherent weakness. The purpose of present work was twofold: to test the hypotheses already examined on evolving transmission networks and to gain a deeper understanding on the nature of these inherent weaknesses. For this, historical models of a medium-voltage distribution network supply area were reconstructed and analysed. Topological efficiency of the networks was calculated against node and edge removals of different proportions. We found that the tolerance of the evolving grid remained practically unchanged during the examined period, implying that the increase in size is dominantly caused by the connection of geographically and spatially constrained supply areas and not by an evolutionary process. We also show that probability density functions of centrality metrics, typically connected to vulnerability, show only minor variation during the early evolution of the examined distribution network, and in many cases resemble the properties of the modern days.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Iterative Motion Learning (AI-MOLE) of a SCARA Robot for Automated Myocardial Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stem cell therapy is a promising approach to treat heart insufficiency and benefits from automated myocardial injection which requires highly precise motion of a robotic manipulator that is equipped with a syringe. This work investigates whether sufficiently precise motion can be achieved by combining a SCARA robot and learning control methods. For this purpose, the method Autonomous Iterative Motion Learning (AI-MOLE) is extended to be applicable to multi-input/multi-output systems. The proposed learning method solves reference tracking tasks in systems with unknown, nonlinear, multi-input/multi-output dynamics by iteratively updating an input trajectory in a plug-and-play fashion and without requiring manual parameter tuning. The proposed learning method is validated in a preliminary simulation study of a simplified SCARA robot that has to perform three desired motions. The results demonstrate that the proposed learning method achieves highly precise reference tracking without requiring any a priori model information or manual parameter tuning in as little as 15 trials per motion. The results further indicate that the combination of a SCARA robot and learning method achieves sufficiently precise motion to potentially enable automatic myocardial injection if similar results can be obtained in a real-world setting.</description>

      <title>Superior Computer Chess with Model Predictive Control, Reinforcement Learning, and Rollout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we apply model predictive control (MPC), rollout, and reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies to computer chess. We introduce a new architecture for move selection, within which available chess engines are used as components. One engine is used to provide position evaluations in an approximation in value space MPC/RL scheme, while a second engine is used as nominal opponent, to emulate or approximate the moves of the true opponent player.
  We show that our architecture improves substantially the performance of the position evaluation engine. In other words our architecture provides an additional layer of intelligence, on top of the intelligence of the engines on which it is based. This is true for any engine, regardless of its strength: top engines such as Stockfish and Komodo Dragon (of varying strengths), as well as weaker engines.
  Structurally, our basic architecture selects moves by a one-move lookahead search, with an intermediate move generated by a nominal opponent engine, and followed by a position evaluation by another chess engine. Simpler schemes that forego the use of the nominal opponent, also perform better than the position evaluator, but not quite by as much. More complex schemes, involving multistep lookahead, may also be used and generally tend to perform better as the length of the lookahead increases.
  Theoretically, our methodology relies on generic cost improvement properties and the superlinear convergence framework of Newton's method, which fundamentally underlies approximation in value space, and related MPC/RL and rollout/policy iteration schemes. A critical requirement of this framework is that the first lookahead step should be executed exactly. This fact has guided our architectural choices, and is apparently an important factor in improving the performance of even the best available chess engines.</description>

      <title>Self-calibrated Microring Weight Function for Neuromorphic Optical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a microring resonator-based weight function for neuromorphic photonic applications achieving a record-high precision of 11.3 bits and accuracy of 9.3 bits for 2 Gbps input optical signals. The system employs an all-analog self-referenced proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to perform real-time temperature stabilization within a range of up to 60 degree Celsius. A self-calibrated weight function is demonstrated for a range of 6 degree Celsius with a single initial calibration and minimal accuracy and precision degradation. By monitoring the through and drop ports of the microring with variable gain transimpedance amplifiers, accurate and precise weight adjustment is achieved, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. These findings underscore the system's robustness to dynamic thermal environments, highlighting the potential for high-speed reconfigurable analog photonic networks.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-based Approach Towards Traceable Behavior Specifications in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicles in public traffic that are equipped with Automated Driving Systems are subject to a number of expectations: Among other aspects, their behavior should be safe, conforming to the rules of the road and provide mobility to their users. This poses challenges for the developers of such systems: Developers are responsible for specifying this behavior, for example, in terms of requirements at system design time. As we will discuss in the article, this specification always involves the need for assumptions and trade-offs. As a result, insufficiencies in such a behavior specification can occur that can potentially lead to unsafe system behavior. In order to support the identification of specification insufficiencies, requirements and respective assumptions need to be made explicit. In this article, we propose the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis as an ontology-based approach to specify the behavior for an Automated Driving System equipped vehicle. We use ontologies to formally represent specified behavior for a targeted operational environment, and to establish traceability between specified behavior and the addressed stakeholder needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis in two example scenarios and evaluate our results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian hypergame approach to equilibrium stability and robustness in moving target defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the equilibrium stability and robustness in a class of moving target defense problems, in which players have both incomplete information and asymmetric cognition. We first establish a Bayesian Stackelberg game model for incomplete information and then employ a hypergame reformulation to address asymmetric cognition. With the core concept of the hyper Bayesian Nash equilibrium (HBNE), a condition for achieving both the strategic and cognitive stability in equilibria can be realized by solving linear equations. Moreover, to deal with players' underlying perturbed knowledge, we study the equilibrium robustness by presenting a condition of robust HBNE under the given configuration. Experiments evaluate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Ground Fault Detection for Inverter-Based Microgrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground fault detection in inverter-based microgrid (IBM) systems is challenging, particularly in a real-time setting, as the fault current deviates slightly from the nominal value. This difficulty is reinforced when there are partially decoupled disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The conventional solution of installing more relays to obtain additional measurements is costly and also increases the complexity of the system. In this paper, we propose a data-assisted diagnosis scheme based on an optimization-based fault detection filter with the output current as the only measurement. Modeling the microgrid dynamics and the diagnosis filter, we formulate the filter design as a quadratic programming (QP) problem that accounts for decoupling partial disturbances, robustness to non-decoupled disturbances and modeling uncertainties by training with data, and ensuring fault sensitivity simultaneously. To ease the computational effort, we also provide an approximate but analytical solution to this QP. Additionally, we use classical statistical results to provide a thresholding mechanism that enjoys probabilistic false-alarm guarantees. Finally, we implement the IBM system with Simulink and Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulations.</description>

      <title>Joint State and Sparse Input Estimation in Linear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparsity constraints on the control inputs of a linear dynamical system naturally arise in several practical applications such as networked control, computer vision, seismic signal processing, and cyber-physical systems. In this work, we consider the problem of jointly estimating the states and sparse inputs of such systems from low-dimensional (compressive) measurements. Due to the low-dimensional measurements, conventional Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms fail to accurately estimate the states and inputs. We present a Bayesian approach that exploits the input sparsity to significantly improve estimation accuracy. Sparsity in the input estimates is promoted by using different prior distributions on the input. We investigate two main approaches: regularizer-based MAP, and {Bayesian learning-based estimation}. We also extend the approaches to handle control inputs with common support and analyze the time and memory complexities of the presented algorithms. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and time/memory complexities, especially in the low-dimensional measurement regime.</description>

      <title>The Fragile Nature of Road Transportation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major cities worldwide experience problems with the performance of their road transportation systems, and the continuous increase in traffic demand presents a substantial challenge to the optimal operation of urban road networks and the efficiency of traffic control strategies. The operation of transportation systems is widely considered to display fragile property, i.e., the loss in performance increases exponentially with the linearly increasing magnitude of disruptions. Meanwhile, the risk engineering community is embracing the novel concept of antifragility, enabling systems to learn from historical disruptions and exhibit improved performance under black swan events. In this study, based on established traffic models, namely fundamental diagrams and macroscopic fundamental diagrams, we first conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis to prove the fragile nature of the systems theoretically. Subsequently, we propose a skewness-based indicator that can be readily applied to cross-compare the degree of fragility for different networks solely dependent on the MFD-related parameters. At last, by taking real-world stochasticity into account, we implemented a numerical simulation with realistic network data to bridge the gap between the theoretical proof and the real-world operations, to reflect the potential impact of uncertainty on the fragility of the systems. This work aims to demonstrate the fragile nature of road transportation systems and help researchers better comprehend the necessity to consider explicitly antifragile design for future traffic control strategies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a hybrid control system called a hybrid integrator-gain system (HIGS) based integral resonant controller (IRC) to stabilize negative imaginary (NI) systems. A HIGS-based IRC has a similar structure to an IRC, with the integrator replaced by a HIGS. We show that a HIGS-based IRC is an NI system. Also, for a SISO NI system with a minimal realization, we show there exists a HIGS-based IRC such that their closed-loop interconnection is asymptotically stable. Also, we propose a proportional-integral-double-integral resonant controller and a HIGS-based proportional-integral-double-integral resonant controller, and we show that both of them can be applied to asymptotically stabilize an NI system. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Clarity-Aware Dynamic Coverage with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents two algorithms for multi-agent dynamic coverage in spatiotemporal environments, where the coverage algorithms are informed by the method of data assimilation. In particular, we show that by explicitly modeling the environment using a Gaussian Process (GP) model, and considering the sensing capabilities and the dynamics of a team of robots, we can design an estimation algorithm and multi-agent coverage controller that explores and estimates the state of the spatiotemporal environment. The uncertainty of the estimate is quantified using clarity, an information-theoretic metric, where higher clarity corresponds to lower uncertainty. By exploiting the relationship between GPs and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) we quantify the increase in clarity of the estimated state at any position due to a measurement taken from any other position. We use this relationship to design two new coverage controllers, both of which scale well with the number of agents exploring the domain, assuming the robots can share the map of the clarity over the spatial domain via communication. We demonstrate the algorithms through a realistic simulation of a team of robots collecting wind data over a region in Austria.</description>

The proposed formulation combines a certainty equivalent economic MPC with a simple least-squares parameter adaptation. For the resulting adaptive economic MPC scheme, we derive strong asymptotic and transient performance guarantees.

      <title>Learning-Based Efficient Approximation of Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) bypasses the need for system identification by directly leveraging raw data to formulate optimal control policies. However, the size of the optimization problem in DeePC grows linearly with respect to the data size, which prohibits its application to resource-constrained systems due to high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation of DeePC, whose size is invariant with respect to the amount of data collected, via differentiable convex programming. Specifically, the optimization problem in DeePC is decomposed into two parts: a control objective and a scoring function that evaluates the likelihood of a guessed I/O sequence, the latter of which is approximated with a size-invariant learned optimization problem. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a quadruple tank system, illustrating that the learned controller can reduce the computational time of DeePC by a factor of 5 while maintaining its control performance.</description>

      <title>Edge Computing for IoT: Novel Insights from a Comparative Analysis of Access Control Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IoT edge computing positions computing resources closer to the data sources to reduce the latency, relieve the bandwidth pressure on the cloud, and enhance data security. Nevertheless, data security in IoT edge computing still faces critical threats (e.g., data breaches). Access control is fundamental for mitigating these threats. However, IoT edge computing introduces notable challenges for achieving resource-conserving, low-latency, flexible, and scalable access control. To review recent access control measures, we novelly organize them according to different data lifecycles--data collection, storage, and usage--and, meanwhile, review blockchain technology in this novel organization. In this way, we provide novel insights and envisage several potential research directions. This survey can help readers find gaps systematically and prompt the development of access control techniques in IoT edge computing under the intricacy of innovations in access control.</description>

      <title>Risk-Averse Resilient Operation of Electricity Grid Under the Risk of Wildfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildfires and other extreme weather conditions due to climate change are stressing the aging electrical infrastructure. Power utilities have implemented public safety power shutoffs as a method to mitigate the risk of wildfire by proactively de-energizing some power lines, which leaves customers without power. System operators have to make a compromise between de-energizing of power lines to avoid the wildfire risk and energizing those lines to serve the demand. In this work, with a quantified wildfire ignition risk of each line, a resilient operation problem is presented in power systems with a high penetration level of renewable generation resources. A two-stage robust optimization problem is formulated and solved using column-and-constraint generation algorithm to find improved balance between the de-energization of power lines and the customers served. Different penetration levels of renewable generation to mitigate the impact of extreme fire hazard situations on the energization of customers is assessed. The validity of the presented robust optimization algorithm is demonstrated on various test cases.</description>

      <title>The Dilemma of Electricity Grid Expansion Planning in Areas at the Risk of Wildfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilities consider public safety power shut-offs imperative for the mitigation of wildfire risk. This paper presents expansion planning of power system under fire hazard weather conditions. The power lines are quantified based on the risk of fire ignition. A 10-year expansion planning scenario is discussed to supply power to customers by considering three decision variables: distributed solar generation; modification of existing power lines; addition of new lines. Two-stage robust optimization problem is formulated and solved using Column-and-Constraint Generation Algorithm to find improved balance among de-energization of customers, distributed solar generation, modification of power lines, and addition of new lines. It involves lines de-energization of high wildfire risk regions and serving the customers by integrating distributed solar generation. The impact of de-energization of lines on distributed solar generation is assessed. The number of hours each line is energized and total load shedding during a 10-year period is evaluated. Different uncertainty levels for system demand and solar energy integration are considered to find the impact on the total operation cost of the system. The effectiveness of the presented algorithm is evaluated on 6- and 118-bus systems.</description>

      <title>Upstream Allocation of Bidirectional Load Demand by Power Packetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power packet dispatching system has been studied for power management with strict tie to an accompanying information system through power packetization. In the system, integrated units of transfer of power and information, called power packets, are delivered through a network of apparatuses called power packet routers. This paper proposes upstream allocation of a bidirectional load demand represented by a sequence of power packets to power sources. We first develop a scheme of power packet routing for upstream allocation of load demand with full integration of power and information transfer. The routing scheme is then proved to enable packetized management of bidirectional load demand, which is of practical importance for applicability to, e.g., electric drives in motoring and regenerating operations. We present a way of packetizing the bidirectional load demand and realizing the power and information flow under the upstream allocation scheme. The viability of the proposed methods is demonstrated through experiments.</description>

      <title>Design of CANSAT for Air Quality Monitoring for an altitude of 900 meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and development of NAMBI-VJ, a CANSAT specifically designed for air quality monitoring and stabilization. The CANSAT's cylindrical structure, measuring 310mm in height and 125mm in diameter, is equipped with a mechanical gyroscope for stabilization and a spill-hole parachute for controlled descent. The primary objective of this research is to create a compact, lightweight satellite capable of monitoring air quality parameters such as particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), longitude, and latitude. To achieve this, the CANSAT utilizes Zigbee communication to transmit data to a ground station. Experimental testing involved dropping the CANSAT from an altitude of 900 meters using a drone. The results demonstrate the CANSAT's ability to successfully gather and transmit air quality data, highlighting its potential for environmental monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-art review and synthesis: A requirement-based roadmap for standardized predictive maintenance automation using digital twin technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent digital advances have popularized predictive maintenance (PMx), offering enhanced efficiency, automation, accuracy, cost savings, and independence in maintenance processes. Yet, PMx continues to face numerous limitations such as poor explainability, sample inefficiency of data-driven methods, complexity of physics-based methods, and limited generalizability and scalability of knowledge-based methods. This paper proposes leveraging Digital Twins (DTs) to address these challenges and enable automated PMx adoption on a larger scale. While DTs have the potential to be transformative, they have not yet reached the maturity needed to bridge these gaps in a standardized manner. Without a standard definition guiding this evolution, the transformation lacks a solid foundation for development. This paper provides a requirement-based roadmap to support standardized PMx automation using DT technologies. Our systematic approach comprises two primary stages. First, we methodically identify the Informational Requirements (IRs) and Functional Requirements (FRs) for PMx, which serve as a foundation from which any unified framework must emerge. Our approach to defining and using IRs and FRs as the backbone of any PMx DT is supported by the proven success of these requirements as blueprints in other areas, such as product development in the software industry. Second, we conduct a thorough literature review across various fields to assess how these IRs and FRs are currently being applied within DTs, enabling us to identify specific areas where further research is needed to support the progress and maturation of requirement-based PMx DTs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sliding Performance with Aerial Robots: Analysis and Solutions for Non-Actuated Multi-Wheel Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliding tasks performed by aerial robots are valuable for inspection and simple maintenance tasks at height, such as non-destructive testing and painting. Although various end-effector designs have been used for such tasks, non-actuated wheel configurations are more frequently applied thanks to their rolling capability for sliding motion, mechanical simplicity, and lightweight design. Moreover, a non-actuated multi-wheel (more than one wheel) configuration in the end-effector design allows the placement of additional equipment e.g., sensors and tools in the center of the end-effector tip for applications. However, there is still a lack of studies on crucial contact conditions during sliding using aerial robots with such an end-effector design. In this article, we investigate the key challenges associated with sliding operations using aerial robots equipped with multiple non-actuated wheels through in-depth analysis grounded in physical experiments. The experimental data is used to create a simulator that closely captures real-world conditions. We propose solutions from both mechanical design and control perspectives to improve the sliding performance of aerial robots. From a mechanical standpoint, design guidelines are derived from experimental data. From a control perspective, we introduce a novel pressure-sensing-based control framework that ensures reliable task execution, even during sliding maneuvers. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches are then validated and compared using the built simulator, particularly in high-risk scenarios.</description>

      <title>Inverse Particle Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16623</link>

Abstract: In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying the cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer the adversary's estimate of the target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like the inverse Kalman filter (I-KF), inverse extended KF (I-EKF), and inverse unscented KF (I-UKF). However, these filters typically assume additive Gaussian noise models and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. In contrast, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and presents the development of an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF to address scenarios where system information is unknown to the defender. Using the recursive Cramer-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different systems demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filter.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic energy forecasting through quantile regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient energy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy production, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are needed. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic factors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This study explores a non-parametric method based on \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy prediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for the DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional scripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.</description>
