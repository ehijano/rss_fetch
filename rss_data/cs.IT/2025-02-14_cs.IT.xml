      <title>Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Artificial Noise Aided Beam Focusing Design in Near-Field Terahertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel low-complexity artificial noise (AN) aided beam focusing scheme in a near-field terahertz wiretap communication system. In this system, the base station (BS) equipped with a large-scale array transmits signals to a legitimate user, while mitigating information leakage to an eavesdropper. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the secrecy rate achieved at the legitimate user and solve it by designing the optimal beam focusing and power allocation. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement achieved by the proposed AN aided beam focusing scheme, especially when the eavesdropper is located closer to the BS than the legitimate user.</description>

      <title>Masked Modulation: High-Throughput Half-Duplex ISAC Transmission Waveform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables numerous innovative wireless applications. Communication-centric design is a practical choice for the construction of the sixth generation (6G) ISAC networks. Continuous-wave-based ISAC systems, with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) being a representative example, suffer from the self-interference (SI) problem, and hence are less suitable for long-range sensing. On the other hand, pulse-based half-duplex ISAC systems are free of SI, but are also less favourable for high-throughput communication scenarios. In this treatise, we propose MASked Modulation (MASM), a half-duplex ISAC waveform design scheme, which minimises a range blindness metric, referred to as "range glint", given a duty cycle (proportional to communication throughput) constraint. In particular, MASM is capable of supporting high-throughput communication (~50% duty cycle) under mild range glint. Moreover, MASM can be flexibly adapted to frame-level waveform designs by operating on the slow-time scale. In terms of optimal transmit mask design, a set of masks is shown to be ideal in the sense of sidelobe level and range glint intensity.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Error Floor of Error Correction Code Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the success of transformer architectures across diverse applications, the error correction code transformer (ECCT) has gained significant attention for its superior decoding performance. In spite of its advantages, the error floor phenomenon in ECCT decoding remains unexplored. We present the first investigation of the error floor issue in ECCT and propose a hybrid decoding approach that integrates hard decision decoders as pre- and post-decoders with ECCT to effectively lower the error floor. In particular, we introduce a novel loss function for ECCT that considers the dynamics of hybrid decoding algorithm. Training ECCT with the proposed loss function enhances its ability to correct specific error patterns by taking into account its interaction with the auxiliary decoders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid decoder with the novel loss function significantly outperforms the original ECCT in both the waterfall and the error floor regions.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication with Distributed Rate-Limited Helpers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with two rate-limited helpers who observe the channel state sequence and the feedback sequence, respectively. Depending on the timing of compressing and using the state information, our proposed coding scheme gives an inner bound of the capacity-compression-distortion tradeoff region. The tradeoff is realized by sending part of the state information at the beginning of the transmission to facilitate the communication and compressing the remaining part together with the feedback signal. The inner bound becomes tight bounds in several special cases.</description>

      <title>XAInomaly: Explainable and Interpretable Deep Contractive Autoencoder for O-RAN Traffic Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have become integral part in advancing next generation wireless communication systems by enabling sophisticated data modeling and feature extraction for enhanced network performance. In the realm of open radio access networks (O-RAN), characterized by their disaggregated architecture and heterogeneous components from multiple vendors, the deployment of generative models offers significant advantages for network management such as traffic analysis, traffic forecasting and anomaly detection. However, the complex and dynamic nature of O-RAN introduces challenges that necessitate not only accurate detection mechanisms but also reduced complexity, scalability, and most importantly interpretability to facilitate effective network management. In this study, we introduce the XAInomaly framework, an explainable and interpretable Semi-supervised (SS) Deep Contractive Autoencoder (DeepCAE) design for anomaly detection in O-RAN. Our approach leverages the generative modeling capabilities of our SS-DeepCAE model to learn compressed, robust representations of normal network behavior, which captures essential features, enabling the identification of deviations indicative of anomalies. To address the black-box nature of deep learning models, we propose reactive Explainable AI (XAI) technique called fastshap-C.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Based Meta-Learning for Fast mmWave Beam Prediction in Non-Stationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning techniques have achieved great success in improving data-rate performance and reducing latency in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. However, these methods still face two key challenges: (i) their reliance on large-scale paired data for model training and tuning which limits performance gains and makes beam predictions outdated, especially in multi-user mmWave systems with large antenna arrays, and (ii) meta-learning (ML)-based beamforming solutions are prone to overfitting when trained on a limited number of tasks. To address these issues, we propose a memristorbased meta-learning (M-ML) framework for predicting mmWave beam in real time. The M-ML framework generates optimal initialization parameters during the training phase, providing a strong starting point for adapting to unknown environments during the testing phase. By leveraging memory to store key data, M-ML ensures the predicted beamforming vectors are wellsuited to episodically dynamic channel distributions, even when testing and training environments do not align. Simulation results show that our approach delivers high prediction accuracy in new environments, without relying on large datasets. Moreover, MML enhances the model's generalization ability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Topological Interference Management: A Learning-to-Code on Graphs Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advance of topological interference management (TIM) has been one of the driving forces of recent developments in network information theory. However, state-of-the-art coding schemes for TIM are usually handcrafted for specific families of network topologies, relying critically on experts' domain knowledge and sophisticated treatments. The lack of systematic and automatic generation of solutions inevitably restricts their potential wider applications to wireless communication systems, due to the limited generalizability of coding schemes to wider network configurations. To address such an issue, this work makes the first attempt to advocate revisiting topological interference alignment (IA) from a novel learning-to-code perspective. Specifically, we recast the one-to-one and subspace IA conditions as vector assignment policies and propose a unifying learning-to-code on graphs (LCG) framework by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) for capturing topological structures and reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making of IA beamforming vector assignment. Interestingly, the proposed LCG framework is capable of recovering known one-to-one scalar/vector IA solutions for a significantly wider range of network topologies, and more remarkably of discovering new subspace IA coding schemes for multiple-antenna cases that are challenging to be handcrafted. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the LCG framework is an effective way to automatically produce systematic coding solutions to the TIM instances with arbitrary network topologies, and at the same time, the underlying learning algorithm is efficient with respect to online inference time and possesses excellent generalizability and transferability for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Optimal Microcontroller Usage in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Batteryless IoT Systems Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance wireless communication in IoT systems using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), efficient control of programmable passive and active elements is essential. However, increasing RIS elements requires more microcontrollers, raising complexity and cost. This paper proposes a modular approach ("Module"), where each microcontroller controls a module of optimal active or passive elements. The module size is determined using a non-linear energy harvesting model, where a batteryless IoT (b-IoT) sensor harvests energy from base station (BS) RF signals. We optimize the number of modules (microcontrollers) to minimize energy consumption while satisfying energy harvesting and information causality constraints. Simulations show that RIS module-assisted energy harvesting improves IoT system performance by ~100% compared to models without RIS panels.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for Reconstruction of Random Hypergraphs From Graph Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph projection of a hypergraph is a simple graph with the same vertex set and with an edge between each pair of vertices that appear in a hyperedge. We consider the problem of reconstructing a random $d$-uniform hypergraph from its projection. Feasibility of this task depends on $d$ and the density of hyperedges in the random hypergraph. For $d=3$ we precisely determine the threshold, while for $d\geq 4$ we give bounds. All of our feasibility results are obtained by exhibiting an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the original hypergraph, while infeasibility is information-theoretic.
  Our results also apply to mildly inhomogeneous random hypergrahps, including hypergraph stochastic block models (HSBM). A consequence of our results is an optimal HSBM recovery algorithm, improving on a result of Guadio and Joshi in 2023.</description>

      <title>Criteria-Aware Graph Filtering: Extremely Fast Yet Accurate Multi-Criteria Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-criteria (MC) recommender systems, which utilize MC rating information for recommendation, are increasingly widespread in various e-commerce domains. However, the MC recommendation using training-based collaborative filtering, requiring consideration of multiple ratings compared to single-criterion counterparts, often poses practical challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance along with scalable model training. To solve this problem, we propose CA-GF, a training-free MC recommendation method, which is built upon criteria-aware graph filtering for efficient yet accurate MC recommendations. Specifically, first, we construct an item-item similarity graph using an MC user-expansion graph. Next, we design CA-GF composed of the following key components, including 1) criterion-specific graph filtering where the optimal filter for each criterion is found using various types of polynomial low-pass filters and 2) criteria preference-infused aggregation where the smoothed signals from each criterion are aggregated. We demonstrate that CA-GF is (a) efficient: providing the computational efficiency, offering the extremely fast runtime of less than 0.2 seconds even on the largest benchmark dataset, (b) accurate: outperforming benchmark MC recommendation methods, achieving substantial accuracy gains up to 24% compared to the best competitor, and (c) interpretable: providing interpretations for the contribution of each criterion to the model prediction based on visualizations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Member-Group Relations via Multi-View Graph Filtering for Effective Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group recommendation aims at providing optimized recommendations tailored to diverse groups, enabling groups to enjoy appropriate items. On the other hand, most existing group recommendation methods are built upon deep neural network (DNN) architectures designed to capture the intricate relationships between member-level and group-level interactions. While these DNN-based approaches have proven their effectiveness, they require complex and expensive training procedures to incorporate group-level interactions in addition to member-level interactions. To overcome such limitations, we introduce Group-GF, a new approach for extremely fast recommendations of items to each group via multi-view graph filtering (GF) that offers a holistic view of complex member-group dynamics, without the need for costly model training. Specifically, in Group-GF, we first construct three item similarity graphs manifesting different viewpoints for GF. Then, we discover a distinct polynomial graph filter for each similarity graph and judiciously aggregate the three graph filters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Group-GF in terms of significantly reducing runtime and achieving state-of-the-art recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technology for fast wireless data aggregation by harnessing the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. This paper investigates a fluid antenna (FA) array-enhanced AirComp system, employing the new degrees of freedom achieved by antenna movements. Specifically, we jointly optimize the transceiver design and antenna position vector (APV) to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between target and estimated function values. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex problem, we adopt an alternating optimization technique to decompose it into three subproblems. These subproblems are then iteratively solved until convergence, leading to a locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that FA arrays with the proposed transceiver and APV design significantly outperform the traditional fixed-position antenna arrays in terms of MSE.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Compress-and-Forward Schemes for the Relay Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relay channel, consisting of a source-destination pair along with a relay, is a fundamental component of cooperative communications. While the capacity of a general relay channel remains unknown, various relaying strategies, including compress-and-forward (CF), have been proposed. In CF, the relay forwards a quantized version of its received signal to the destination. Given the correlated signals at the relay and destination, distributed compression techniques, such as Wyner--Ziv coding, can be harnessed to utilize the relay-to-destination link more efficiently. Leveraging recent advances in neural network-based distributed compression, we revisit the relay channel problem and integrate a learned task-aware Wyner--Ziv compressor into a primitive relay channel with a finite-capacity out-of-band relay-to-destination link. The resulting neural CF scheme demonstrates that our compressor recovers binning of the quantized indices at the relay, mimicking the optimal asymptotic CF strategy, although no structure exploiting the knowledge of source statistics was imposed into the design. The proposed neural CF, employing finite order modulation, operates closely to the rate achievable in a primitive relay channel with a Gaussian codebook. We showcase the advantages of exploiting the correlated destination signal for relay compression through various neural CF architectures that involve end-to-end training of the compressor and the demodulator components. Our learned task-oriented compressors provide the first proof-of-concept work toward interpretable and practical neural CF relaying schemes.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. Power efficiency is achieved through holographic beamforming in a DMA-aided network, minimizing total transmission power while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMA require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wave-domain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. In this setup, the beamforming performance of DMA-aided precoding is analyzed in comparison to its optimal limits and traditional fully digital (FD) architectures, considering the effects of the Lorentzian constraints of metasurfaces and the degree of freedom (DoF) limitations due to a reduced number of RF chains. We demonstrate that the performance gap caused by DoF constraints becomes more significant as the number of users increases, highlighting the trade-offs of DMA in high-density wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction for the Single-Deletion Single-Substitution Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03833v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central problem in sequence reconstruction is to find the minimum number of distinct channel outputs required to uniquely reconstruct the transmitted sequence. According to Levenshtein's work in 2001, this number is determined by the size of the maximum intersection between the error balls of any two distinct input sequences of the channel. In this work, we study the sequence reconstruction problem for single-deletion single-substitution channel, assuming that the transmitted sequence belongs to a $q$-ary code with minimum Hamming distance at least $2$, where $q\geq 2$ is any fixed integer. Specifically, we prove that for any two $q$-ary sequences of length $n$ and with Hamming distance $d\geq 2$, the size of the intersection of their error balls is upper bounded by $2qn-3q-2-\delta_{q,2}$, where $\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta. We also prove the tightness of this bound by constructing two sequences the intersection size of whose error balls achieves this bound.</description>

      <title>Next-Gen Space-Based Surveillance: Blockchain for Trusted and Efficient Debris Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel blockchain-enabled architecture for efficient decentralized space surveillance. Our simulation results indicate that a network under 30 nodes achieves optimal throughput and response time. We also compare our architecture with a fully participatory consensus model, where all nodes perform both verification and approval tasks. Across all scenarios, our approach demonstrates a 9x improvement in both throughput and response time compared to the full participatory consensus, highlighting the efficiency gains achieved by assigning dedicated roles for verification and approval. Future work will explore the impact of faulty nodes and potential security threats on network performance.</description>

      <title>Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous Decoding Approach to Joint State and Message Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity-distortion (C-D) trade-offs for joint state and message communications (JSMC) over single- and multi-user channels are investigated, where the transmitters have access to generalized state information and feedback while the receivers jointly decode the messages and estimate the channel state. A coding scheme is proposed based on backward simultaneous decoding of messages and compressed state descriptions without the need for the Wyner-Ziv random binning technique. For the point-to-point channel, the proposed scheme results in the optimal C-D function. For the state-dependent discrete memoryless degraded broadcast channel (SD-DMDBC), the successive refinement method is adopted for designing multi-stage state descriptions. With the simultaneous decoding approach, the derived achievable region is shown to be larger than the region obtained by the sequential decoding approach that is utilized in existing works. As for the state-dependent discrete memoryless multiple access channel (SD-DMMAC), in addition to the proposed method, Willem's coding strategy is applied to enable partial collaboration between transmitters through the feedback links. Moreover, the state descriptions are shown to enhance both communication and state estimation performance. Examples are provided for the derived results to verify the analysis, either numerically or analytically. With particular focus, simple but representative integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems are also considered, and their fundamental performance limits are studied.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agents for Radio Map Generation and Wireless Network Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using commercial software for radio map generation and wireless network planning often require complex manual operations, posing significant challenges in terms of scalability, adaptability, and user-friendliness, due to heavy manual operations. To address these issues, we propose an automated solution that employs large language model (LLM) agents. These agents are designed to autonomously generate radio maps and facilitate wireless network planning for specified areas, thereby minimizing the necessity for extensive manual intervention. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed solution, we develop a software platform that integrates LLM agents. Experimental results demonstrate that a large amount manual operations can be saved via the proposed LLM agent, and the automated solutions can achieve an enhanced coverage and signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), especially in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Private Multiple Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For multiple hypothesis testing based on classical data samples, we demonstrate a quantum advantage in the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT), where the privacy and utility measures are set to (quantum) local differential privacy and the pairwise-minimum Chernoff information, respectively. To show the quantum advantage, we consider some class of hypotheses that we coin smoothed point masses. For such hypotheses, we derive an upper bound of the optimal PUT achieved by classical mechanisms, which is tight for some cases, and propose a certain quantum mechanism which achieves a better PUT than the upper bound. The proposed quantum mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel whose outputs are pure states corresponding to a symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM), and a depolarizing channel.</description>
