      <title>Explicit Representatives and Sizes of Cyclotomic Cosets and their Application to Cyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclotomic coset is a basic notion which has wide application in various computation problems. Let $q$ be a prime power, and $n$ be a positive integer coprime to $q$. In this paper we determine explicitly the representatives and the sizes of all $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ in the general settings. Instead of the $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo a fixed integer, we consider the profinite spaces of compatible sequences of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $2^{N}n^{\prime}$ for $N \geq 0$, where $n^{\prime}$ is the maximal odd divisor of $n$, with a fixed leader component. We give precise characterization of the structure of these profinite spaces, which reveals the general formula for representatives of cyclotomic cosets. As applications, we determine the generator polynomials of all cyclic codes over finite fields, and further enumerate and depict the self-dual cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Elementary Constructions of Best Known Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many good quantum codes over various finite fields $F_q$ have been constructed from codes over extension rings or mixed alphabet rings via some version of a Gray map. We show that most of these codes can be obtained more directly from cyclic codes or their generalizations over $F_q$. Unless explicit benefits are demonstrated for the indirect approach, we believe that direct and more elementary methods should be preferred.</description>

      <title>Joint Data Compression, Secure Multi-Part Collaborative Task Offloading and Resource Assignment in Ultra-Dense Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance resource utilization and address interference issues in ultra-dense networks with mobile edge computing (MEC), a resource utilization approach is first introduced, which integrates orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Then, to minimize the energy consumed by ultra-densely deployed small base stations (SBSs) while ensuring proportional assignment of computational resources and the constraints related to processing delay and security breach cost, the joint optimization of channel selection, the number of subchannels, secure service assignment, multi-step computation offloading, device association, data compression (DC) control, power control, and frequency band partitioning is done for minimizing network-wide energy consumption (EC). Given that the current problem is nonlinear and involves integral optimization parameters, we have devised an adaptive genetic water wave optimization (AGWWO) algorithm by improving the traditional water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm using genetic operations. After that, the computational complexity, convergence, and parallel implementation of AGWWO algorithm are analyzed. Simulation results reveal that this algorithm effectively reduces network-wide EC while guaranteeing the constraints of processing delay and security breach cost.</description>

      <title>Transmission Scheduling of Millimeter Wave Communication for High-Speed Railway in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) greatly improves coverage and reliability for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. However, a significant challenge arises in the transmission scheduling due to the rapid changes in channel state, link selection for train mobile relays (MRs), and order of the flow scheduling. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an optimization problem focused on maximizing the weighted sum completed flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements for HSR mmWave communication in SAGIN. To facilitate the simultaneous scheduling of flows by base station-MR (BS-MR), satellite-airship-MR, and satellite-MR links, we propose a link selection algorithm, which can help each flow choose a suitable set of links in every frame and determine whether the BS networks need the assistance of the satellite and airship. Furthermore, taking into account the priority and occupied time slots (TSs) resource of different flows, we propose a multi-link weighted flow scheduling (MWFS) algorithm. This algorithm not only prioritizes scheduling high-priority flows but also aims to maximize the weighted sum completed flows for MRs. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the weighted sum completed flows and the total transmitted bits. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal flow transmission in different link switching periods and enhance the scheduling of high-priority flows compared to other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Multi-Task Semantic Communications Systems over Relay Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task, multi-link relay semantic communications (MTML-RSC) scheme that enables the destination node to simultaneously perform image reconstruction and classification with one transmission from the source node. In the MTML-RSC scheme, the source node broadcasts a signal using semantic communications, and the relay node forwards the signal to the destination. We analyze the coupling relationship between the two tasks and the two links (source-to-relay and source-to-destination) and design a semantic-focused forward method for the relay node, where it selectively forwards only the semantics of the relevant class while ignoring others. At the destination, the node combines signals from both the source node and the relay node to perform classification, and then uses the classification result to assist in decoding the signal from the relay node for image reconstructing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MTML-RSC scheme achieves significant performance gains, e.g., $1.73$ dB improvement in peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for image reconstruction and increasing the accuracy from $64.89\%$ to $70.31\%$ for classification.</description>

      <title>Selfdual skew cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite extension $K/F$ of degree $r$ of a finite field $F$, we enumerate all selfdual skew cyclic codes in the Ore quotient ring $K[X;\text{Frob}]/(X^{rk}-1)$ for any positive integer $k$ coprime to the characteristic $p$ (separable case). We also provide an enumeration algorithm when $k$ is a power of $p$ (purely inseparable case), at the cost of some redundancies. Our approach is based on an explicit bijection between skew cyclic codes, on the one hand, and certain families of $F$-linear subspaces of some extensions of $K$. Finally, we report on an implementation in SageMath.</description>

      <title>Sensing-assisted Near-field Energy Beam Focusing with ELAA Over Non-stationary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a novel training-free energy beam focusing approach for a near-field wireless power transfer (WPT) system with extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA). In particular, we focus on the setup with one access point (AP) equipped with an extremely large-scale uniform planar array (UPA) serving multiple single-antenna energy receivers (ERs), in which the line-of-sight (LoS) dominated wireless channels are dependent on the relative positions of ERs and exhibit spatial non-stationarity. Different from conventional designs relying on training and feedback, we present a novel energy beam focusing design assisted by wireless radar sensing based on a two-stage transmission protocol. In the first stage, the AP performs wireless radar sensing to identify the ERs' visibility regions (VRs) and estimate their three-dimension (3D) positions for constructing the corresponding channel state information (CSI). In the second stage, the AP implements the transmit energy beam focusing based on the constructed CSI to efficiently charge these ERs. Under this setup, we first minimize the sensing duration in the first stage, while guaranteeing a specific accuracy threshold for position estimation. Next, we optimize the energy beamformers at the AP in the second stage to maximize the weighted harvested energy among all ERs subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. In this approach, the time resource allocation between the two stages is properly designed to optimize the ultimate energy transfer performance. Numerical results show that the proposed design performs close to the performance upper bound with perfect VR and CSI and significantly outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic Analysis of the Gibbs Algorithm: An Individual Sample Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress has shown that the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm can be exactly characterized using the symmetrized KL information between the learned hypothesis and the entire training dataset. However, evaluating such a characterization is cumbersome, as it involves a high-dimensional information measure. In this paper, we address this issue by considering individual sample information measures within the Gibbs algorithm. Our main contribution lies in establishing the asymptotic equivalence between the sum of symmetrized KL information between the output hypothesis and individual samples and that between the hypothesis and the entire dataset. We prove this by providing explicit expressions for the gap between these measures in the non-asymptotic regime. Additionally, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of various information measures in the context of the Gibbs algorithm, leading to tighter generalization error bounds. An illustrative example is provided to verify our theoretical results, demonstrating our analysis holds in broader settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively study weighted projective Reed-Muller (WPRM) codes on weighted projective planes $\mathbb{P}(1,a,b)$. We provide the universal Gr\"obner basis for the vanishing ideal of the set $Y$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$--rational points of $\mathbb{P}(1,a,b)$ to get the dimension of the code. We determine the regularity set of $Y$ using a novel combinatorial approach. We employ footprint techniques to compute the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-probability Method and Applications for Trace Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the trace reconstruction problem, one attempts to reconstruct a fixed but unknown string $x$ of length $n$ from a given number of traces $\tilde{x}$ drawn iid from the application of a noisy process (such as the deletion channel) to $x$. The best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction from the deletion channel is due to Chase, and recovers the input string whp given $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/5}))$ traces [Cha21b].
  The main component in Chase's algorithm is a procedure for k-mer estimation, which, for any marker $w$ in $\{0, 1\}^k$ of length $k$, computes a "smoothed" distribution of its appearances in the input string $x$ [CGL+23, MS24]. Current k-mer estimation algorithms fail when the deletion probability is above $1/2$, requiring a more complex analysis for Chase's algorithm. Moreover, the only known extension of these approaches beyond the deletion channels is based on numerically estimating high-order differentials of a multivariate polynomial, making it highly impractical [Rub23].
  In this paper, we construct a simple Monte Carlo method for k-mer estimation which can be easily applied to a much wider variety of channels. In particular, we solve k-mer estimation for any combination of insertion, deletion, and bit-flip channels, even in the high deletion probability regime, allowing us to directly apply Chase's algorithm for this wider class of channels.
  To accomplish this, we utilize an approach from the field of quantum error mitigation (the process of using many measurements from noisy quantum computers to simulate a clean quantum computer), called the quasi-probability method (also known as probabilistic error cancellation) [TBG17, PSW22]. We derive a completely classical version of this technique, and use it to construct a k-mer estimation algorithm.
  No background in quantum computing is needed to understand this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a sum-rank saturating system and outline its correspondence to a covering properties of a sum-rank metric code. We consider the problem of determining the shortest sum-rank-$\rho$-saturating systems of a fixed dimension, which is equivalent to the covering problem in the sum-rank metric. We obtain upper and lower bounds on this quantity. We also give constructions of saturating systems arising from geometrical structures.</description>

      <title>On the sample complexity of purity and inner product estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the prototypical tasks quantum purity estimation and quantum inner product estimation. In purity estimation, we are to estimate $tr(\rho^2)$ of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ to additive error $\epsilon$. Meanwhile, for quantum inner product estimation, Alice and Bob are to estimate $tr(\rho\sigma)$ to additive error $\epsilon$ given copies of unknown quantum state $\rho$ and $\sigma$ using classical communication and restricted quantum communication.
  In this paper, we show a strong connection between the sample complexity of purity estimation with bounded quantum memory and inner product estimation with bounded quantum communication and unentangled measurements. We propose a protocol that solves quantum inner product estimation with $k$-qubit one-way quantum communication and unentangled local measurements using $O(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon,2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Our protocol can be modified to estimate the purity of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ using $k$-qubit quantum memory with the same complexity. We prove that arbitrary protocols with $k$-qubit quantum memory that estimate purity to error $\epsilon$ require $\Omega(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\sqrt{\epsilon},2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$. This indicates the same lower bound for quantum inner product estimation with one-way $k$-qubit quantum communication and classical communication, and unentangled local measurements. For purity estimation, we further improve the lower bound to $\Omega(\max\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon\})$ for any protocols using an identical single-copy projection-valued measurement.
  Additionally, we investigate a decisional variant of quantum distributed inner product estimation without quantum communication for mixed state and provide a lower bound on the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Duality of Alternating Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize the half-steps of a general class of Markov chains as alternating projections with respect to the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sets of joint probability distributions which admit an information geometrical property known as autoparallelism. We exhibit both a weak and strong duality between the Markov chains defined by the even and odd half-steps of the alternating projection scheme, which manifests as an equivalence of entropy decay statement regarding the chains, with a precise characterization of the entropy decrease at each half-step. We apply this duality to several Markov chains of interest, and obtain either new results or short, alternative proofs for mixing bounds on the dual chain, with the Swendsen-Wang dynamics serving as a key example. Additionally, we draw parallels between the half-steps of the relevant Markov chains and the Sinkhorn algorithm from the field of entropically regularized optimal transport, which are unified by the perspective of alternating projections with respect to an \alpha-divergence on the probability simplex.</description>

      <title>Repetition and recurrence times: Dual statements and short memory conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By an analogy to the duality between the recurrence time and the longest match length, we introduce a quantity dual to the maximal repetition length, which we call the repetition time. Extending prior results, we sandwich the repetition time in terms of unconditional and conditional min-entropies. The condition for the upper bound resembles short memory in the sense developed in time series analysis. Our reasonings make a repeated use of dualities between so called times and so called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length. We also discuss the analogy of these results with the Wyner-Ziv/Ornstein-Weiss theorem, which sandwiches the recurrence time in terms of Shannon entropies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks with the aim of effectively balancing sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Focusing on monostatic sensing, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which facilitates us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize key network-level parameters. Based on the derived tractable expression of area spectral efficiency (ASE), we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the network performance from the view point of two joint S&amp;C metrics. Towards this end, we further jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes for S&amp;C and the serving/probing numbers of users/targets to achieve a flexible tradeoff between S&amp;C at the network level. It is verified that interference nulling can effectively improve the average data rate and radar information rate. Surprisingly, the optimal communication tradeoff for the case of the ASE maximization tends to employ all spacial resources towards multiplexing and diversity gain, without interference nulling. By contrast, for the sensing objectives, resource allocation tends to eliminate certain interference especially when the antenna resources are sufficient, because the inter-cell interference becomes a more dominant factor affecting sensing performance. Furthermore, we prove that the ratio of the optimal number of users and the number of transmit antennas is a constant value when the communication performance is optimal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme achieves a substantial gain in S&amp;C performance at the network level.</description>

      <title>Wireless 6G Connectivity for Massive Number of Devices and Critical Services</title>

Abstract: Compared to the generations up to 4G, whose main focus was on broadband and coverage aspects, 5G has expanded the scope of wireless cellular systems towards embracing two new types of connectivity: massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). This paper will discuss the possible evolution of these two types of connectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. The paper consists of three parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of devices. While mMTC research in 5G was predominantly focused on the problem of uncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic patterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive connectivity. One of the drivers for this is distributed learning/inference. The second part of the paper will discuss the evolution of wireless connectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly coupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety critical control applications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the emergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value. Additionally, ensuring ultra-high reliability for safety critical control applications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the wireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent requirements calls for the development of novel AI-based techniques, incorporating optimization theory, explainable AI, generative AI and digital twins. The third part will analyze the coexistence of massive connectivity and critical services. We will consider scenarios in which a massive number of devices need to support traffic patterns of mixed criticality. This will be followed by a discussion about the management of wireless resources shared by services with different criticality.</description>

      <title>The second-order zero differential uniformity of the swapped inverse functions over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16784</link>

Abstract: The Feistel Boomerang Connectivity Table (FBCT) was proposed as the feistel counterpart of the Boomerang Connectivity Table. The entries of the FBCT are actually related to the second-order zero differential spectrum. Recently, several results on the second-order zero differential uniformity of some functions were introduced. However, almost all of them were focused on power functions, and there are only few results on non-power functions. In this paper, we investigate the second-order zero differential uniformity of the swapped inverse functions, which are functions obtained from swapping two points in the inverse function. We also present the second-order zero differential spectrum of the swapped inverse functions for certain cases. In particular, this paper is the first result to characterize classes of non-power functions with the second-order zero differential uniformity equal to 4, in even characteristic.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Compute-Optimal Size Scaling, Emergence, and Plateaus in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent empirical studies show three phenomena with increasing size of language models: compute-optimal size scaling, emergent capabilities, and performance plateauing. We present a simple unified mathematical framework to explain all of these language model scaling phenomena, building on recent skill-text bipartite graph frameworks for semantic learning. Modeling the learning of concepts from texts as an iterative process yields an analogy to iterative decoding of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in information theory. Thence, drawing on finite-size scaling characterizations of LDPC decoding, we derive the compute-optimal size scaling (Chinchilla rule) for language models. Further, using tools from random network theory, we provide a simple explanation for both emergence of complex skills and plateauing of performance as the size of language models scale. We see multiple plateaus.</description>

      <title>Evolving privacy: drift parameter estimation for discretely observed i.i.d. diffusion processes under LDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating a parameter in the drift coefficient is addressed for $N$ discretely observed independent and identically distributed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). This is done considering additional constraints, wherein only public data can be published and used for inference. The concept of local differential privacy (LDP) is formally introduced for a system of stochastic differential equations. The objective is to estimate the drift parameter by proposing a contrast function based on a pseudo-likelihood approach. A suitably scaled Laplace noise is incorporated to meet the privacy requirements. Our key findings encompass the derivation of explicit conditions tied to the privacy level. Under these conditions, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the associated estimator. Notably, the convergence rate is intricately linked to the privacy level, and is some situations may be completely different from the case where privacy constraints are ignored. Our results hold true as the discretization step approaches zero and the number of processes $N$ tends to infinity.</description>
