      <title>High-contrast absorption magnetometry in the visible to near-infrared range with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has so far been measured via emission of light from NV centers or via absorption at the singlet transition at 1042 nm. Here, we demonstrate a phenomenon of broadband optical absorption by the NV centers starting in the emission wavelength and reaching up to 1000 nm. The measurements are enabled by a high-finesse cavity, which is used for room temperature continuous wave pump-probe experiments. The red to infrared probe beam shows the typical optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signal of the NV spin with contrasts up to 42 %. This broadband optical absorption is not yet reported in terms of NV magnetometry. We argue that the lower level of the absorbing transition could be the energetically lower NV singlet state, based on the increased optical absorption for a resonant microwave field and the spectral behavior. Investigations of the photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity show improvements with increasing probe wavelength, reaching an optimum of 7.5 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The results show significantly improved ODMR contrast compared to emission-based magnetometry. This opens a new detection wavelength regime with coherent laser signal detection for high-sensitivity NV magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Integrated probabilistic computer using voltage-controlled magnetic tunnel junctions as its entropy source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs) provide a path to solving many computationally hard problems more efficiently than deterministic algorithms on von Neumann computers. Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (S-MTJs), which are engineered to be thermally unstable, show promise as entropy sources in PIMs. However, scaling up S-MTJ-PIMs is challenging, as it requires fine control of a small magnetic energy barrier across large numbers of devices. In addition, non-spintronic components of S-MTJ-PIMs to date have been primarily realized using general-purpose processors or field-programmable gate arrays. Reaching the ultimate performance of spintronic PIMs, however, requires co-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), combining CMOS with spintronic entropy sources. Here we demonstrate an ASIC in 130 nm foundry CMOS, which implements integer factorization as a representative hard optimization problem, using PIM-based invertible logic gates realized with 1143 probabilistic bits. The ASIC uses stochastic bit sequences read from an adjacent voltage-controlled (V-) MTJ chip. The V-MTJs are designed to be thermally stable in the absence of voltage, and generate random bits on-demand in response to 10 ns pulses using the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect. We experimentally demonstrate the chip's functionality and provide projections for designs in advanced nodes, illustrating a path to millions of probabilistic bits on a single CMOS+V-MTJ chip.</description>

      <title>YIG/CoFeB bilayer magnonic diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a magnonic diode based on a bilayer structure of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and Cobalt Iron Boron (CoFeB). The bilayer exhibits pronounced non-reciprocal spin-wave propagation, enabled by dipolar coupling and the magnetic properties of the two layers. The YIG layer provides low damping and efficient spin-wave propagation, while the CoFeB layer introduces strong magnetic anisotropy, critical for achieving diode functionality. Experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, show unidirectional propagation of Magnetostatic Surface Spin Waves (MSSW), significantly suppressing backscattered waves. This behavior was confirmed through wavevector-resolved and micro-focused Brillouin Light Scattering measurements and is supported by numerical simulations. The proposed YIG/SiO$_2$/CoFeB bilayer magnonic diode demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging non-reciprocal spin-wave dynamics for functional magnonic devices, paving the way for energy-efficient, wave-based signal processing technologies.</description>

      <title>A nonreciprocal and tunable active acoustic scatterer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A passive loudspeaker mounted in a duct acts as a reciprocal scatterer for plane waves impinging on either of its sides. However, the reciprocity can be broken by means of an asymmetric electroacoustic feedback which supplies to the loudspeaker a signal picked-up from a microphone facing only one of its sides. This simple modification offers new opportunities for the control and manipulation of sound waves. In this paper, we investigate the scattering features of a pair of such actively controlled loudspeakers connected by means of a short and narrow duct. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that by tuning the feedback loops, the system exhibits several exotic effects, which include an asymmetric reflectionless configuration with one-way transmission or absorption, a directional amplifier with an isolation of 42 dB, and a quasi CPA-lasing configuration. All of these effects were achieved using a single setup in the subwavelength regime, highlighting the versatility of such an asymmetrically active scatterer.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Coupling Breaks Energy Symmetry in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and ionic liquids to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the electronic and energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct, stable states, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight a compelling method to control charge carrier dynamics via the electrolyte, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized tool for enabling novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Colossal terahertz emission with ultrafast tunability based on van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology is critical for quantum material physics, biomedical imaging, ultrafast electronics, and next-generation wireless communications. However, standing in the way of widespread applications is the scarcity of efficient ultrafast THz sources with on-demand fast modulation and easy on-chip integration capability. Here we report the discovery of colossal THz emission from a van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI$_2$. Using THz emission spectroscopy, we observe a THz generation efficiency an order of magnitude higher than that of ZnTe, a standard nonlinear crystal for ultrafast THz generation. We further uncover the underlying generation mechanisms associated with its large ferroelectric polarization by studying the THz emission dependence on excitation wavelength, incident polarization and fluence. Moreover, we demonstrate the ultrafast coherent amplification and annihilation of the THz emission and associated coherent phonon oscillations by employing a double-pump scheme. These findings combined with first-principles calculations, inform new understanding of the THz light-matter interaction in emergent vdW ferroelectrics and pave the way to develop high-performance THz devices on them for quantum materials sensing and ultrafast electronics.</description>

      <title>Sensitive optical coating defect detection via second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical coating, an integral part of many optical systems, is prone to damage from environmental exposure and laser irradiation. This underscores the need for reliable and sensitive coating diagnostics. We introduce second harmonic generation (SHG) as a method for the sensitive detection of defects and inhomogeneities within optical thin films. We demonstrate the use of SHG on Si3N4 layers tested for their laser-induced damage threshold. The SHG mapping was compared with commonly used diagnostic techniques, including Nomarski microscopy, white light interferometry, and electron microscopy. Owing to its sensitivity to variations in local symmetry, SHG is able to discern minute alterations in material composition, mechanical stress, and interface structures. Therefore, SHG identified modifications in the tested layers, highly extending the damage recognized by standard methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SHG's ability to enhance specific features by modulation of incidence angles and polarization modes. Based on these findings, we propose SHG as an ideal diagnostic tool for the early identification of laser-induced modifications in centrosymmetric thin films.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Strong Orbital Moments in Perpendicularly Magnetized Magnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balance between the orbital and spin magnetic moments in a magnetic system is the heart of many intriguing phenomena. Here, we show experimental evidence of a large orbital moment, which competes with its spin counterpart in a ferrimagnetic insulator thulium iron garnet, Tm3Fe5O12. Leveraging element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), we establish that the dominant contribution to the orbital moment originates from 4f orbitals of Tm. Besides the large Tm orbital moment, intriguingly, our results also reveal a smaller but evident non-zero XMCD signal in the O K edge, suggesting additional spin-orbit coupling and exchange interactions with the nearest neighbour Fe atoms. The unquenched orbital moment is primarily responsible for a significant reduction in g-factor, typically 2 in transition metals, as determined independently using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings reveal a non-linear reduction in the g-factor from 1.7 at 300 K to 1.56 at 200 K in Tm3Fe5O12 thin films. These results provide critical insights into the role of the f orbitals in long-range magnetic order and stimulate further exploration in orbitronics.</description>

      <title>High-temperature Phonon Coherence and Tunneling Effect in Semiconductor Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons, the quanta of lattice vibrations, are primary heat carriers for semiconductors and dielectrics. The demand of effective phonon manipulation urgently emerges, because the thermal management is crucial for the ongoing development of micro/nano semiconductor devices towards higher integration and power densities1, 2. Phonons also show wave-particle duality, while they are commonly treated as particle flows in current semiconductor structures3, 4. However, it sees constraints when the structure size reduces to nano and atomic scales, where the wave behavior of phonons begins to dominate, and studies of these phonon behaviors and their manipulations become long-standing challenges in experiments5. Here we show the experimental realization of coherent phonon transport, a wave-based thermal conduction fashion, in semiconductor structures. We report the successful observation of robust phonon coherence and tunneling effect in InAs/AlAs superlattices over an extensive temperature range up to 500 K, a breakthrough towards practical-application temperature for semiconductors compared with cryogenic conditions6. Our results demonstrate that the phonon coherence is robust even at a record-high interface density due to the dominating long-wavelength phonons, and the first-principles calculations clearly reveal their wave-particle duality. This revelation heralds a promising pathway towards efficient thermal phonon engineering at extreme scales, holding implications for a broad spectrum of semiconductor device applications, including microelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Transient States to Control the Electromagnetic Response of Space-time Dispersive Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamic formation of transients when plane waves impinge on a dispersive slab that abruptly changes its electrical properties in time. The time-varying slab alternates between air and metal-like states, whose frequency dispersion is described by the Drude model. It is shown how the physics of this complex system can be well described with the joint combination of two terms: one associated with temporal refractions and the other associated with spatial refractions. To test the validity of the approach, some analytical results are compared with a self-implemented finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Results show how the transients that occurred after the abrupt temporal changes can shape the overall steady-state response of the space-time system. In fact, far from always being detrimental, these transient states can be conveniently used to perform frequency conversion or to amplify/attenuate the electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous push for high-performance photonic switches is one of the most crucial premises for the sustainable scaling of programmable and reconfigurable photonic circuits for a wide spectrum of applications. Conventional optical switches rely on the perturbative mechanisms of mode coupling or mode interference, resulting in inherent bottlenecks in their switching performance concerning size, power consumption and bandwidth. Here we propose and realize a silicon photonic 2x2 elementary switch based on a split waveguide crossing (SWX) consisting of two halves. The propagation direction of the incident light is manipulated to implement the OFF/ON states by splitting/combining the two halves of the SWX, showing excellent performance with low excess loss and low crosstalk over an ultrawide bandwidth. Both elementary switch and a 64x64 switch array based on Benes topology are fabricated and characterized, demonstrating great potential for practical scenarios such as photonic interconnect/routing, Lidar and spectroscopy, photonic computing, as well as microwave photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical information processing and computing can potentially offer enhanced performance, scalability and energy efficiency. However, achieving nonlinearity-a critical component of computation-remains challenging in the optical domain. Here we introduce a design that leverages a multiple-scattering cavity to passively induce optical nonlinear random mapping with a continuous-wave laser at a low power. Each scattering event effectively mixes information from different areas of a spatial light modulator, resulting in a highly nonlinear mapping between the input data and output pattern. We demonstrate that our design retains vital information even when the readout dimensionality is reduced, thereby enabling optical data compression. This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in both the linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Van den Broeck limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

Abstract: Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.</description>
