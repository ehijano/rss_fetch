      <title>On Isbell's Density Theorem for bitopological pointfree spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of studying subspaces in pointfree bitopology, we characterize extremal epimorphism in biframes and show that a smallest dense one always exists, providing an analogue of Isbell's Density Theorem. Further we study the functoriality of assigning to each biframe its lattice of subbilocales and its smallest dense subbilocale.</description>

      <title>The Quillen negation monoid of a category, and Schreier graphs of its action on classes of morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free monoid with two generators acts on classes (=properties) of morphisms of a category by taking the left or right orthogonal complement with respect to the lifting property, and we define the Quillen negation monoid of the category to be its largest quotient which acts faithfully. We consider the category of topological spaces and show that a number of natural properties of continuous maps are obtained by applying this action to a single example.
  Namely, for the category of topological spaces we show finiteness of the orbit of the simplest class of morphisms { \emptyset \to {*} }, and we calculate its Schreier graph. The orbit consists of 21 classes of morphisms, and most of these classes are explicitly defined by standard terminology from a typical first year course of topology: a map having a section or dense image; quotient and induced topology; surjective, injective; (maps representing) subsets, closed subsets; disjoint union, disjoint union with a discrete space; each fibre satisfying separation axiom T0 or T1 . Also, the notions of being connected, having a generic point, and being a complete lattice, can be defined in terms of the classes in the orbit.
  In particular, calculating parts of this orbit can be used in an introductory course as exercises connecting basic definitions in topology and category theory.</description>

      <title>Chessboard and level sets of continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the following result and its discrete equivalent: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and a compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. Additionally, we show that the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of this result.</description>

      <title>The directed Vietoris-Rips complex and homotopy and singular homology groups of finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove analogues of classical results for higher homotopy groups and singular homology groups of pseudotopological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces are a generalization of (\v{C}ech) closure spaces which are in turn a generalization of topological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces also include graphs and directed graphs as full subcategories. Thus they are a bridge that connects classical algebraic topology with the more applied side of topology. More specifically, we show the existence of a long exact sequence for homotopy groups of pairs of pseudotopological spaces and that a weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for homology groups. Our main result is the construction of weak homotopy equivalences between the geometric realizations of directed Vietoris-Rips complexes and their underlying directed graphs. This implies that singular homology groups of finite directed graphs can be efficiently calculated from finite combinatorial structures, despite their associated chain groups being infinite dimensional. This work is similar to the work of McCord for finite topological spaces but in the context of pseudotopological spaces. Our results also give a novel approach for studying (higher) homotopy groups of discrete mathematical structures such as (directed) graphs or digital images.</description>
