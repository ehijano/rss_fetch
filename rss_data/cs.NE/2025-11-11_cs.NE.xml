      <title>A multi parallel mixed-model disassembly line and its balancing optimization for fuel vehicles and pure electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous growth of the number of end-of-life vehicles and the rapid increase in the ownership of pure electric vehicles, the automobile disassembly industry is facing the challenge of transitioning from the traditional fuel vehicles to the mixed disassembly of fuel vehicles and pure electric vehicles. In order to cope with the uncertainty of recycling quantity and the demand of mixed-model disassembly of multiple vehicle types, this paper designs a multi-parallel mixed-model disassembly line (MPMDL), and constructs a corresponding mixed-integer planning model for the equilibrium optimization problem of this disassembly line with the optimization objectives of the minimum number of workstations, the minimum fatigue level of workers and the minimum energy consumption. Combining the differences in disassembly processes between fuel vehicles and pure electric vehicles, an improved non-dominated sorting multi-objective genetic algorithm (INSGA-III) based on the distribution of feasible solutions and dynamic search resource allocation is designed to solve this multi-objective dynamic balance optimization problem, and the two-stage dynamic adjustment strategy is adopted to realize the adaptive adjustment of the disassembly line under the uncertainty of the recycling quantity, and, recently, arithmetic validation is carried out. The results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the resource utilization efficiency, reduce energy consumption, alleviate the workers' load, and provide multiple high-quality disassembly solutions under the multi-objective trade-off. Compared with mainstream multi-objective optimization algorithms, the INSGA-III algorithm shows significant advantages in terms of solution quality, convergence and stability. This study provides a green, efficient and flexible solution for hybrid disassembly of fuel and pure electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Cannistraci-Hebb Training on Ultra-Sparse Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's spike-based computation, spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently possess temporal activation sparsity. However, when it comes to the sparse training of SNNs in the structural connection domain, existing methods fail to achieve ultra-sparse network structures without significant performance loss, thereby hindering progress in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. This limitation presents a critical challenge: how to achieve high levels of structural connection sparsity while maintaining performance comparable to fully connected networks. To address this challenge, we propose the Cannistraci-Hebb Spiking Neural Network (CH-SNN), a novel and generalizable dynamic sparse training framework for SNNs consisting of four stages. First, we propose a sparse spike correlated topological initialization (SSCTI) method to initialize a sparse network based on node correlations. Second, temporal activation sparsity and structural connection sparsity are integrated via a proposed sparse spike weight initialization (SSWI) method. Third, a hybrid link removal score (LRS) is applied to prune redundant weights and inactive neurons, improving information flow. Finally, the CH3-L3 network automaton framework inspired by Cannistraci-Hebb learning theory is incorporated to perform link prediction for potential synaptic regrowth. These mechanisms enable CH-SNN to achieve sparsification across all linear layers. We have conducted extensive experiments on six datasets including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, evaluating various network architectures such as spiking convolutional neural networks and Spikformer.</description>

      <title>TOPSIS-like metaheuristic for LABS problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of socio-cognitive mutation operators inspired by the TOPSIS method to the Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence (LABS) problem. Traditional evolutionary algorithms, while effective, often suffer from premature convergence and poor exploration-exploitation balance. To address these challenges, we introduce socio-cognitive mutation mechanisms that integrate strategies of following the best solutions and avoiding the worst. By guiding search agents to imitate high-performing solutions and avoid poor ones, these operators enhance both solution diversity and convergence efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TOPSIS-inspired mutation outperforms the base algorithm in optimizing LABS sequences. The study highlights the potential of socio-cognitive learning principles in evolutionary computation and suggests directions for further refinement.</description>

      <title>Parametric Pareto Set Learning for Expensive Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric multi-objective optimization (PMO) addresses the challenge of solving an infinite family of multi-objective optimization problems, where optimal solutions must adapt to varying parameters. Traditional methods require re-execution for each parameter configuration, leading to prohibitive costs when objective evaluations are computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Parametric Pareto Set Learning with multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (PPSL-MOBO), a novel framework that learns a unified mapping from both preferences and parameters to Pareto-optimal solutions. PPSL-MOBO leverages a hypernetwork with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently capture parametric variations, while integrating Gaussian process surrogates and hypervolume-based acquisition to minimize expensive function evaluations. We demonstrate PPSL-MOBO's effectiveness on two challenging applications: multi-objective optimization with shared components, where certain design variables must be identical across solution families due to modular constraints, and dynamic multi-objective optimization, where objectives evolve over time. Unlike existing methods that cannot directly solve PMO problems in a unified manner, PPSL-MOBO learns a single model that generalizes across the entire parameter space. By enabling instant inference of Pareto sets for new parameter values without retraining, PPSL-MOBO provides an efficient solution for expensive PMO problems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Dual-Ranking Strategy for Offline Data-Driven Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline data-driven Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOPs) rely on limited data from simulations, experiments, or sensors. This scarcity leads to high epistemic uncertainty in surrogate predictions. Conventional surrogate methods such as Kriging assume Gaussian distributions, which can yield suboptimal results when the assumptions fail. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet novel dual-ranking strategy, working with a basic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, where the built-in non-dominated sorting is kept and the second rank is devised for uncertainty estimation. In the latter, we utilize the uncertainty estimates given by several surrogate models, including Quantile Regression (QR), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Concretely, with this dual-ranking strategy, each solution's final rank is the average of its non-dominated sorting rank and a rank derived from the uncertainty-adjusted fitness function, thus reducing the risk of misguided optimization under data constraints. We evaluate our approach on benchmark and real-world MOPs, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our dual-ranking strategy significantly improves the performance of NSGA-II in offline settings, achieving competitive outcomes compared with traditional surrogate-based methods. This framework advances uncertainty-aware multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, offering a robust solution for data-limited, real-world applications.</description>

      <title>From LIF to QIF: Toward Differentiable Spiking Neurons for Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired computation but remain underexplored for continuous regression tasks in scientific machine learning. In this work, we introduce and systematically evaluate Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons as an alternative to the conventional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model in both directly trained SNNs and ANN-to-SNN conversion frameworks. The QIF neuron exhibits smooth and differentiable spiking dynamics, enabling gradient-based training and stable optimization within architectures such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Across benchmarks on function approximation, operator learning, and partial differential equation (PDE) solving, QIF-based networks yield smoother, more accurate, and more stable predictions than their LIF counterparts, which suffer from discontinuous time-step responses and jagged activation surfaces. These results position the QIF neuron as a computational bridge between spiking and continuous-valued deep learning, advancing the integration of neuroscience-inspired dynamics into physics-informed and operator-learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Rigorous Understanding of the Population Dynamics of the NSGA-III: Tight Runtime Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms are widely used for solving multi-objective optimization problems. A prominent example is NSGA-III, which is particularly well suited for solving problems involving more than three objectives, distinguishing it from the classical NSGA-II. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of NSGA III remains very limited, especially with respect to runtime analysis. A central open problem concerns its population dynamics, which involve controlling the maximum number of individuals sharing the same fitness value during the exploration process. In this paper, we make a significant step towards such an understanding by proving tight runtime bounds for NSGA-III on the bi-objective OneMinMax ($2$-OMM) problem. Firstly, we prove that NSGA-III requires $\Omega(n^2 \log(n) / \mu)$ generations in expectation to optimize $2$-OMM assuming the population size $\mu$ satisfies $n+1 \leq \mu =O(\log(n)^c(n+1))$ where $n$ denotes the problem size and $c&lt;1$ is a constant. Apart from~\cite{opris2025multimodal}, this is the first proven lower runtime bound for NSGA-III on a classical benchmark problem. Complementing this, we secondly improve the best known upper bound of NSGA-III on the $m$-objective OneMinMax problem ($m$-OMM) of $O(n \log(n))$ generations by a factor of $\mu /(2n/m + 1)^{m/2}$ for a constant number $m$ of objectives and population size $(2n/m + 1)^{m/2} \leq \mu \in O(\sqrt{\log(n)} (2n/m + 1)^{m/2})$. This yields tight runtime bounds in the case $m = 2$, and the surprising result that NSGA-III beats NSGA-II by a factor of $\mu/n$ in the expected runtime.</description>

      <title>Improved Runtime Guarantees for the SPEA2 Multi-Objective Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II, the SPEA2 is one of the most widely used domination-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $\mu \ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $\lambda$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (\lambda+\mu)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $\mu = \Theta(n)$ and $\lambda = O(n)$ but for arbitrary $\mu, \lambda = O(n^k)$. Thus, choosing suitable parameters -- a key challenge in using heuristic algorithms -- is much easier for the SPEA2 than the NSGA-II.</description>

      <title>Gradient Projection onto Historical Descent Directions for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients while optionally preserving data privacy. However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead. We establish convergence guarantees for both algorithms under strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on standard FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that ProjFL and ProjFL+EF achieve accuracy comparable to existing baselines while substantially reducing communication costs.</description>

      <title>Recursive Dynamics in Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Networks: Toward Reflective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\gamma$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\gamma$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\gamma \approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swarm based optimization algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex optimization problems. However, their widespread adoption remains sceptical due to limited transparency in how different algorithmic components influence the overall performance of the algorithm. This work presents a multi-faceted interpretability related investigations of one of the popular swarm algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization. Through this work, we provide a framework that makes the role of different topologies and parameters in PSO interpretable and explainable using novel machine learning approach. We first developed a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features in the problem that affects the optimization performance of PSO. Secondly, we rigorously compare three topologies - Ring, Star, and Von Neumann analyzing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behavior, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO. The work successfully decodes how swarm topologies affect information flow, diversity, and convergence. Through systematic experimentation across 24 benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings uncover the black-box nature of PSO, providing more transparency and interpretability to swarm intelligence systems.

      <title>Stochastic Forward-Forward Learning through Representational Dimensionality Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) learning algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function with well-designed negative samples for contrastive learning. Existing goodness functions are typically defined as the sum of squared postsynaptic activations, neglecting correlated variability between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for noisy copies of individual inputs while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples.We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared output, which is equivalent to making predictions based on an energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

      <title>Mirror Descent Policy Optimisation for Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes, making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained Markov decision process. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based robust constrained Markov decision process setting. The paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments in general Markov decision processes. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID</description>

      <title>Universal Neurons in GPT-2: Emergence, Persistence, and Functional Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained GPT-2 Small models, examining these universal neurons-neurons with consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at five checkpoints, we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions, measured via cross entropy loss. Additionally, we quantify neuron persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training checkpoints, particularly in early and deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and universal representational structures emerge during language model training.</description>

      <title>CodeEvolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.</description>
