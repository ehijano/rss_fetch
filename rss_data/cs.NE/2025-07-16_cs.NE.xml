      <title>Emergent Heterogeneous Swarm Control Through Hebbian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules, thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges, resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.</description>

      <title>Simulated Language Acquisition in a Biologically Realistic Model of the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses, Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun), and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this result.</description>

      <title>The AI Shadow War: SaaS vs. Edge Computing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very DNA of AI architecture presents conflicting paths: centralized cloud-based models (Software-as-a-Service) versus decentralized edge AI (local processing on consumer devices). This paper analyzes the competitive battleground across computational capability, energy efficiency, and data privacy. Recent breakthroughs show edge AI challenging cloud systems on performance, leveraging innovations like test-time training and mixture-of-experts architectures. Crucially, edge AI boasts a 10,000x efficiency advantage: modern ARM processors consume merely 100 microwatts forinference versus 1 watt for equivalent cloud processing. Beyond efficiency, edge AI secures data sovereignty by keeping processing local, dismantling single points of failure in centralized architectures. This democratizes access throughaffordable hardware, enables offline functionality, and reduces environmental impact by eliminating data transmission costs. The edge AI market projects explosive growth from $9 billion in 2025 to $49.6 billion by 2030 (38.5% CAGR), fueled by privacy demands and real-time analytics. Critical applications including personalized education, healthcare monitoring, autonomous transport, and smart infrastructure rely on edge AI's ultra-low latency (5-10ms versus 100-500ms for cloud). The convergence of architectural innovation with fundamental physics confirms edge AI's distributed approach aligns with efficient information processing, signaling the inevitable emergence of hybrid edge-cloud ecosystems.</description>

      <title>BuildEvo: Designing Building Energy Consumption Forecasting Heuristics via LLM-driven Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics. Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.</description>

      <title>MaCE: General Mass Conserving Dynamics for Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Mass-Conserving Evolution (MaCE), a general method for implementing mass conservation in Cellular Automata (CA). MaCE is a simple evolution rule that can be easily 'attached' to existing CAs to make them mass-conserving, which tends to produce interesting behaviours more often, as patterns can no longer explode or die out. We first show that MaCE is numerically stable and admits a simple continuous limit. We then test MaCE on Lenia, and through several experiments, we demonstrate that it produces a wide variety of interesting behaviours, starting from the variety and abundance of solitons up to hints of intrinsic evolution in resource-constrained environments. Finally, we showcase the versatility of MaCE by applying it to Neural-CAs and discrete CAs, and discuss promising research directions opened up by this scheme.</description>

      <title>TDE-3: An improved prior for optical flow computation in spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion detection is a primary task required for robotic systems to perceive and navigate in their environment. Proposed in the literature bioinspired neuromorphic Time-Difference Encoder (TDE-2) combines event-based sensors and processors with spiking neural networks to provide real-time and energy-efficient motion detection through extracting temporal correlations between two points in space. However, on the algorithmic level, this design leads to loss of direction-selectivity of individual TDEs in textured environments. Here we propose an augmented 3-point TDE (TDE-3) with additional inhibitory input that makes TDE-3 direction-selectivity robust in textured environments. We developed a procedure to train the new TDE-3 using backpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to linearly map input velocities into an output spike count or an Inter-Spike Interval (ISI). Our work is the first instance of training a spiking neuron to have a specific ISI. Using synthetic data we compared training and inference with spike count and ISI with respect to changes in stimuli dynamic range, spatial frequency, and level of noise. ISI turns out to be more robust towards variation in spatial frequency, whereas the spike count is a more reliable training signal in the presence of noise. We performed the first in-depth quantitative investigation of optical flow coding with TDE and compared TDE-2 vs TDE-3 in terms of energy-efficiency and coding precision. Results show that on the network level both detectors show similar precision (20 degree angular error, 88% correlation with ground truth). Yet, due to the more robust direction-selectivity of individual TDEs, TDE-3 based network spike less and hence is more energy-efficient. Reported precision is on par with model-based methods but the spike-based processing of the TDEs provides allows more energy-efficient inference with neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Many Objective Problems Where Crossover is Provably Essential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses theory in evolutionary many-objective optimization and focuses on the role of crossover operators. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present two many-objective problems $RR_{\text{RO}}$ and $uRR_{\text{RO}}$ together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the GSEMO and the widely used NSGA-III algorithm to demonstrate that one point crossover on $RR_{\text{RO}}$, as well as uniform crossover on $uRR_{\text{RO}}$, can yield an exponential speedup in the runtime. In particular, when the number of objectives is constant, this algorithms can find the Pareto set of both problems in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover they require exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. For both problems, we also demonstrate a significant performance gap in certain superconstant parameter regimes for the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimization which demonstrates an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives. Additionally, it is the first runtime analysis involving crossover in many-objective optimization where the number of objectives is not necessarily constant.</description>

      <title>Structured and Balanced Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.</description>

      <title>Life, uh, Finds a Way: Hyperadaptability by Behavioral Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living beings are able to solve a wide variety of problems that they encounter rarely or only once. Without the benefit of extensive and repeated experience with these problems, they can solve them in an ad-hoc manner. We call this capacity to always find a solution to a physically solvable problem $hyperadaptability$. To explain how hyperadaptability can be achieved, we propose a theory that frames behavior as the physical manifestation of a self-modifying search procedure. Rather than exploring randomly, our system achieves robust problem-solving by dynamically ordering an infinite set of continuous behaviors according to simplicity and effectiveness. Behaviors are sampled from paths over cognitive graphs, their order determined by a tight behavior-execution/graph-modification feedback loop. We implement cognitive graphs using Hebbian-learning and a novel harmonic neural representation supporting flexible information storage. We validate our approach through simulation experiments showing rapid achievement of highly-robust navigation ability in complex mazes, as well as high reward on difficult extensions of classic reinforcement learning problems. This framework offers a new theoretical model for developmental learning and paves the way for robots that can autonomously master complex skills and handle exceptional circumstances.</description>

      <title>The late-stage training dynamics of (stochastic) subgradient descent on homogeneous neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.</description>

      <title>A Group Theoretic Analysis of the Symmetries Underlying Base Addition and Their Learnability by Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learnability is closely correlated with carry function structure. We then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.</description>
