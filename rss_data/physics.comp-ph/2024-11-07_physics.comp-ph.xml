      <title>Neurons for Neutrons: A Transformer Model for Computation Load Estimation on Domain-Decomposed Neutron Transport Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain decomposition is a technique used to reduce memory overhead on large neutron transport problems. Currently, the optimal load-balanced processor allocation for these domains is typically determined through small-scale simulations of the problem, which can be time-consuming for researchers and must be repeated anytime a problem input is changed. We propose a Transformer model with a unique 3D input embedding, and input representations designed for domain-decomposed neutron transport problems, which can predict the subdomain computation loads generated by small-scale simulations. We demonstrate that such a model trained on domain-decomposed Small Modular Reactor (SMR) simulations achieves 98.2% accuracy while being able to skip the small-scale simulation step entirely. Tests of the model's robustness on variant fuel assemblies, other problem geometries, and changes in simulation parameters are also discussed.</description>

      <title>An iterative scheme to include turbulent diffusion in advective-dominated transport of delayed neutron precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the Method of Characteristics (MOC) for Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) is used to solve the precursors balance equation with turbulent diffusion. The diffusivity of DNPs, significantly higher than molecular diffusivity, emerges in turbulent flows from the time-averaging of the DNPs mass balance equation. To integrate this effect within the MOC framework, the advection-reaction component of the DNPs balance equation is solved using the MOC, while the diffusive source is computed from the concentration of the previous iteration. The method is validated on a 2D recirculating pipe reactor with high Reynolds number flow, comparing the MOC with diffusion to a standard finite volume (FV) discretization of the fission products balance equation. Additionally, the impact of the diffusivity term on DNP distributions and reactor reactivity is quantified as a function of the turbulent Schmidt number.</description>

      <title>Many body theory beyond GW : towards a complete description of 2-body correlated propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with Hedins equations, simple expressions for the irreducible self-energy are derived. The derivation with vertex effects included in the self-energy results in a number of terms beyond GW such as second-order screened exchange (the term that also gives rise to vertex/excitonic effects in the polarisation) and an infinite series describing correlations between the added-particle(removed-hole) and the excited electrons and holes: the screened T-matrix channels. Two-body correlated propagation is considered, with the third propagating freely, however, 3-body correlations are discussed and these can be added hierarchically to the method. For electron-hole propagation the reducible polarisation is calculated, which results in an expression for the self-energy that can be solved analytically without the need for widely used expensive numerical methods for frequency integration or having to adopt the plasmon-pole approximation. The method requires diagonalisation of the usual particle-hole matrix - derived from the Bethe-Salpter equation - and also a particle-particle and hole-hole matrix that has a similar structure; with the second-order exchange present in all channels. The method goes beyond current widely used methods that adopt the GW approximation, whilst being abinitio in nature and requiring relatively modest extensions to existing functionality, e.g., it could be implemented in the sophisticated quasiparticle self-consistent framework. It is anticipated the method will significantly improve on the accuracy of current state-of-the-art calculations, improving our understanding of processes in simple and strongly-correlated systems, with the additional contributions demanding a similar cost to methods that include vertex effects in the polarisation only.</description>

      <title>FUsion-based ConstitutivE model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutive modeling is crucial for engineering design and simulations to accurately describe material behavior. However, traditional phenomenological models often struggle to capture the complexities of real materials under varying stress conditions due to their fixed forms and limited parameters. While recent advances in deep learning have addressed some limitations of classical models, purely data-driven methods tend to require large datasets, lack interpretability, and struggle to generalize beyond their training data. To tackle these issues, we introduce "Fusion-based Constitutive model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling". This approach combines established phenomenological models with an ICNN architecture, designed to train on the limited and noisy force-displacement data typically available in practical applications. The hybrid model inherently adheres to necessary constitutive conditions. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout is employed to generate Bayesian predictions, providing mean values and confidence intervals that quantify uncertainty. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness by learning two isotropic constitutive models and one anisotropic model with a single fiber direction, across six different stress states. The framework's applicability is also showcased in finite element simulations across three geometries of varying complexities. Our results highlight the framework's superior extrapolation capabilities, even when trained on limited and noisy data, delivering accurate and physically meaningful predictions across all numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Analysis of thermodiffusive instabilities in hydrogen premixed flames using a tabulated flamelet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preferential diffusion plays a critical role in the evolution of lean premixed hydrogen flames, influencing flame surface corrugation and overall flame behavior. Simulating such flames with tabulated chemistry (TC) methods remains challenging due to the complexity of flame dynamics. A detailed assessment of flamelet-based manifolds for capturing these dynamics is still needed. This work incorporates preferential diffusion via mixture-averaged molecular diffusion within TC to study the propagation and structure of freely propagating hydrogen flames influenced by intrinsic instabilities. Model performance is evaluated against detailed chemistry (DC) calculations, focusing on linear and non-linear regimes and sensitivity to pressure and temperature variations. The impact of mesh resolution on flame response is also examined to assess the method's capabilities without subgrid models. The linear regime is analyzed through the dispersion relation, revealing that higher temperature or pressure extends the range of wave numbers accurately predicted by the model, although some overprediction of flame wrinkling in stable regions is observed. The nonlinear regime is assessed by comparing global flame parameters and flame structure to reference solutions, showing that the model captures key flame descriptors with relative errors under 20%. Overall, the model effectively reproduces key effects governing flames with thermodiffusive instabilities, offering a viable alternative to DC at a significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Energy-based physics-informed neural network for frictionless contact problems under large deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods for contact mechanics are of great importance in engineering applications, enabling the prediction and analysis of complex surface interactions under various conditions. In this work, we propose an energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework for solving frictionless contact problems under large deformation. Inspired by microscopic Lennard-Jones potential, a surface contact energy is used to describe the contact phenomena. To ensure the robustness of the proposed PINN framework, relaxation, gradual loading and output scaling techniques are introduced. In the numerical examples, the well-known Hertz contact benchmark problem is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PINNs framework. Moreover, challenging contact problems with the consideration of geometrical and material nonlinearities are tested. It has been shown that the proposed PINNs framework provides a reliable and powerful tool for nonlinear contact mechanics. More importantly, the proposed PINNs framework exhibits competitive computational efficiency to the commercial FEM software when dealing with those complex contact problems. The codes used in this manuscript are available at https://github.com/JinshuaiBai/energy_PINN_Contact.(The code will be available after acceptance)</description>

      <title>Convergence study of multi-field singular value decomposition for turbulence fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03739v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence of a matrix decomposition technique, the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD) which efficiently analyzes nonlinear correlations by simultaneously decomposing multiple fields, is investigated. Toward applications in turbulence studies, we demonstrate that SVD for an artificial matrix with multi-scale structures reproduces the power-law-like distribution in the singular value spectrum with several orthogonal modes. Then, MFSVD is applied to practical turbulence field data produced by numerical simulations. It is clarified that relative errors in the reproduction of quadratic nonlinear quantities in multi-field turbulence converge remarkably faster than the single-field case, which requires thousands of modes to converge.</description>

      <title>Electron correlation effects and spin-liquid state in the Herbertsmithite Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ real-space variational quantum Monte Carlo methods with resonating valence bond many-body wave functions to investigate electron correlation effects in the Kagome system $Zn_xCu_{4-x}O_6$. Using three trial wave functions of the Slater-Jastrow type, where (i) only the Jastrow correlation factor is optimized and the orbitals obtained by density functional theory, (ii) both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized, and (iii) additionally the Slater determinant is substituted by an antisymmetrized-geminal power wave function, we analyze static and dynamic correlation energies across concentrations $x=0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 1$. Our results show that the correlation energy increases with the concentration of $Zn_x$. Optimizing the Slater determinant significantly enhances the correlation energy by approximately $\sim -73(4) mHa$ per electron. Eventually, the emergence of a quantum spin liquid state driven by a long-range correlation energy is discussed.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Influence Over Leading and Pursuing Motorcycles Equipped With Downforce-Generation Wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aerodynamic influence of a wing-equipped motorcycle on a pursuing motorcycle presents critical implications for stability and performance. This study investigates the induced flow dynamics, characterized by a turbulent and complex wake that significantly affects the aerodynamic forces and moments experienced by the following motorcycle. The presence of aerodynamic appendices on the leading motorcycle intensifies these effects, generating coherent wingtip vortices that propagate downstream-a typical behavior of lift-generating devices. In this work, numerical simulations reveal that the aerodynamic consequences vary with the relative positioning of the pursuing motorcycle. A lateral offset can reduce wheelie tendencies due to beneficial flow interactions, while lateral alignment and longitudinal positioning variation may exacerbate negative aerodynamic impacts, compromising stability. Contrary to initial expectations, the simulations in this work demonstrate that the turbulent wake and the coherent vortex pair influence the pursuing motorcycle's behavior independently, persisting across all tested relative distances. While the turbulent wake usually creates a low-pressure region that facilitates drafting, the presence of coherent vortices reduces this advantage by introducing additional lift through the upwash velocity component. Conversely, specific lateral deviations can lessen wheelie effects, with downwash becoming the dominant flow component. Although difficult to be removed promptly due to being part of the overall high performance motorcycle design, it is suggested that the downforce generating aerodynamic appendices removal should be considered by the motorcycling competition governing bodies to provide better safety and racing conditions at all categories that make use of it.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a multimodal distribution is a fundamental and challenging problem in computational science and statistics. Among various approaches proposed for this task, one popular method is Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based version of AIS by combining it with population-based Monte Carlo methods to improve its efficiency. By keeping track of an ensemble instead of a single particle along some continuation path between the starting distribution and the target distribution, we take advantage of the interaction within the ensemble to encourage the exploration of undiscovered modes. Specifically, our main idea is to utilize either the snooker algorithm or the genetic algorithm used in Evolutionary Monte Carlo. We discuss how the proposed algorithm can be implemented and derive a partial differential equation governing the evolution of the ensemble under the continuous time and mean-field limit. We also test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on various continuous and discrete distributions.</description>

      <title>Informative and non-informative decomposition of turbulent flow fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Not all the information in a turbulent field is relevant for understanding particular regions or variables in the flow. Here, we present a method for decomposing a source field into its informative $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_I(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ and residual $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_R(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ components relative to another target field. The method is referred to as informative and non-informative decomposition (IND). All the necessary information for physical understanding, reduced-order modelling, and control of the target variable is contained in $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_I(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, whereas $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_R(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ offers no substantial utility in these contexts. The decomposition is formulated as an optimisation problem that seeks to maximise the time-lagged mutual information of the informative component with the target variable while minimising the mutual information with the residual component. The method is applied to extract the informative and residual components of the velocity field in a turbulent channel flow, using the wall-shear stress as the target variable. We demonstrate the utility of IND in three scenarios: (i) physical insight of the effect of the velocity fluctuations on the wall-shear stress, (ii) prediction of the wall-shear stress using velocities far from the wall, and (iii) development of control strategies for drag reduction in a turbulent channel flow using opposition control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is essential for studying dynamical properties in condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and complex materials, yet it poses a significant theoretical and computational challenge. Our work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by accurately capturing many-body correlations. Therefore, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which are enhanced through neural networks parameterizations. To compute the optimal time-dependent parameters, we utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique and a new method based on Taylor-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kubo and Keldysh Approaches to Fermi-Sea-Dependent Nonequilibrium Observables: Application to Spin Hall Current and Spin-Orbit Torque in Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the nonequilibrium density operator in the steady-state linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest, such as the spin density, spin current density, etc., gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about the vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects as a testbed. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer formulation of quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensures continuous energy spectrum and evades the need for commonly used phenomenological broadening introducing ambiguity; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.</description>

      <title>Slope of Magnetic Field-Density Relation as An Indicator of Magnetic Dominance</title>

Abstract: The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfv\'enic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation}
  \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.</description>

      <title>Explain Like I'm Five: Using LLMs to Improve PDE Surrogate Models with Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.</description>

      <title>Practical, optimal preparation of general quantum state with exponentially improved robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, as a general process of loading classical data to quantum device, is essential for end-to-end implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, existing methods suffer from either high circuit depth or complicated hardware, limiting their practicality and robustness. In this work, we overcome these limitations with a bucket-brigade approach. The tree architectures of our hardware represents the simplest connectivity required for achieving sub-exponential circuit depth. Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. More specifically, the infidelity scales as $O(\text{polylog}(N))$ with data size $N$, as oppose to $O(N)$ for conventional methods. Moreover, our approach is the first to simultaneously achieve linear Clifford$+T$ circuit depth, gate count number, and space-time allocation. These advancements offer the opportunity for processing big data in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>
