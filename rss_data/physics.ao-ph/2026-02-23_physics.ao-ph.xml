      <title>Spectral Homogenization of the Radiative Transfer Equation via Low-Rank Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer in absorbing-scattering media requires solving a transport equation across a spectral domain with 10^5 - 10^6 molecular absorption lines. Line-by-line (LBL) computation is prohibitively expensive, while existing approximations sacrifice spectral fidelity. We show that the Young-measure homogenization framework produces solution tensors I that admit low-rank tensor-train (TT) decompositions whose bond dimensions remain bounded as the spectral resolution Ns increases. Using molecular line parameters from the HITRAN database for H2O and CO2, we demonstrate that: (i) the TT rank saturates at r = 8 (at tolerance e = 10^-6) from Ns = 16 to 4096, independent of single-scattering albedo, Henyey-Greenstein asymmetry, temperature, and pressure; (ii) quantized tensor-train (QTT) representations achieve sub-linear storage scaling; (iii) in a controlled comparison using identical opacity data and transport solver, the homogenized approach achieves over an order of magnitude lower L2 error than the correlated-k distribution at equal cost; and (iv) for atomic plasma opacity (aluminum at 60 eV, TOPS database), the TT rank saturates at r = 15 with fundamentally different spectral structure (bound-bound and bound-free transitions spanning 12 decades of dynamic range), confirming that rank boundedness is a property of the transport equation rather than any particular opacity source. These results establish that the spectral complexity of radiative transfer has a finite effective rank exploitable by tensor decomposition, complementing the spatial-angular compression achieved by existing TT and dynamical low-rank approaches.</description>

      <title>Buoy observation of high frequency ocean wave energy: accuracy, consistency, and concerns for predictive applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational data from buoys are of primary importance during the development, calibration, and evaluation of ocean wave models, and these data are also used to make real-time corrections to operational models via data assimilation. By association, systematic inaccuracies in any buoy data are equally important, and thus when two buoy types provide systematically inconsistent information, this is a concern for anyone using an ocean wave model. This report is concerned with the accuracy of the high frequency portion of the ocean wave spectrum commonly observable by buoys, roughly 0.2 to 0.6 Hz. We evaluate four buoy types (two moored, two drifting) using two quantitative measures. The first involves comparing each type with a co-located ocean wave model. The second method involves evaluation of high frequency energy level as a function of wind speed. Both evaluation methods suggest that the Datawell Waverider (DWR) buoys have a strong tendency to report higher energy levels than the other three buoy types. We evaluate high frequency energy level using three different metrics (mean square slope, energy in a band of high frequencies, and spectral density at a single, specific band, 0.4 Hz), and the conclusions are found to be insensitive to the parameter used.</description>
