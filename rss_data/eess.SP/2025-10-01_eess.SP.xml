      <title>WaveMind: Towards a Conversational EEG Foundation Model Aligned to Textual and Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However, the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.</description>

      <title>Standardized Machine-Readable Point-Data Format for Consolidating Wireless Propagation Across Environments, Frequencies, and Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necessity of new spectrum for 6G has intensified global interest in radio propagation measurements across emerging frequency bands, use cases, and antenna types. These measurements are vital for understanding radio channel properties in diverse environments, and involve time-consuming and expensive campaigns. A major challenge for the effective utilization of propagation measurement data has been the lack of a standardized format for reporting and archiving results. Although organizations such as NIST, NGA, and 3GPP have made commendable efforts for data pooling, a unified machine-readable data format for consolidating measurements across different institutions and frequencies remains a missing piece in advancing global standardization efforts. This paper introduces a standardized point-data format for radio propagation measurements and demonstrates how institutions may merge disparate campaigns into a common format. This data format, alongside an environmental map and a measurement summary metadata table, enables integration of data from disparate sources by using a structured representation of key parameters. Here, we show the efficacy of the point-data format standard using data gathered from two independent sub-THz urban microcell (UMi) campaigns: 142 GHz measurements at New York University (NYU) and 145 GHz measurements at the University of Southern California (USC). A joint path loss analysis using the close-in path loss model (1 m ref. distance) yields a refined estimate of the path loss exponent (PLE) employing the proposed standard to pool measurements. Other statistics such as RMS delay spread and angular spread are also determined using a joint point-data table. Adopting this simple, unified format will accelerate channel model development, build multi-institutional datasets, and feed AI/ML applications with reliable training data in a common format from many sources.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Beam Learning for Full-Duplex Massive MIMO Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing beamforming-based full-duplex solutions for multi-antenna wireless systems often rely on explicit estimation of the self-interference channel. The pilot overhead of such estimation, however, can be prohibitively high in millimeter-wave and massive MIMO systems, thus limiting the practicality of existing solutions, especially in fast-fading conditions. In this work, we present a novel beam learning framework that bypasses explicit self-interference channel estimation by designing beam codebooks to efficiently obtain implicit channel knowledge that can then be processed by a deep learning network to synthesize transmit and receive beams for full-duplex operation. Simulation results using ray-tracing illustrate that our proposed technique can allow a full-duplex base station to craft serving beams that couple low self-interference while delivering high SNR, with 75-97% fewer measurements than would be required for explicit estimation of the self-interference channel.</description>

      <title>A Point Process Model of Skin Conductance Responses in a Stroop Task for Predicting Depression and Suicidal Ideation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of mental health biomarkers can enable earlier detection and objective assessment of compromised mental well-being. In this study, we analyze electrodermal activity recorded during an Emotional Stroop task to capture sympathetic arousal dynamics associated with depression and suicidal ideation. We model the timing of skin conductance responses as a point process whose conditional intensity is modulated by task-based covariates, including stimulus valence, reaction time, and response accuracy. The resulting subject-specific parameter vector serves as input to a machine learning classifier for distinguishing individuals with and without depression. Our results show that the model parameters encode meaningful physiological differences associated with depressive symptomatology and yield superior classification performance compared to conventional feature extraction methods.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Using Non-Contact Electrodes for Fetal ECG Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular physiological monitoring of maternal and fetal parameters is indispensable for ensuring safe outcomes during pregnancy and parturition. Fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) assessment is crucial to detect fetal distress and developmental anomalies. Given challenges of prenatal care due to the lack of medical professionals and the limit of accessibility, especially in remote and resource-poor areas, we develop a fECG monitoring system using novel non-contact electrodes (NCE) to record the fetal/maternal ECG (f/mECG) signals through clothes, thereby improving the comfort during measurement. The system is designed to be incorporated inside a maternity belt with data acquisition, data transmission module as well as novel NCEs. Thorough characterizations were carried out to evaluate the novel NCE against traditional wet electrodes (i.e., Ag/AgCl electrodes), showing comparable performance. A successful {preliminary pilot feasibility study} conducted with pregnant women (n = 10) between 25 and 32 weeks of gestation demonstrates the system's performance, usability and safety.</description>

      <title>Geometric Spatio-Spectral Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel regularization method, named Geometric Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (GeoSSTV), for hyperspectral (HS) image denoising and destriping. HS images are inevitably affected by various types of noise due to the measurement equipment and environment. Total Variation (TV)-based regularization methods that model the spatio-spectral piecewise smoothness inherent in HS images are promising approaches for HS image denoising and destriping. However, existing TV-based methods are based on classical anisotropic and isotropic TVs, which cause staircase artifacts and lack rotation invariance, respectively, making it difficult to accurately recover round structures and oblique edges. To address this issue, GeoSSTV introduces a geometrically consistent formulation of TV that measures variations across all directions in a Euclidean manner. Through this formulation, GeoSSTV removes noise while preserving round structures and oblique edges. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising problem as a constrained convex optimization problem involving GeoSSTV and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results on HS images contaminated with mixed noise demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Radiation Pattern Reconfigurable FAS-Empowered Interference-Resilient UAV Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) has propelled the development of advanced techniques on countering unauthorized UAV flights. However, the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains under-addressed. This paper proposes radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (RPR-FAS)-empowered interference-resilient UAV communication scheme. This scheme integrates the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology, which provides each antenna with an adjustable radiation pattern. Therefore, RPR-FAS can enhance the angular resolution of a UAV with a limited number of antennas, thereby improving spectral efficiency (SE) and interference resilience. Specifically, we first design dedicated radiation pattern adapted from 3GPP-TR-38.901, where the beam direction and half power beamwidth are tailored for UAV communications. Furthermore, we propose a low-storage-overhead orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors algorithm, which accurately estimates the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the communication link, even in the single antenna case. Particularly, by utilizing the Fourier transform to the radiation pattern gain matrix, we design a dimension-reduction technique to achieve 1--2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements. Meanwhile, we propose a maximum likelihood interference AoA estimation method based on the law of large numbers, so that the SE can be further improved. Finally, alternating optimization is employed to obtain the optimal uplink radiation pattern and combiner, while an exhaustive search is applied to determine the optimal downlink pattern, complemented by the water-filling algorithm for beamforming. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform traditional methods in terms of angular sensing precision and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Path Loss Prediction in Suburban Environment in the Sub-6 GHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate path loss (PL) prediction is crucial for successful network planning, antenna design, and performance optimization in wireless communication systems. Several conventional approaches for PL prediction have been adopted, but they have been demonstrated to lack flexibility and accuracy. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) models in predicting PL, particularly for the sub-6 GHz band in a suburban campus of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). For training purposes, we generate synthetic datasets using the ray-tracing simulation technique. The feasibility and accuracy of the ML-based PL models are verified and validated using both synthetic and measurement datasets. The random forest regression (RFR) and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms provide the best PL prediction accuracy compared to other ML models. In addition, we compare the performance of the developed ML-based PL models with the traditional propagation models, including COST-231 Hata, Longley-Rice, and Close-in models. The results show the superiority of the ML-based PL models compared to conventional models. Therefore, the ML approach using the ray-tracing technique can provide a promising and cost-effective solution for predicting and modeling radio wave propagation in various scenarios in a flexible manner.</description>

      <title>Null-Shaping for Interference Mitigation in LEO Satellites Under Location Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) poses a growing challenge to satellite communications, particularly in uplink channels of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) systems, due to increasing spectrum congestion and uncertainty in the location of terrestrial interferers. This paper addresses the impact of RFI source position uncertainty on beamforming-based interference mitigation. First, we analytically characterize how geographic uncertainty in RFI location translates into angular deviation as observed from the satellite. Building on this, we propose a robust null-shaping framework to increase resilience in the communication links by incorporating the probability density function (PDF) of the RFI location uncertainty into the beamforming design via stochastic optimization. This allows adaptive shaping of the antenna array's nulling pattern to enhance interference suppression under uncertainty. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating realistic satellite orbital dynamics and various RFI scenarios, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly improved mitigation performance compared to conventional deterministic designs.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface in Multipath Fading Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of simulating a single-input single-output reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted channel is presented using three channel black boxes to represent the direct signal path, the transmit path to the RIS and the reflected path from the RIS. The complex coefficients for each channel box is obtained by ray tracing in a scenario with geographic terrain information that also contains approximate building shapes. The electrical characteristics of the ground and building walls were also accounted for in the ray tracing function. Simulations were conducted with reflected rays only and reflected rays together with diffracted rays. The received power exhibits variations typical of multipath fading environments. In the best locations, the RIS-assisted channel simulation result agrees well with theoretical models, the performance increasing by the RIS size squared as the number of RIS elements is increased. In the simplified theoretical model where the transmitter and receiver are inline and the RIS orthogonal but much closer than the distance between the former elements, the simulation results also corroborate best deployment close the transmitter or the receiver with a U-shaped drop between them.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI meets Neural Architecture Search: Proactive Traffic Prediction for AI-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks require intelligent traffic prediction to enable autonomous resource management and handle diverse, dynamic service demands. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework provides a promising foundation for embedding machine learning intelligence through its disaggregated architecture and programmable interfaces. This work applies a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based framework that dynamically selects and orchestrates efficient Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for traffic prediction in O-RAN environments. Our approach leverages the O-RAN paradigm by separating architecture optimisation (via non-RT RIC rApps) from real-time inference (via near-RT RIC xApps), enabling adaptive model deployment based on traffic conditions and resource constraints. Experimental evaluation across six LSTM architectures demonstrates that lightweight models achieve $R^2 \approx 0.91$--$0.93$ with high efficiency for regular traffic, while complex models reach near-perfect accuracy ($R^2 = 0.989$--$0.996$) during critical scenarios. Our NAS-based orchestration achieves a 70-75\% reduction in computational complexity compared to static high-performance models, while maintaining high prediction accuracy when required, thereby enabling scalable deployment in real-world edge environments.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in Large Scale Wireless Communication Networks: Scalability Across Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of wireless systems has accelerated the move from traditional methods to learning-based solutions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are especially well-suited here, since wireless networks can be naturally represented as graphs. A key property of GNNs is transferability: models trained on one graph often generalize to much larger graphs with little performance loss. While empirical studies have shown that GNN-based wireless policies transfer effectively, existing theoretical guarantees do not capture this phenomenon. Most works focus on dense graphs where node degrees scale with network size, an assumption that fails in wireless systems. In this work, we provide a formal theoretical foundation for transferability on Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs), a sparse and widely used model of wireless networks. We further validate our results through numerical experiments on power allocation, a fundamental resource management task.</description>

      <title>A Robust Proactive Communication Strategy for Distributed Active Noise Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) systems assign the high computational load of conventional centralized algorithms across multiple processing nodes, leveraging inter-node communication to collaboratively suppress unwanted noise. However, communication overhead can undermine algorithmic stability and degrade overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a robust communication framework that integrates adaptive-fixed-filter switching and the mixed-gradient combination strategy. In this approach, each node independently executes a single-channel filtered reference least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm while monitoring real-time noise reduction levels. When the current noise reduction performance degrades compared to the previous state, the node halts its adaptive algorithm, switches to a fixed filter, and simultaneously initiates a communication request. The exchanged information comprises the difference between the current control filter and the filter at the time of the last communication, equivalent to the accumulated gradient sum during non-communication intervals. Upon receiving neighboring cumulative gradients, the node employs a mixed-gradient combination method to update its control filter, subsequently reverting to the adaptive mode. This proactive communication strategy and adaptive-fixed switching mechanism ensure system robustness by mitigating instability risks caused by communication issues. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves noise reduction performance comparable to centralized algorithms while maintaining stability under communication constraints, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world distributed ANC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improved Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Unsupervised Subspace Modeling in the Signed Cumulative Distribution Transform Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures. Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

While first-order Ambisonics (FOA) notably facilitates hardware-efficient acquisition and storage of sound fields as compared to high-order Ambisonics (HOA), its low spatial resolution limits realism, highlighting the need for Ambisonics upscaling (AU) as an approach for increasing the order of Ambisonics signals. In this work we propose DiffAU, a cascaded AU method that leverages recent developments in diffusion models combined with novel adaptation to spatial audio to generate 3rd order Ambisonics from FOA. By learning data distributions, DiffAU provides a principled approach that rapidly and reliably reproduces HOA in various settings. Experiments in anechoic conditions with multiple speakers, show strong objective and perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Driven AI Agent Communications: Challenges and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration. Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third, semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness, while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential for AI agent communication networks.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Learning-based Conformal Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of conformal novelty detection. In particular, we focus on AdaDetect, a powerful learning-based framework for novelty detection with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. While AdaDetect provides rigorous statistical guarantees under benign conditions, its behavior under adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. We first formulate an oracle attack setting that quantifies the worst-case degradation of FDR, deriving an upper bound that characterizes the statistical cost of attacks. This idealized formulation directly motivates a practical and effective attack scheme that only requires query access to AdaDetect's output labels. Coupling these formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial algorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of AdaDetect on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial perturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high detection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled novelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust alternatives.</description>

      <title>UniverSR: Unified and Versatile Audio Super-Resolution via Vocoder-Free Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution that employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional distribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional two-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then rely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method directly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design not only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical bottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is fundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our model consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse upsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and general audio datasets.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Fault Classification and Localization in Power System Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2 of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for geometric graphs containing scalar and vector node features. This new scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization for faster convergence in matrix sensing.</description>

      <title>Model-based traffic state estimation using camera-equipped probe vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of estimating traffic states for road links. We propose an innovative approach that leverages partial trajectory data captured by camera-equipped probe vehicles traveling in the opposite lane. The methodology combines state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for extracting vehicle trajectories from street-view video sequences with a novel estimation technique based on the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Our approach first calibrates Fundamental Diagram (FD) parameters using observed cell densities, then estimates boundary conditions for all space-time diagrams. We validate the method using simulated traffic data from three different types of links and parameter settings. Results show that the proposed methodology can estimate traffic densities in unobserved regions, even with limited data availability. This research contributes to the field by introducing a cost-effective, high-resolution traffic data collection method and a robust estimation technique for comprehensive traffic state information. While the study shows promising results, it also identifies areas for improvement, including refining models, optimizing processes, and testing with real-world data to enhance accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Toward Foundational Model for Sleep Analysis Using a Multimodal Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Is Limited Participant Diversity Impeding EEG-based Machine Learning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to electroencephalography (EEG) has great potential to advance both neuroscientific research and clinical applications. However, the generalisability and robustness of EEG-based ML models often hinge on the amount and diversity of training data. It is common practice to split EEG recordings into small segments, thereby increasing the number of samples substantially compared to the number of individual recordings or participants. We conceptualise this as a multi-level data generation process and investigate the scaling behaviour of model performance with respect to the overall sample size and the participant diversity through large-scale empirical studies. We then use the same framework to investigate the effectiveness of different ML strategies designed to address limited data problems: data augmentations and self-supervised learning. Our findings show that model performance scaling can be severely constrained by participant distribution shifts and provide actionable guidance for data collection and ML research. The code for our experiments is publicly available online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the problem of learning linear block codes optimized for Belief-Propagation decoders significantly improving performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Our previous research is extended with an enhanced system design that facilitates a more effective learning process for the parity check matrix. We simplify the input dataset, restrict the number of parameters to learn and improve the gradient back-propagation within the model. We also introduce novel optimizers specifically designed for discrete-valued weights. Based on conventional gradient computation, these optimizers provide discrete weights updates, enabling finer control and improving explainability of the learning process. Through these changes, we consistently achieve improved code performance, provided appropriately chosen hyper-parameters. To rigorously evaluate the performance of learned codes in the context of short to medium block lengths, we propose a comprehensive code performance assessment framework. This framework enables a fair comparison between our learning methodology and random search approaches, ensuring statistical significance in our results. The proposed model pave the way for a new approach to the efficient learning of linear block codes tailored to specific decoder structures.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Power Radiation Model and Optimal Beamforming Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

      <title>Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</description>

Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</description>

      <title>Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference</title>

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</description>

      <title>Toward a Robust R2D2 Paradigm for Radio-interferometric Imaging: Revisiting Deep Neural Network Training and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02554</link>

Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalizability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. First, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomizing Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multiscan multinoise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Second, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Third, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense skip connections, weight normalization, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MPCA-based Domain Adaptation for Transfer Learning in Ultrasonic Guided Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques. Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.</description>
