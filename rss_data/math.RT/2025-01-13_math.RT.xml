      <title>Skein Construction of Balanced Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields, including representation theory, quantum field theory (conformal in 2 dimensions, and topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional objects, topological phases of matter, and topological quantum computation. In essence, it is a categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. In this analogy, the Deligne tensor product $\boxtimes$ is to the linear tensor $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}$ as the balanced tensor product $\boxtimes_C$ is to the tensor over algebra $\otimes_A$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and $C$ is a tensor category.
  Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products were known, including categories of modules, internal Hom spaces, and generalized categorical centers. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model naturally arises from the 3-functor in the classification of fully extended field theories. Building on this result, we establish this long-anticipated proof in an upcoming work.</description>

      <title>Characteristically nilpotent Lie groups with flat coadjoint orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of certain characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras with flat coadjoint orbits. Their connected, simply connected Lie groups admit square-integrable representations modulo the center. There are many examples of nilpotent Lie groups admitting families of dilations and square-integrable representations. Much less is known about examples admitting square-integrable representations for which the quotient by the center does not admit a family of dilations. In this paper we construct a two-parameter family of characteristically nilpotent Lie groups $G(\alpha,\beta)$ in dimension $11$, admitting square-integrable representations modulo the center $Z$, such that $G(\alpha,\beta)/Z$ does not admit a family of dilations.</description>

      <title>The homological spectrum via definable subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an alternative approach to the homological spectrum of a tensor-triangulated category through the lens of definable subcategories. This culminates in a proof that the homological spectrum is homeomorphic to a quotient of the Ziegler spectrum. Along the way, we characterise injective objects in homological residue fields in terms of the definable subcategory corresponding to a given homological prime. We use these results to give a purity perspective on the relationship between the homological and Balmer spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We show that the combinatorial definitions of King and Sundaram of the symmetric polynomials of types B and C are indeed symmetric, in the sense that they are invariant by the action of the Weyl groups. Our proof is combinatorial and inspired by Bender and Knuth's classic involutions for type A.</description>

      <title>Generalized Positive Energy Representations of the Group of Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic symmetry groups in general relativity, we consider projective unitary representations $\overline{\rho}$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)$ of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold $M$ that satisfy a so-called generalized positive energy condition. In particular, this captures representations that are in a suitable sense compatible with a KMS state on the von Neumann algebra generated by $\overline{\rho}$. We show that if $M$ is connected and $\dim(M) &gt; 1$, then any such representation is necessarily trivial on the identity component $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)_0$. As an intermediate step towards this result, we determine the continuous second Lie algebra cohomology $H^2_{\mathrm{ct}}(\mathcal{X}_c(M), \mathbb{R})$ of the Lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields. This is subtly different from Gelfand--Fuks cohomology in view of the compact support condition.</description>

      <title>Wigglyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by categorical representation theory, we define the wiggly complex, whose vertices are arcs wiggling around $n+2$ points on a line, and whose faces are sets of wiggly arcs which are pairwise pointed and non-crossing. The wiggly complex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly pseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection with wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the patterns $(2j-1) \cdots i \cdots (2j)$ for $i &lt; 2j-1$ and $(2j) \cdots k \cdots (2j-1)$ for $k &gt; 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced sublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which we give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we observe that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen face of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs with objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of wiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, II: Witt Equivalence and Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can two strongly rational vertex operator algebras or 1+1d rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) be related by topological manipulations? For vertex operator algebras, the term "topological manipulations" refers to operations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal subalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like gauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or interpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite quantum dimension.
  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices and tensor categories, we say that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their modular tensor categories are Witt equivalent. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated by a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two theories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is also sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.
  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to lore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the notion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of unitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite symmetries of the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. We also sketch a "quantum Galois theory" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by incorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible Galois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce two Fibonacci lines. Finally, we discuss $p$-neighborhood of vertex operator algebras, which is a special topological manipulation related to $\mathbb{Z}_p$-orbifolding.</description>
