      <title>The Role of Human Factors in the LastPass Breach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the complex nature of cyber attacks through an analysis of the LastPass breach. It argues for the integration of human-centric considerations into cybersecurity measures, focusing on mitigating factors such as goal-directed behavior, cognitive overload, human biases (e.g., optimism, anchoring), and risky behaviors. Findings from an analysis of this breach offers support to the perspective that addressing both the human and technical dimensions of cyber defense can significantly enhance the resilience of cyber systems against complex threats. This means maintaining a balanced approach while simultaneously simplifying user interactions, making users aware of biases, and discouraging risky practices are essential for preventing cyber incidents.</description>

      <title>AI-generated art perceptions with GenFrame -- an image-generating picture frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-generation models are changing how we express ourselves in visual art. However, what people think of AI-generated art is still largely unexplored, especially compared to traditional art. In this paper, we present the design of an interactive research product, GenFrame - an image-generating picture frame that appears as a traditional painting but offers the viewer the agency to modify the depicted painting. In the current paper, we report on a study where we deployed the GenFrame in a traditional art museum and interviewed visitors about their views on AI art. When provoked by AI-generated art, people need more of the artist's backstory and emotional journey to make the artwork commensurate with traditional art. However, generative AI-enabled interactive experiences open new ways of engaging with art when a turn of a dial can modify art styles or motifs on a painting. A demo can be seen here: https://youtu.be/1rhW4fazaBY.</description>

      <title>Are We in The Zone? Exploring The Features and Method of Detecting Simultaneous Flow Experiences Based on EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When executing interdependent personal tasks for the team's purpose, simultaneous individual flow(simultaneous flow) is the antecedent condition of achieving shared team flow. Detecting simultaneous flow helps better understanding the status of team members, which is thus important for optimizing multi-user interaction systems. However, there is currently a lack exploration on objective features and methods for detecting simultaneous flow. Based on brain mechanism of flow in teamwork and previous studies on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based individual flow detection, this study aims to explore the significant EEG features related to simultaneous flow, as well as effective detection methods based on EEG signals. First, a two-player simultaneous flow task is designed, based on which we construct the first multi-EEG signals dataset of simultaneous flow. Then, we explore the potential EEG signal features that may be related to individual and simultaneous flow and validate their effectiveness in simultaneous flow detection with various machine learning models. The results show that 1) the inter-brain synchrony features are relevant to simultaneous flow due to enhancing the models' performance in detecting different types of simultaneous flow; 2) the features from the frontal lobe area seem to be given priority attention when detecting simultaneous flows; 3) Random Forests performed best in binary classification while Neural Network and Deep Neural Network3 performed best in ternary classification.</description>

      <title>Task Synthesis for Elementary Visual Programming in XLogoOnline Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the XLogoOnline programming platform has gained popularity among novice learners. It integrates the Logo programming language with visual programming, providing a visual interface for learning computing concepts. However, XLogoOnline offers only a limited set of tasks, which are inadequate for learners to master the computing concepts that require sufficient practice. To address this, we introduce XLogoSyn, a novel technique for synthesizing high-quality tasks for varying difficulty levels. Given a reference task, XLogoSyn can generate practice tasks at varying difficulty levels that cater to the varied needs and abilities of different learners. XLogoSyn achieves this by combining symbolic execution and constraint satisfaction techniques. Our expert study demonstrates the effectiveness of XLogoSyn. We have also deployed synthesized practice tasks into XLogoOnline, highlighting the educational benefits of these synthesized practice tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Utility of External Agent Intention Predictor for Human-AI Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching a consensus on the team plans is vital to human-AI coordination. Although previous studies provide approaches through communications in various ways, it could still be hard to coordinate when the AI has no explainable plan to communicate. To cover this gap, we suggest incorporating external models to assist humans in understanding the intentions of AI agents. In this paper, we propose a two-stage paradigm that first trains a Theory of Mind (ToM) model from collected offline trajectories of the target agent, and utilizes the model in the process of human-AI collaboration by real-timely displaying the future action predictions of the target agent. Such a paradigm leaves the AI agent as a black box and thus is available for improving any agents. To test our paradigm, we further implement a transformer-based predictor as the ToM model and develop an extended online human-AI collaboration platform for experiments. The comprehensive experimental results verify that human-AI teams can achieve better performance with the help of our model. A user assessment attached to the experiment further demonstrates that our paradigm can significantly enhance the situational awareness of humans. Our study presents the potential to augment the ability of humans via external assistance in human-AI collaboration, which may further inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Enhance Domain Expert Inclusion in Data Science Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain experts can play a crucial role in guiding data scientists to optimize machine learning models while ensuring contextual relevance for downstream use. However, in current workflows, such collaboration is challenging due to differing expertise, abstract documentation practices, and lack of access and visibility into low-level implementation artifacts. To address these challenges and enable domain expert participation, we introduce CellSync, a collaboration framework comprising (1) a Jupyter Notebook extension that continuously tracks changes to dataframes and model metrics and (2) a Large Language Model powered visualization dashboard that makes those changes interpretable to domain experts. Through CellSync's cell-level dataset visualization with code summaries, domain experts can interactively examine how individual data and modeling operations impact different data segments. The chat features enable data-centric conversations and targeted feedback to data scientists. Our preliminary evaluation shows that CellSync provides transparency and promotes critical discussions about the intents and implications of data operations.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Systematic Data Acquisition and Data-Driven Simulation for the Safety Testing of Automated Driving Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing complexity and criticality of automated driving functions in road traffic and their operational design domains (ODD), there is increasing demand for covering significant proportions of development, validation, and verification in virtual environments and through simulation models.
  If, however, simulations are meant not only to augment real-world experiments, but to replace them, quantitative approaches are required that measure to what degree and under which preconditions simulation models adequately represent reality, and thus, using their results accordingly. Especially in R&amp;D areas related to the safety impact of the "open world", there is a significant shortage of real-world data to parameterize and/or validate simulations - especially with respect to the behavior of human traffic participants, whom automated driving functions will meet in mixed traffic.
  We present an approach to systematically acquire data in public traffic by heterogeneous means, transform it into a unified representation, and use it to automatically parameterize traffic behavior models for use in data-driven virtual validation of automated driving functions.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Botometer: Adversarial Analysis for Social Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social bots play a significant role in many online social networks (OSN) as they imitate human behavior. This fact raises difficult questions about their capabilities and potential risks. Given the recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI), social bots are capable of producing highly realistic and complex content that mimics human creativity. As the malicious social bots emerge to deceive people with their unrealistic content, identifying them and distinguishing the content they produce has become an actual challenge for numerous social platforms. Several approaches to this problem have already been proposed in the literature, but the proposed solutions have not been widely evaluated. To address this issue, we evaluate the behavior of a text-based bot detector in a competitive environment where some scenarios are proposed: \textit{First}, the tug-of-war between a bot and a bot detector is examined. It is interesting to analyze which party is more likely to prevail and which circumstances influence these expectations. In this regard, we model the problem as a synthetic adversarial game in which a conversational bot and a bot detector are engaged in strategic online interactions. \textit{Second}, the bot detection model is evaluated under attack examples generated by a social bot; to this end, we poison the dataset with attack examples and evaluate the model performance under this condition. \textit{Finally}, to investigate the impact of the dataset, a cross-domain analysis is performed. Through our comprehensive evaluation of different categories of social bots using two benchmark datasets, we were able to demonstrate some achivement that could be utilized in future works.</description>

      <title>XRLoc: Accurate UWB Localization to Realize XR Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the location of ultra-wideband (UWB) tag-attached objects and people in the real world is vital to enabling a smooth cyber-physical transition. However, most UWB localization systems today require multiple anchors in the environment, which can be very cumbersome to set up. In this work, we develop XRLoc, providing an accuracy of a few centimeters in many real-world scenarios. This paper will delineate the key ideas which allow us to overcome the fundamental restrictions that plague a single anchor point from localization of a device to within an error of a few centimeters. We deploy a VR chess game using everyday objects as a demo and find that our system achieves $2.4$ cm median accuracy and $5.3$ cm $90^\mathrm{th}$ percentile accuracy in dynamic scenarios, performing at least $8\times$ better than state-of-art localization systems. Additionally, we implement a MAC protocol to furnish these locations for over $10$ tags at update rates of $100$ Hz, with a localization latency of $\sim 1$ ms.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Analysis and Quantitative Assessment of Child Development through Mobile Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent research in the area of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI). The main contributions of the present article are two-fold. First, we present a novel longitudinal CCI database named ChildCIdbLong, which comprises over 600 children aged 18 months to 8 years old, acquired continuously over 4 academic years (2019-2023). As a result, ChildCIdbLong comprises over 12K test acquisitions over a tablet device. Different tests are considered in ChildCIdbLong, requiring different touch and stylus gestures, enabling evaluation of skills like hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, planning, and visual tracking, among others. In addition to the ChildCIdbLong database, we propose a novel quantitative metric called Test Quality (Q), designed to measure the motor and cognitive development of children through their interaction with a tablet device. In order to provide a better comprehension of the proposed Q metric, popular percentile-based growth representations are introduced for each test, providing a two-dimensional space to compare children's development with respect to the typical age skills of the population.
  The results achieved in the present article highlight the potential of the novel ChildCIdbLong database in conjunction with the proposed Q metric to measure the motor and cognitive development of children as they grow up. The proposed framework could be very useful as an automatic tool to support child experts (e.g., paediatricians, educators, or neurologists) for early detection of potential physical/cognitive impairments during children's development.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of LLMs in Introductory Computer Science Education: A Semester-Long Field Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant debate. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, but few have examined the impacts of LLMs on students in entry-level programming courses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To address this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study with 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our research team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the experimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their final scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the control group). Within the experimental group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered tools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their counterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding CodeTutor's capability, though they also had concerns about CodeTutor's limited role in developing critical thinking skills. Over the semester, students' agreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for support from traditional human teaching assistants. Our analysis further reveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with CodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon our results, we discuss the implications of our findings for integrating Generative AI literacy into curricula to foster critical thinking skills and turn to examining the temporal dynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the discrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual capabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve educational outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reproducibility is a major concern across scientific fields. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), in particular, is subject to diverse reproducibility challenges due to the wide range of research methodologies employed. In this article, we explore how the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across all user experience (UX) design and research activities impacts reproducibility in HCI. In particular, we review upcoming reproducibility challenges through the lenses of analogies from past to future (mis)practices like p-hacking and prompt-hacking, general bias, support in data analysis, documentation and education requirements, and possible pressure on the community. We discuss the risks and chances for each of these lenses with the expectation that a more comprehensive discussion will help shape best practices and contribute to valid and reproducible practices around using LLMs in HCI research.</description>

      <title>TimeFlows: Visualizing Process Chronologies from Vast Collections of Heterogeneous Information Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many fact-finding investigations, notably parliamentary inquiries, process chronologies are created to reconstruct how a controversial policy or decision came into existence. Current approaches, like timelines, lack the expressiveness to represent the variety of relations in which historic events may link to the overall chronology. This obfuscates the nature of the interdependence among the events, and the texts from which they are distilled. Based on explorative interviews with expert analysts, we propose an extended, rich set of relationships. We describe how these can be visualized as TimeFlows. We provide an example of such a visualization by illustrating the Childcare Benefits Scandal -- an affair that deeply affected Dutch politics in recent years. This work extends the scope of existing process discovery research into the direction of unveiling non-repetitive processes from unstructured information objects.</description>

      <title>Integrating measures of replicability into scholarly search: Challenges and opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Challenges to reproducibility and replicability have gained widespread attention, driven by large replication projects with lukewarm success rates. A nascent work has emerged developing algorithms to estimate the replicability of published findings. The current study explores ways in which AI-enabled signals of confidence in research might be integrated into the literature search. We interview 17 PhD researchers about their current processes for literature search and ask them to provide feedback on a replicability estimation tool. Our findings suggest that participants tend to confuse replicability with generalizability and related concepts. Information about replicability can support researchers throughout the research design processes. However, the use of AI estimation is debatable due to the lack of explainability and transparency. The ethical implications of AI-enabled confidence assessment must be further studied before such tools could be widely accepted. We discuss implications for the design of technological tools to support scholarly activities and advance replicability.</description>

      <title>"Sometimes You Just Gotta Risk It for the Biscuit": A Portrait of Student Risk-Taking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individuals, including students, make decisions involving risk is a fundamental aspect of behavioral research. Despite the ubiquity of risk in various aspects of life, limited empirical work has explored student risk-taking behavior in computing education. This study aims to partially replicate prior research on risk-taking behavior in software engineers while focusing on students, shedding light on the factors that affect their risk-taking choices. In our work, students were presented with a hypothetical scenario related to meeting a course project deadline, where they had to choose between a risky option and a safer alternative. We examined several factors that might influence these choices, including the framing of the decision (as a potential gain or loss), students' enjoyment of programming, perceived difficulty of programming, and their academic performance in the course. Our findings reveal intriguing insights into student risk-taking behavior. First, similar to software engineers in prior work, the framing of the decision significantly impacted the choices students made, with the loss framing leading to a higher likelihood for risky choices. Surprisingly, students displayed a greater inclination towards risk-taking compared to their professional counterparts in prior research. Furthermore, we observed that students' prior academic performance in the course and their enjoyment of programming had a subtle influence on their risk-taking tendencies, with better-performing students and those who enjoyed programming being marginally more prone to taking risks. Notably, we did not find statistically significant correlations between perceived difficulty of programming and risk-taking behavior among students.</description>
