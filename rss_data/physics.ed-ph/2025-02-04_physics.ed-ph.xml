      <title>Affordances and Challenges of Incorporating a Remote, Cloud-accessible Quantum Experiment into Undergraduate Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technologies transition from the research laboratory into commercial development, the opportunities for students to begin their careers in this new quantum industry are increasing. With these new career pathways, more and more people are considering the best ways to educate students about quantum concepts and relevant skills. In particular, the quantum industry is looking for new employees with experimental skills, but the instructional labs, capstone projects, research experiences, and internships that provide experiences where students can learn these skills are often resource-intensive and not available at all institutions. The quantum company, Infleqtion, recently made its online quantum matter machine Oqtant publicly available, so people around the world could send commands to create and manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates and receive back real experimental data. Making a complex quantum experiment accessible to anyone has the potential to extend the opportunity to work with quantum experiments to students at less-resourced institutions. As a first step in understanding the potential benefits of using such a platform in educational settings, we collected data from instructors and students who were interested in using, or had used, Oqtant. In this study, we investigate instructors' views about reasons they would like to use Oqtant and challenges they would face in doing so. We also provide a concrete example of how Oqtant was used in an upper-division undergraduate quantum mechanics course and the instructor's perception of its benefits. We complement this with the student perspective, discussing student experiences interacting with Oqtant in their course or through think-aloud interviews outside of a course. These results will help the community consider the potential value for students of creating more opportunities to access remote quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Differences in the attitudes and beliefs about science of students in the physics-mathematics and life sciences areas and their impact on teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For this study, we compared the attitudes and beliefs about science of physical science (physics and mathematics) and life science (biochemistry and biology) students at the beginning of their university degrees using the CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) tool. It is worth noting that both groups of students received similar physics courses during their high-school education. Through a detailed analysis of the different categories of the test, we examined the differences in performance in each of the areas that make up the questionnaire. Among other aspects, we found that a considerable percentage of life science students (higher than that of physical science students) adopted a novice type of behavior in problem solving. Finally, we discussed the possible causes of the differences found and their implications for teaching.</description>

      <title>Student reasoning about quantum mechanics while working with physical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction in quantum mechanics is becoming increasingly important as the field is not only a key part of modern physics research, but is also important for emerging technologies. However, many students regard quantum mechanics as a particularly challenging subject, in part because it is considered very mathematical and abstract. One potential way to help students understand and contextualize unintuitive quantum ideas is to provide them opportunities to work with physical apparatus demonstrating these phenomena. In order to understand how working with quantum experiments affects students' reasoning, we performed think-aloud lab sessions of two pairs of students as they worked through a sequence of quantum optics experiments that demonstrated particle-wave duality of photons. Analyzing the in-the-moment student thinking allowed us to identify the resources students activated while reasoning through the experimental evidence of single-photon interference, as well as student ideas about what parts of the experiments were quantum versus classical. This work will aid instructors in helping their students construct an understanding of these topics from their own ideas and motivate future investigations into the use of hands-on opportunities to facilitate student learning about quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Variables: A Physics Classroom Activity on Correlation and Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classroom activity for high school physics students is presented to explore the distinction between correlation and causation. Using data linking ice cream sales to drowning deaths, presented within a fictional news article, students analyze the relationship, create plots, and identify temperature as the hidden variable explaining the correlation. The activity fosters critical thinking by engaging students in scientific reasoning, illustrating how data representation influences conclusions, and supporting the development of scientific literacy and data interpretation skills.</description>
