      <title>Effects of skewing collision cells on transport properties in multiparticle collision dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) is a mesoscale simulation technique that uses a simplified solvent to model hydrodynamic interactions. Rather than interact through pairwise forces, MPCD solvent particles undergo momentum-exchanging collisions within spatially localized cells according to prescribed rules. The conventional MPCD algorithm employs cubic collision cells, but this choice is not optimal for systems that are most naturally described using skewed simulation boxes. Here, we investigate the behavior of a modified MPCD scheme in which the collision cells are aligned with the vectors that define a triclinic (parallelepiped) simulation box. We find that skewing the collision cells has a small but statistically significant impact on the transport properties of the pure solvent. Similar, but more pronounced, effects are found for nearly hard spheres in solution, including a significant decrease in their nominal self-diffusion coefficient and unphysical anisotropy in their self-diffusion tensor. Thus, our analysis indicates that skewed MPCD collision cells may result in spurious behavior and should be used with caution. We posit that these artifacts may be mitigated by grid-free schemes for placing particles into collision cells.</description>

      <title>Anomalous proteinaceous shells with octagonal local order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteinaceous shells useful for various biomedical applications exhibit a wide range of anomalous structures that are fundamentally different from icosahedral viral capsids described by the Caspar-Klug paradigmatic model. Exploring the Protein Data Bank, we have identified nine different types of anomalous shells structurally close to flat octagonal quasicrystals. As we show, these numerous shells have cubic nets cut from short-period approximants of an octagonal tiling composed of square and rhombic tiles. The approximants and parent tiling are easily obtained within the Landau density wave approach, while the nonequilibrium assembly of them can be simulated using the pair potentials derived from critical density waves. Gluing a polyhedron net and mapping it onto a spherical surface induces tile distortions, and to reduce them, we introduce and minimize the effective elastic energy of the system. Thus, we return quasi-equivalence to previously equivalent tiles. Possible cubic faceting of the octagonal spherical tilings is discussed in terms of the topological charge distribution over the tiling vertices. The proposed structural models describe numerous proteinaceous shells including about half of the known symmetrical enzymes. Our results constitute a fundamental basis for further applications of identified octagonal assemblies and can help to discover and study similar systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Responsive Microprintable Soft Nanocomposites with Tunable Nanoparticle Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic remote actuation of soft materials has been demonstrated at the macroscale using hard-magnetic particles for applications such as transforming materials and medical robots. However, due to manufacturing limitations, few microscale magnetically responsive devices exist -- light-based additive manufacturing methods, which are ideal for realizing microscale features, struggle with light scattering induced by the magnetic particles. Moreover, large hard-magnetic microparticles prevent high-resolution features from being manufactured altogether, and soft-magnetic nanoparticles require impractically high loading and high magnetic gradients, incompatible with existing printing techniques. Among successfully fabricated microscale soft-magnetic composites, limited control over magnetic-particle loading, distribution, and matrix-phase stiffness has hindered their functionality. Here, we combine two-photon lithography with iron-oxide nanoparticle co-precipitation to fabricate 3D-printed microscale nanocomposites having features down to 8 um with spatially tunable nanoparticle distribution. Using uniaxial compression experiments and vibrating sample magnetometry, we characterize the mechanical and magnetic properties of the composite, achieving millimeter-scale elastic deformations. We control nanoparticle content by modulating laser power of the print to imbue complex parts with magnetic functionality, demonstrated by a soft robotic gripper and a bistable bit register and sensor. This approach enables precise control of structure and functionality, advancing the development of microscale metamaterials and robots with tunable mechanical and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Unified microscopic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics and ion association in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes with explicit hard-core size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of a functional integral formalism incorporating ionic charge and hard-core (HC) interactions on an equal footing, we formulate a unified theory of equilibrium thermodynamics and ion association in charged solutions. Via comparison with recent Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation results (J. Forsman et al., PCCP 26, 19921 (2024)), it is shown that our approach is able to predict with quantitative precision the pair distributions of monovalent ions with the typical hydrated sizes d = 3.0 A and 4.0 A up to the molar concentration ni = 2.0 M. Moreover, comparison with additional simulation data from the literature indicates that within the characteristic regime of ionic packing fraction eta &lt;0.1, the formalism can accurately account for the ion size dependence of the excess energy and pressure from d = 14.3 A down to d = 1.6 A. Via the adjustment of the hydration radius, the theory can also reproduce the non-monotonic salt dependence of the experimentally measured osmotic coefficients of various aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. In accordance with AFM experiments involving non-aqueous electrolytes, the underlying sharp competition between the opposite charge attraction and the excluded volume constraint is shown to limit the occurrence of substantial ionic pair formation to the submolar concentration regime ni &lt;50 mM; at larger concentrations, HC repulsion hinders ion association and results in the quasi-saturation of the pair fraction curves.</description>

      <title>Elucidation of the Correlation between Molecular Conformation and Shear Viscosity of Polymer Melts under Steady-State Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological behavior of polymer melts is strongly influenced by parameters such as chain length, chain stiffness, and architecture. In particular, shear thinning, characterized by a power-law decrease in shear viscosity with increasing shear rate, has been widely investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. A central question is the connection between molecular conformation under steady flow and the resulting shear-thinning response. In this study, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of linear and ring polymers with varying chain stiffness to examine this relationship, with chain conformations quantified by the gyration tensor. We identified a strong correlation between the velocity-gradient direction component of the gyration tensor and shear viscosity, which exhibits a clear scaling relationship. This indicates that chain extension along the velocity-gradient direction governs the effective frictional force. Notably, this behavior emerges as a general feature, independent of chain architecture and chain stiffness. In addition, shear viscosity was found to correlate with the component of the gyration tensor that is not directly influenced by advective effects of shear flow. Because advection is absent in the direction, polymer chains can be regarded as diffusing freely, and the extent of this diffusion appears to be controlled by the shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous optimization of assembly time and yield in programmable self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational design strategies for self-assembly require a detailed understanding of both the equilibrium state and the assembly kinetics. While the former is starting to be well understood, the latter remains a major theoretical challenge, especially in programmable systems and the so-called semiaddressable regime, where binding is often nondeterministic and the formation of off-target structures negatively influences the assembly. Here, we show that it is possible to simultaneously sculpt the assembly outcome and the assembly kinetics through the underexplored design space of binding energies and particle concentrations. By formulating the assembly process as a complex reaction network, we calculate and optimize the tradeoff between assembly speed and quality, and show that parameter optimization can speed up assembly by many orders of magnitude without lowering the yield of the target structure. Although the exact speedup varies from design to design, we find the largest speedups for nondeterministic systems where unoptimized assembly is the slowest, sometimes even making them assemble faster than optimized fully-addressable designs. Therefore, these results not only solve a key challenge in semiaddressable self-assembly, but further emphasize the utility of semiaddressability, where designs have the potential to be faster as well as cheaper (fewer particle species) and better (higher yield). More broadly, our results highlight the importance of parameter optimization in programmable self-assembly, and provide practical tools for simultaneous optimization of kinetics and yield in a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Compounding formula approach to chromatin and active polymer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active polymers are ubiquitous in nature, and often kicked by persistent noises that break detailed balance. In order to capture the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of such active polymers, we propose a simple yet reliable analytical framework based on a compounding formula. Connecting polymeric dynamics to the isolated monomeric behavior via the notion of tension propagation, the formula allows us to clarify rich scaling scenarios alongside corresponding intuitive physical pictures. We demonstrate distinctive transient and steady-state scalings due to the non-Markovian nature of the active noise. Aside from a paradigmatic example of an active Rouse polymer, we expect the framework to be applicable to wide variety of spatially extended systems including more general polymers (crumpled globule, semiflexible polymers etc), fluctuation of growing interface, and an array of particles in single-file configuration.</description>

      <title>Finite element models for Self-Deployable Miura-folded origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami-inspired self-deployable structures offer lightweight, compact, and autonomous deployment capabilities, making them highly attractive for aerospace and defence applications, such as solar panels, antennas, and reflector systems. This paper presents finite element frameworks for simulating Miura-origami units in ABAQUS, focusing on two deployment mechanisms: elastic strain energy release and thermally activated shape-memory polymers (SMPs). Validation against experimental data for elastic deployment demonstrates that the model accurately captures fold trajectories and overall kinematics. Parametric studies reveal the influence of hinge stiffness and damping on deployment efficiency. SMP-based simulations qualitatively reproduce stress-strain-temperature behaviour and realistic shape recovery ratios. The study establishes that predictive numerical models can effectively guide the design of origami-based deployable structures for aerospace and defence applications, while highlighting the challenges associated with hinge modelling, damping effects, and thermomechanical actuation.</description>

      <title>Flow Coupling Alters Topological Phase Transition in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how coupling to fluid flow influences defect-mediated transitions in two-dimensional passive nematic fluids using fluctuating nematohydrodynamic simulations. The system is driven by tuning the fluctuation strength, with increasing (decreasing) fluctuations defining the forward (backward) protocol. In the absence of flow coupling, the transition follows the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) scenario, governed by reversible binding and unbinding of $\pm 1/2$ defect pairs. When hydrodynamics is included, the outcome is controlled by the flow--alignment parameter. For non-aligning nematics ($\lambda=0$), the transition remains consistent with BKT. By contrast, for strain-rate--aligning nematics ($\lambda\neq 0$), bend--splay walls emerge, lowering the defect nucleation threshold and preventing sustained recombination: once created, defects remain unbound across the full range of fluctuation strengths in both forward and backward protocols. These results identify flow alignment as a fundamental control parameter for topological phase behavior and suggest that the canonical BKT transition emerges only in the absence of flow alignment.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of individual active elastic filaments with chiral self-propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the over-damped dynamics of individual one-dimensional elastic filaments subjected to a chiral active force which propels each point of the filament at a fixed angle relative to the tangent vector of the filament at that point. Such a model is a reasonable starting point for describing the behavior of polymers such as microtubules in gliding assay experiments. We derive sixth-order nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the intrinsic properties of the filament, namely, its curvature and metric, and show that these equations are capable of supporting multiple different stationary solutions in a co-moving frame, i.e. that chiral active elastic filaments exhibit dynamic multi-stability in their shapes. A linear stability analysis of these solutions is carried out to determine which solutions are stable and a brief analysis of the time-dependent approach to stationary shape is considered. Finally, simulations are presented which confirm many of our predictions while also revealing additional complexity.</description>

      <title>Impact of protein corona morphology on nanoparticle diffusion in biological fluids: insights from a mesoscale approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate considerable potential in medical applications, including targeted drug delivery and diagnostic probes. However, their efficacy depends on their ability to navigate through the complex biological environments inside living organisms. In such environments, NPs interact with a dense mixture of biomolecules, which can reduce their mobility and hinder diffusion. Understanding the factors influencing NP diffusion in these environments is key to improving nanomedicine design and predicting toxicological effects. In this study, we propose a computational approach to model NP diffusion in crowded environments. We introduce a mesoscale model that accounts for the combined effects of the Protein Corona (PC) and the crowded medium on NP movement. By including volume-exclusion interactions and modelling the PC both explicitly and implicitly, we identify key macromolecular descriptors that affect NP diffusion. Our results show that the morphology of the PC can significantly affect the diffusion of NPs, and the role of the occupied volume fraction and the size ratio between tracers and crowders are analysed. The results also show that approximating large macromolecular assemblies with a hydrodynamic single-sphere model leads to inexact diffusion estimates. To overcome the limitations of single-sphere representations, a strategy for an accurate parametrization of NP-PC systems using a single-sphere model is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Fields Method-Genetic Algorithm (VFM-GA) calibration framework for isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models with application to an elastomeric foam material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial particles (IPs) in vortical fluid flow cluster strongly, forming singular structures termed caustics for their resemblance to focal surfaces in optics. Here we show that such extreme aggre- gation onto low-dimensional submanifolds can arise without mechanical inertia for self-propelled particles (SPPs), through a formal correspondence between the dynamics of IPs and SPPs in a generic background flow. We establish that a singular perturbation underlies caustics formation by SPPs around a single vortex, and numerical studies of SPPs in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence reveal intense caustics in straining regions of the flow, peaking at intermediate levels of self-propulsion. Our work offers a route to singularly high local concentrations in a macroscopically dilute suspension of zero-Reynolds-number swimmers. Caustics generate burst-like encounters through large relative velocities between neighboring swimmers, with potentially significant implications for communication and sexual reproduction. An intriguing open direction is whether the active turbulence of a suspension of swimming microbes could serve to generate caustics in its own concentration</description>

      <title>Revealing the Geometrical and Vibrational Properties of the Defects Driving the Boson Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In amorphous solids, the vibrational density of states shows an excess of modes over the Debye model, known as the boson peak, whose origin remains unclear. Studies suggest a link to quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations or 'defects,' but identifying them is challenging due to hybridization with phonons that renders methods based on localization properties, such as the participation ratio, unreliable. We introduce a practical method to separate hybridized phonons from localized vibrations and find that boson peak phonons hybridize with compact, two-dimensional defects exhibiting oscillatory pure shear deformations. These two-dimensional defects are also exposed by the procedure recently employed to identify stringlets (Nature Physics volume 18, pages 669-677 (2022)), suggesting that these may not be one-dimensional objects as speculated. Our work demonstrates the presence of localized defects at the boson peak frequency and provides a comprehensive characterization of their vibrational and geometric properties, resolving the tension between the concepts of quasi-localized quadrupolar defects and stringlets.</description>

      <title>Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field</title>

Abstract: The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking into account the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy delivery with bistable nanostructures</title>

Abstract: Countless biological processes are fueled by energy-rich molecules like ATP and GTP that supply energy with extreme efficiency. However, designing similar energy-delivery schemes from the bottom up, essential for the development of powered nanostructures and other {\it de novo} machinery, presents a significant challenge: how can an energy-rich structure be stable in solution yet still deliver this energy at precisely the right time? In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.</description>

      <title>Topological phases in discrete stochastic systems</title>

Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <title>A microscopically reversible kinetic theory of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.</description>
