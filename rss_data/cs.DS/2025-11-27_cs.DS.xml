      <title>Exploiting Low Scanwidth to Resolve Soft Polytomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks allow modeling reticulate evolution, capturing events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. A fundamental computational problem in this context is the Tree Containment problem, which asks whether a given phylogenetic network is compatible with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the classical statement of the problem is not robust to poorly supported branches in biological data, possibly leading to false negatives. In an effort to address this, a relaxed version that accounts for uncertainty, called Soft Tree Containment, has been introduced by Bentert, Mal\'ik, and Weller [SWAT'18]. We present an algorithm that solves Soft Tree Containment in $2^{O(\Delta_T \cdot k \cdot \log(k))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k = \operatorname{sw}(\Gamma) + \Delta_N$, with $\Delta_T$ and $\Delta_N$ denoting the maximum out-degrees in the tree and the network, respectively, and $\operatorname{sw}(\Gamma)$ denoting the ``scanwidth'' [Berry, Scornavacca, and Weller, SOFSEM'20] of a given tree extension of the network, while $n$ is the input size. Our approach leverages the fact that phylogenetic networks encountered in practice often exhibit low scanwidth, making the problem more tractable.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Time Algorithm for the Maximum-Weight $(k, \ell)$-Sparse Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable.
  We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Time Low-Rank Approximation of Hankel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hankel matrices are an important class of highly-structured matrices, arising across computational mathematics, engineering, and theoretical computer science. It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\|H-H_k\|_F \leq \epsilon \|H\|_F$ for $k = O(\log n \log(1/\epsilon))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\polylog(n, 1/\epsilon)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\log n \log(1/\epsilon))$ Hankel matrix $\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\|H - \widehat{H}\|_F \leq O(\|E\|_F) + \epsilon \|H\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a subsampling method for topological data analysis based on strong collapses of simplicial complexes. Given a point cloud and a scale parameter $\delta$, we construct a subsampling that preserves both global and local topological features while significantly reducing computational complexity of persistent homology calculations. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, showing improved persistence approximations compared to other subsampling techniques.</description>

      <title>The communication complexity of distributed estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extension of the standard two-party communication model in which Alice and Bob hold probability distributions $p$ and $q$ over domains $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Their goal is to estimate \[ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p,\, y \sim q}[f(x, y)] \] to within additive error $\varepsilon$ for a bounded function $f$, known to both parties. We refer to this as the distributed estimation problem. Special cases of this problem arise in a variety of areas including sketching, databases and learning. Our goal is to understand how the required communication scales with the communication complexity of $f$ and the error parameter $\varepsilon$.
  The random sampling approach -- estimating the mean by averaging $f$ over $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ random samples -- requires $O(R(f)/\varepsilon^2)$ total communication, where $R(f)$ is the randomized communication complexity of $f$. We design a new debiasing protocol which improves the dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ to be linear instead of quadratic. Additionally we show better upper bounds for several special classes of functions, including the Equality and Greater-than functions. We introduce lower bound techniques based on spectral methods and discrepancy, and show the optimality of many of our protocols: the debiasing protocol is tight for general functions, and that our protocols for the equality and greater-than functions are also optimal. Furthermore, we show that among full-rank Boolean functions, Equality is essentially the easiest.</description>

      <title>Cycle Cancellation for Submodular Fractional Allocations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete allocation problem where $m$ indivisible goods are to be divided among $n$ agents. When agents' valuations are additive, the well-known cycle cancelling lemma by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos plays a key role in design and analysis of rounding algorithms.
  In this paper, we prove an analogous lemma for the case of submodular valuations. Our algorithm removes cycles in the support graph of a fractional allocation while guaranteeing that each agent's value, measured using the multilinear extension, does not decrease.
  We demonstrate applications of the cycle-canceling algorithm, along with other ideas, to obtain new algorithms and results for three well-studied allocation objectives: max-min (Santa Claus problem), Nash social welfare (NSW), and maximin-share (MMS). For the submodular NSW problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{5}$-approximation; for the MMS problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e)$-approximation through new simple algorithms. For various special cases where the goods are "small" valued or the number of agents is constant, we obtain tight/best-known approximation algorithms. All our results are in the value-oracle model.</description>

      <title>Space Complexity of Vertex Connectivity Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-vertex connectivity oracle for undirected $G$ is a data structure that, given $u,v\in V(G)$, reports $\min\{k,\kappa(u,v)\}$, where $\kappa(u,v)$ is the pairwise vertex connectivity between $u,v$. There are three main measures of efficiency: construction time, query time, and space. Prior work of Izsak and Nutov shows that a data structure of total size $\tilde{O}(kn)$ can even be encoded as a $\tilde{O}(k)$-bit labeling scheme so that vertex-connectivity queries can be answered in $\tilde{O}(k)$ time. The construction time is polynomial, but unspecified.
  In this paper we address the top three complexity measures: Space, Query Time, and Construction Time. We give an $\Omega(kn)$-bit lower bound on any vertex connectivity oracle. We construct an optimal-space connectivity oracle in max-flow time that answers queries in $O(\log n)$ time, independent of $k$.</description>

      <title>Superiority of Instantaneous Decisions in Thin Dynamic Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic matching setting where homogeneous agents arrive at random according to a Poisson process and randomly form edges yielding a sparse market. Agents stay in the market according to a certain sojourn time and wait to be matched with a compatible agent by a matching algorithm. When their maximum sojourn time is reached, they perish unmatched. The primary objective is to maximize the number of matched agents. Our main result is to show that a uniformly guaranteed sojourn time suffices to get almost optimal performance of instantaneous matching. Interestingly, this matching policy essentially keeps as few agents in the market as possible. Hence, in contrast to the common paradigm that market thickness is the crucial property for obtaining strong matching performance, we show that the agents' sojourn behavior can be an equally powerful factor. In addition, instantaneous matching is close to optimal with respect to minimizing waiting time. We develop new techniques for proving our results going beyond commonly adopted methods for Markov processes.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Distance-$r$ Dominating Set Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed integer $r \geq 1$, a distance-$r$ dominating set (D$r$DS) of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a vertex subset $D \subseteq V$ such that every vertex in $V$ is within distance $r$ from some member of $D$. Given two D$r$DSs $D_s, D_t$ of $G$, the Distance-$r$ Dominating Set Reconfiguration (D$r$DSR) problem asks if there is a sequence of D$r$DSs that transforms $D_s$ into $D_t$ (or vice versa) such that each intermediate member is obtained from its predecessor by applying a given reconfiguration rule exactly once. The problem for $r = 1$ has been well-studied in the literature. We consider D$r$DSR for $r \geq 2$ under two well-known reconfiguration rules: Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$, which involves replacing a member of the current D$r$DS by a non-member) and Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$, which involves replacing a member of the current D$r$DS by an adjacent non-member).
  It is known that under any of $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$, the problem on split graphs is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $r = 1$. We show that for $r \geq 2$, the problem is in $\mathtt{P}$, resulting in an interesting complexity dichotomy. Along the way, we prove some non-trivial bounds on the length of a shortest reconfiguration sequence on split graphs when $r = 2$ which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we design a linear-time algorithm under $\mathsf{TJ}$ on trees. On the negative side, we show that D$r$DSR for $r \geq 1$ on planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete, improving the degree bound of previously known results. We also show that the known $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-completeness results under $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$ for $r = 1$ on bipartite graphs and chordal graphs can be extended for $r \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Spanning Tree Congestion using Hereditary Bisection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Spanning Tree Congestion (STC) problem is the following NP-hard problem: given a graph $G$, construct a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ minimizing its maximum edge congestion where the congestion of an edge $e\in T$ is the number of edges $uv$ in $G$ such that the unique path between $u$ and $v$ in $T$ passes through $e$; the optimal value for a given graph $G$ is denoted $STC(G)$.
  It is known that every spanning tree is an $n/2$-approximation for the STP problem. A long-standing problem is to design a better approximation algorithm. Our contribution towards this goal is an $O(\Delta\cdot\log^{3/2}n)$-approximation algorithm where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in $G$ and $n$ the number of vertices. For graphs with a maximum degree bounded by a polylog of the number of vertices, this is an exponential improvement over the previous best approximation.
  Our main tool for the algorithm is a new lower bound on the spanning tree congestion which is of independent interest. Denoting by $hb(G)$ the hereditary bisection of $G$ which is the maximum bisection width over all subgraphs of $G$, we prove that for every graph $G$, $STC(G)\geq \Omega(hb(G)/\Delta)$.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets in the (in)comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal transversals in a hypergraph is a notoriously hard problem. It can be reduced to enumerating minimal dominating sets in a graph, in fact even to enumerating minimal dominating sets in an incomparability graph. We provide an output-polynomial time algorithm for incomparability graphs whose underlying posets have bounded dimension. Through a different proof technique, we also provide an output-polynomial algorithm for their complements, i.e., for comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets.
  Our algorithm for incomparability graphs is based on flashlight search and relies on the geometrical representation of incomparability graphs with bounded dimension, as given by Golumbic et al. in 1983. It runs with polynomial delay and only needs polynomial space. Our algorithm for comparability graphs is based on the flipping method introduced by Golovach et al. in 2015. It performs in incremental-polynomial time and requires exponential space.
  In addition, we show how to improve the flipping method so that it requires only polynomial space. Since the flipping method is a key tool for the best known algorithms enumerating minimal dominating sets in a number of graph classes, this yields direct improvements on the state of the art.</description>

      <title>A Catalyst Framework for the Quantum Linear System Problem via the Proximal Point Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem, but it can be computationally intensive for classical algorithms in high dimensions. Existing quantum algorithms can achieve exponential speedups for the quantum linear system problem (QLSP) in terms of the problem dimension, but the advantage is bottlenecked by condition number of the coefficient matrix. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for QLSP inspired by the classical proximal point algorithm (PPA). Our proposed method can be viewed as a meta-algorithm that allows inverting a modified matrix via an existing \texttt{QLSP\_solver}, thereby directly approximating the solution vector instead of approximating the inverse of the coefficient matrix. By carefully choosing the step size $\eta$, the proposed algorithm can effectively precondition the linear system to mitigate the dependence on condition numbers that hindered the applicability of previous approaches. Importantly, this is the first iterative framework for QLSP where a tunable parameter $\eta$ and initialization $x_0$ allows controlling the trade-off between the runtime and approximation error.</description>

      <title>Quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs, and more particularly in the unidirectional model, where the algorithm is allowed to query only the outgoing edges of a vertex. In the classical unidirectional model, the problem of testing $k$-star-freeness, and more generally $k$-source-subgraph-freeness, is almost maximally hard for large $k$. We prove that this problem has almost quadratic advantage in the quantum setting. Moreover, we show that this advantage is nearly tight, by showing a quantum lower bound using the method of dual polynomials on an intermediate problem for a new, property testing version of the $k$-collision problem that was not studied before.
  To illustrate that not all problems in graph property testing admit such a quantum speedup, we consider the problem of $3$-colorability in the related undirected bounded-degree model, when graphs are now undirected. This problem is maximally hard to test classically, and we show that also quantumly it requires a linear number of queries.</description>

      <title>Approximately Bisubmodular Regret Minimization in Billboard and Social Media Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing regret in multi-mode advertisement settings, where an influence provider allocates advertising resources such as social network seeds and billboard slots to multiple advertisers with specified influence demands and payments. Unlike prior work focusing on a single mode of advertising, we consider the interplay between online and offline modes and introduce a novel regret model that captures their interaction effect. This leads to a regret minimization problem that is non-monotone, non-submodular, and NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor. To address this, we propose a monotone, approximately bisubmodular influence model and develop two algorithmic solutions: Projected Subgradient Method based on the Lov\'asz extension of the regret function, and an Approximate Bisubmodular Local Search algorithm with provable guarantees. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, including billboard and trajectory data from major U.S. cities, as well as social network graphs, demonstrate that our methods outperform existing baselines in minimizing total regret while satisfying advertiser demands. Our framework is broadly applicable to other resource allocation scenarios beyond advertising.</description>
