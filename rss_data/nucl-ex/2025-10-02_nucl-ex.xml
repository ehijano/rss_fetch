      <title>High-spin spectroscopy and the onset of quasicollective structures in $^{69}$Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermediate- and high-spin level structure of the odd-$A$ $^{69}$Ga nucleus was investigated via the $^{26}$Mg($^{48}$Ca, $p4n\gamma$) fusion evaporation reaction at a beam energy of 195 MeV. The experiment was performed using the Gammasphere multidetector array in conjunction with the Fragment Mass Analyzer (FMA), with mass and charge identification achieved via an ionization chamber placed at the focal plane of the spectrometer. Coincidence relationships between the $^{69}$Ga reaction products and emitted $\gamma$ rays were analyzed to establish the level sequences, while angular distribution and angular correlation measurements were used to propose spin and parity assignments. As a result, the level scheme of the nucleus has been considerably extended. Near the ground state, the structure of $^{69}$Ga is well described by single-particle excitations, with shell-model calculations using the JUN45 and jj44b effective interactions providing a satisfactory interpretation of the observed levels. At spins in excess of 21/2 $\hbar$, three sequences of $E2$ transitions have been delineated, suggesting the onset of collectivity. An interpretation within the framework of the tilted-axis-cranking covariant density functional theory is proposed which reveals the role of $g_{9/2}$ protons and neutrons in this angular momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Study of the $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na reaction at LUNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NeNa-MgAl cycles are involved in the synthesis of Ne, Na, Mg, and Al isotopes. The $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na (Q = 2431.68 keV) reaction is the first and slowest reaction of the NeNa cycle and it controls the speed at which the entire cycle proceeds. At the state of the art, the uncertainty on the 20Ne(p,{\gamma})21Na reaction rate affects the production of the elements in the NeNa cycle. In particular, in the temperature range from 0.1 GK to 1 GK, the rate is dominated by the 366 keV resonance corresponding to the excited state of EX = 2797.5 keV and by the direct capture component. The present study focus on the study of the 366 keV resonance and the direct capture below 400 keV. At LUNA (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) the $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na reaction has been measured using the intense proton beam delivered by the LUNA 400 kV accelerator and a windowless differential-pumping gas target. The products of the reaction are detected with two high-purity germanium detectors. The experimental details and preliminary results on the 366 keV resonance and on the direct capture component at very low energies will be shown, together with their possible impact on the $^{20}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{21}$Na reaction rate.</description>

      <title>Status and future directions for direct cross-section measurements of the 13C(a,n)16O reaction for astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 13C(a,n)16O reaction is the main neutron source of the s-process taking place in thermally pulsing AGB stars and it is one of the main candidate sources of neutrons for the i-process in the astrophysical sites proposed so far. Therefore, its rate is crucial to understand the production of the nuclei heavier than iron in the Universe. For the first time, the LUNA collaboration was able to measure the 13C(a,n)16O cross section at Ec.m.=0.23-0.3 MeV drastically reducing the uncertainty of the S(E)-factor in the astrophysically relevant energy range. In this paper, we provide details and critical thoughts about the LUNA measurement and compare them with the current understanding of the 13C(a,n)16O reaction in view of future prospect for higher energy measurements. The two very recent results (from the University of Notre Dame and the JUNA collaboration) published after the LUNA data represent an important step forward. There is, however, still room for a lot of improvement in the experimental study of the 13C(a,n)16O reaction, as emphasized in the present manuscript. We conclude that to provide significantly better constraints on the low-energy extrapolation, experimental data need to be provided over a wide energy range, which overlaps with the energy range of current measurements. Furthermore, future experiments need to focus on the proper target characterisation, the determination of neutron detection efficiency having more nuclear physics input, such as angular distribution of the 13C(a,n)16O reaction below Ea&lt;0.8 MeV and study of nuclear properties of monoenergetic neutron sources and/or via the study of sharp resonances of 13C(a,n)16O. Moreover, comprehensive, multichannel R-matrix analysis with a proper estimate of uncertainty budget of experimental data are still required.</description>

      <title>Probing cold nuclear matter with energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future electron-ion collider (EIC) will produce the first-ever high energy collisions between electrons and a wide range of nuclei, opening a new era in the study of cold nuclear matter. Quarks and gluons produced in these collisions will propagate through the dense nuclear matter of nuclei, imprinting its structure into subtle correlations in the energy flux of final state hadrons. In this article, we apply recent developments from the field of jet substructure, namely the energy correlator observables, to decode these correlations and provide a new window into nuclear structure. The energy correlators provide a calibrated probe of the scale dependence of vacuum quantum chromodynamics (QCD), enabling medium modifications to be imaged and interpreted as a function of scale. Using the eHIJING parton shower to simulate electron-nucleus collisions, we demonstrate that the size of the nucleus is imprinted as an angular scale in the correlators, with a magnitude that is visible for realistic EIC kinematics. We can observe the size difference between the proposed EIC nuclear targets ${}^3$He, ${}^4$He, ${}^{12}$C, ${}^{40}$Ca, ${}^{64}$Cu, ${}^{197}$Au, and ${}^{238}$U, showing that the energy correlators can image femtometer length scales using asymptotic energy flux. Our approach offers a unified view of jet substructure across collider experiments, and provides numerous new theoretical tools to unravel the complex dynamics of QCD in extreme environments, both hot and cold.</description>

      <title>Chirality in $(\vec{p},2p)$ reactions induced by proton helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that longitudinally-polarized protons can be used to induce chirality in final states of the $(\vec{p},pN)$ reaction at intermediate energies, when there exist three final-state particles with non-coplanar momentum vectors. The analyzing power $A_z$ is proposed as a measure of this effect. Theoretical descriptions to obtain $A_z$ based on an intuitive picture as well as a distorted wave impulse approximation are presented, showing that the helicity of incident protons is coupled to the chirality of the orbital motion of a single-particle wave function, resulting in the chirality of the final states and a large $A_z$ value.</description>

      <title>Impact of embedded $^{163}$Ho on the performance of the transition-edge sensor microcalorimeters of the HOLMES experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the performance of transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters with $^{163}$Ho atoms embedded by ion implantation, as part of the HOLMES experiment aimed at neutrino mass determination. The inclusion of $^{163}$Ho atoms introduces an excess heat capacity due to a pronounced Schottky anomaly, which can affect the detector's energy resolution, signal height, and response time. We fabricated TES arrays with varying levels of $^{163}$Ho activity and characterized their performance in terms of energy resolution, decay time constants, and heat capacity. The intrinsic energy resolution was found to degrade with increasing $^{163}$Ho activity, consistent with the expected scaling of heat capacity. From the analysis, we determined the specific heat capacity of $^{163}$Ho to be $(2.9 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.7 \mathrm{(sys)})$ J/K/mol at $(94 \pm 1)$\,mK, close to the literature values for metallic holmium. No additional long decay time constants correlated with $^{163}$Ho activity were observed, indicating that the excess heat capacity does not introduce weakly coupled thermodynamic systems. These results suggest that our present TES microcalorimeters can tolerate $^{163}$Ho activities up to approximately 5 Bq without significant performance degradation. For higher activities, reducing the TES transition temperature is necessary to maintain energy resolution. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing TES microcalorimeters for future neutrino mass experiments and other applications requiring embedded radioactive sources. The study also highlights the robustness of TES technology in handling implanted radionuclides while maintaining high-resolution performance.</description>
