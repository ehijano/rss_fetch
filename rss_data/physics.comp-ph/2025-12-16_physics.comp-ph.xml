      <title>HWF-PIKAN: A Multi-Resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for solving Collisionless Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more recently Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) have emerged as promising approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without reliance on extensive labeled data. In this work, we propose a novel multi-resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier-Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HWF-PIKAN) for solving advection problems based on collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) with both continuous and discontinuous initial conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed. This study highlights the power of multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings in advancing physics-informed deep learning frameworks for complex kinetic equations in both space-time and phase-space.</description>

      <title>Numerical Assessment of Advective and Diffusive Dynamics of Interacting and Isolated Prototypical Convectively Initiated Circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk circulation associated with convective clouds includes not only a region of updraft and cloudy air but also a region of compensating descent and cloud-free air and horizontal motions coupling these regions. The Kinematic Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model is a simple representation of this entire flow. First, the skill of the KRoNUT in representing flows from a high resolution full-physics simulation of marine tropical convection is compared to various plume representations of convection. Then the KRoNUT is used to construct bulk descriptions of the dry dynamics of isolated and interacting convective circulations under the influence of advection and diffusion (only). Cross sections of advective and diffusive tendencies show that while vertical advection of the vertical wind is the most important advective tendency in clouds, the horizontal component of the convective circulation and advection thereof plays a crucial role in the evolution of circulations in the absence of buoyancy. Strong curvature of the flow near the surface and near the updraft core results in locally strong diffusive tendencies that depend on scale. Cross sections of tendencies from the KRoNUT compare favourably to results from the simulation. Interacting circulations are shown to exhibit a wide range of dynamics with some cases of interactions leading to unique stability of geometric properties of otherwise evolving flows and some leading to geometric clustering of circulation centers.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Cumulant Expansion and Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Weakly Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function of weakly interacting fermions with polynomial runtime in both the system size and precision. Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy landscape of the logarithmic potential: local minima and stationary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a detailed exploration of the energy landscape for configurations of points on the sphere, interacting via the logarithmic potential, and corresponding to local minima of the total energy, up to $N = 160$. The growth of $N_{\rm conf}$ (number of distinct configurations) is exponential, as for the Thomson problem, although weaker. Using the techniques described in our previous paper~\cite{Amore25} we have also explored the solution landscape of this problem for $N \leq 24$, and found that the number of stationary states is growing exponentially.</description>

      <title>Noise-robust Contrastive Learning for Critical Transition Detection in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting critical transitions in complex, noisy time-series data is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise.</description>

      <title>A Corrected Open Boundary Framework for Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a prominent approach for simulating multiphase flows, valued for its physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Thermal Conductivity Collapse in SWCNT Bundles: The Interplay of Symmetry Breaking and Scattering Revealed by Machine-Learning-Driven Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>3D lattice Monte Carlo modeling of morphology formation of Si/SiOx nanocomposites during phase separation of nonstoichiometric Si oxide films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x &lt; 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x &gt;= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x &lt;= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.</description>

      <title>A Joint Quantum Computing, Neural Network and Embedding Theory Approach for the Derivation of the Universal Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach that exploits the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning and reduced density matrix functional theory to leverage the potential of quantum computing to improve simulations of interacting quantum particles. Our method focuses on obtaining the universal functional using a deep neural network trained with quantum algorithms. We also use fragment-bath systems defined by density matrix embedding theory to strengthen our approach by substantially expanding the space of Hamiltonians for which the obtained functional can be applied without the need for additional quantum resources. Given the fact that once obtained, the same universal functional can be reused for any system where the interactions within the embedded fragment are identical, our work demonstrates a way to potentially achieve a cumulative quantum advantage within quantum computing applications for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Properties of Minimum Spanning Trees for Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-deviation properties of minimum spanning trees for two ensembles of random graphs with $N$ nodes. First, we consider complete graphs. Second, we study Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) random graphs with edge probability $p=c/N$ conditioned to be connected. By using large-deviation Markov chain sampling, we are able to obtain the distribution $P(W)$ of the spanning-tree weight $W$ down to probability densities as small as $10^{-300}$. For the complete graph, we confirm analytical predictions with respect to the expectation value. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For the connected ER graphs, we observe a remarkable change of the distributions at the value of $c=1$, which is the percolation threshold for the original ER ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of common intrinsic defects in CuInS$_2$ and CuGaS$_2$ using the Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional scheme. The impact of the two HSE parameters, $\alpha$ and $\omega$ on the band gap and compliance with the generalized Koopmans' theorem is investigated. Using the formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels, we assess the electronic properties of the defects and explore the connection of charge-transition levels with optical-transition levels. Calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission highlight the importance of lattice relaxation for the attribution of defects to luminescence peaks. Our results show that once these effects are included, predictions become closer to photoluminescence measurements available in literature.</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of circularly coiled optical slab waveguides, which is also applicable to acoustical waveguides. We use a change of variables and the classical Frobenius method to compute Bessel functions of complex order and complex argument, and combine it with a perfectly matched layer technique to solve the relevant Bessel eigenvalue problem and deliver accurate loss factors for eigensolutions to the three-layer optical slab waveguide problem. The solutions provide a benchmark for verifying model implementations of this problem and allow for a numerical verification of the Glazman criterion that provides a foundation for the well-posedness and stability analysis of homogeneous circular waveguides with impedance boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Neural equilibria for long-term prediction of nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Discrete Equilibrium (NeurDE), a machine learning framework for stable and accurate long-term forecasting of nonlinear conservation laws. NeurDE leverages a kinetic lifting that decomposes the dynamics into a fixed linear transport component and a local nonlinear relaxation to equilibrium. This structure provides a natural and principled interface between physics, numerical methods, and machine learning methodologies, enabling NeurDE to be viewed as a ``neural twin'' to Boltzmann-BGK. The transport step can be implemented efficiently in solvers such as lattice Boltzmann (LB), while the equilibrium is modeled by a neural network that maps macroscopic observables to a discrete equilibrium distribution. When integrated into a LB solver, the transport step becomes an efficient lattice streaming operation, and NeurDE yields a hybrid algorithm that robustly captures shock propagation and complex compressible dynamics over long time horizons. The NeurDE method is highly data-efficient: a small network trained on limited data generalizes far beyond the training regime, resolving shocks that evolve well outside the initial training distribution. Unlike traditional kinetic solvers, NeurDE achieves this accuracy without costly root-finding procedures or large velocity lattices. These results establish NeurDE as a scalable, efficient, and physics-informed paradigm for learning-based simulation of nonlinear conservation laws</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the Vielbein formalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The Vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the Cartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite polynomials. Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar coordinate $\theta$ , exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ finite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the north and south poles. We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and shear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shock wave and analyzing vortex dynamics on the spherical surface.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ans\"atze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Genuinely multi-dimensional stationarity preserving Finite Volume formulation for nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Finite Volume methods for multi-dimensional problems include stabilization (e.g.\ via a Riemann solver), that is derived by considering several one-dimensional problems in different directions. Such methods therefore ignore a possibly existing balance of contributions coming from different directions, such as the one characterizing multi-dimensional stationary states. Instead of being preserved, they are usually diffused away by such methods. Stationarity preserving methods use a better suited stabilization term that vanishes at the stationary state, allowing the method to preserve it. This work presents a general approach to stationarity preserving Finite Volume methods for nonlinear conservation/balance laws. It is based on a multi-dimensional stationarity preserving quadrature strategy that allows to naturally introduce genuinely multi-dimensional numerical fluxes. The new methods are shown to significantly outperform existing ones even if the latter are of higher order of accuracy and even on non-stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition Networks for Fast Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks in which CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$ CG paths into a single shared parameter set without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (\href{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMol/TDN}{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/}).</description>

      <title>A Note on the Convergence of Symmetric Triangle Quadrature Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric polynomial quadrature rules for triangles are commonly used to efficiently integrate two-dimensional domains in finite-element-type problems. While the development of such rules focuses on the maximum degree a given number of points can exactly integrate, smooth integrands are generally not polynomials of finite degree. Therefore, for such integrands, one needs to balance integration accuracy and computational cost. A natural approach to this balance is to choose the number of points such that the convergence rate with respect to the mesh size $h$ matches that of the other properties of the scheme, such as the planar or curved triangles that approximate the geometry or the basis functions that approximate the solution.
  In general, it is expected that a quadrature rule capable of integrating polynomials up to degree $d$ yields an integration error that is $\mathcal{O}(h^p)$, where $p=d+1$. However, as we describe in this paper, for symmetric triangle quadrature rules, when $d$ is even, $p=d+2$; therefore, for a $p^\text{th}$-order-accurate quadrature rule, fewer quadrature points are necessary, reducing the time required for matrix assembly in finite-element-type problems. This reduction in cost is modest for local differential operators that yield sparse matrices but appreciable for global integral operators that yield dense matrices.
  In this paper, we briefly summarize the details of symmetric triangle quadrature rules, discuss error implications for quadrature rules for one dimension and triangles, and we provide numerical examples that support our observation that polynomials that exactly integrate even maximum degrees converge faster than the conventional expectation for sequences of regular meshes.</description>

      <title>Shoot from the HIP: Hessian Interatomic Potentials without derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Using diffusion-based generative structure prediction and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we investigate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key mixed-anion decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and demonstrate that the amorphous counterpart is conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma \approx 0.18$ mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a} \approx 0.40$ eV. This enhancement stems from structural disorder flattening the Li site-energy landscape and a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We propose amorphous mixed-anion Li--P--O--F phases as a promising conducting medium in the SEI, offering a specific target for engineering improved battery interfaces.</description>

      <title>Efficient Boys function evaluation using minimax approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for efficient evaluation of Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{k_\mathrm{max}}$ tailored to modern computing architectures, in particular graphical processing units (GPUs), where maximum throughput is high and data movement is costly. The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm. For a target maximum absolute error of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol} = 5\cdot10^{-14}$, the corresponding approximation regions and coefficients for Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{32}$ are provided in the appendix.</description>
