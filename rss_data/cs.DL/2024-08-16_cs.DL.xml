      <title>A New Framework for Error Analysis in Computational Paleographic Dating of Greek Papyri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Greek papyri from ancient Egypt is fundamental for understanding Graeco-Roman Antiquity, offering insights into various aspects of ancient culture and textual production. Palaeography, traditionally used for dating these manuscripts, relies on identifying chronologically relevant features in handwriting styles yet lacks a unified methodology, resulting in subjective interpretations and inconsistencies among experts. Recent advances in digital palaeography, which leverage artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, have introduced new avenues for dating ancient documents. This paper presents a comparative analysis between an AI-based computational dating model and human expert palaeographers, using a novel dataset named Hell-Date comprising securely fine-grained dated Greek papyri from the Hellenistic period. The methodology involves training a convolutional neural network on visual inputs from Hell-Date to predict precise dates of papyri. In addition, experts provide palaeographic dating for comparison. To compare, we developed a new framework for error analysis that reflects the inherent imprecision of the palaeographic dating method. The results indicate that the computational model achieves performance comparable to that of human experts. These elements will help assess on a more solid basis future developments of computational algorithms to date Greek papyri.</description>

      <title>NeuroPapyri: A Deep Attention Embedding Network for Handwritten Papyri Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of computer vision and machine learning has emerged as a promising avenue for advancing historical research, facilitating a more profound exploration of our past. However, the application of machine learning approaches in historical palaeography is often met with criticism due to their perceived ``black box'' nature. In response to this challenge, we introduce NeuroPapyri, an innovative deep learning-based model specifically designed for the analysis of images containing ancient Greek papyri. To address concerns related to transparency and interpretability, the model incorporates an attention mechanism. This attention mechanism not only enhances the model's performance but also provides a visual representation of the image regions that significantly contribute to the decision-making process. Specifically calibrated for processing images of papyrus documents with lines of handwritten text, the model utilizes individual attention maps to inform the presence or absence of specific characters in the input image. This paper presents the NeuroPapyri model, including its architecture and training methodology. Results from the evaluation demonstrate NeuroPapyri's efficacy in document retrieval, showcasing its potential to advance the analysis of historical manuscripts.</description>
