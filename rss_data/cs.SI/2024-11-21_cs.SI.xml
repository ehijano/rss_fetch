      <title>Revisiting Fake News Detection: Towards Temporality-aware Evaluation by Leveraging Engagement Earliness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social graph-based fake news detection aims to identify news articles containing false information by utilizing social contexts, e.g., user information, tweets and comments. However, conventional methods are evaluated under less realistic scenarios, where the model has access to future knowledge on article-related and context-related data during training. In this work, we newly formalize a more realistic evaluation scheme that mimics real-world scenarios, where the data is temporality-aware and the detection model can only be trained on data collected up to a certain point in time. We show that the discriminative capabilities of conventional methods decrease sharply under this new setting, and further propose DAWN, a method more applicable to such scenarios. Our empirical findings indicate that later engagements (e.g., consuming or reposting news) contribute more to noisy edges that link real news-fake news pairs in the social graph. Motivated by this, we utilize feature representations of engagement earliness to guide an edge weight estimator to suppress the weights of such noisy edges, thereby enhancing the detection performance of DAWN. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAWN outperforms existing fake news detection methods under real-world environments.

      <title>Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</description>

      <title>Approximating Spatial Distance Through Confront Networks: Application to the Segmentation of Medieval Avignon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In historical studies, the older the sources, the more common it is to have access to data that are only partial, and/or unreliable or imprecise. This can make it difficult, or even impossible, to perform certain tasks of interest, such as the segmentation of some urban space based on the location of its constituting elements. Indeed, traditional approaches to tackle this specific task require knowing the position of all these elements before clustering them. Yet, alternative information is sometimes available, which can be leveraged to address this challenge. For instance, in the Middle Ages, land registries typically do not provide exact addresses, but rather locate spatial objects relative to each other, e.g. x being to the North of y. Spatial graphs are particularly adapted to model such spatial relationships, called confronts, which is why we propose their use over standard tabular databases. However, historical data are rich and allow extracting confront networks in many ways, making the process non-trivial. In this article, we propose several extraction methods and compare them to identify the most appropriate. We postulate that the best candidate must constitute an optimal trade-off between covering as much of the original data as possible, and providing the best graph-based approximation of spatial distance. Leveraging a dataset that describes Avignon during its papal period, we show empirically that the best results require ignoring some of the information present in the original historical sources, and that including additional information from secondary sources significantly improves the confront network. We illustrate the relevance of our method by partitioning the best graph that we extracted, and discussing its community structure in terms of urban space organization, from a historical perspective. Our data and source code are both publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Personal Networks of People Experiencing Homelessness in King County, WA with aggregate Relational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The social networks of people experiencing homelessness are an understudied but vital aspect of their lives, offering access to information, support, and safety. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported 653,100 people experiencing homelessness on any given night -- a 23% rise since 2022, though likely an undercount. This paper examines a unique three-year dataset (2022-2024) of survey responses from over 3,000 unhoused individuals in King County, WA, collected via network-based sampling methods to estimate the unsheltered population. Our study analyzes the networks of the unsheltered population, focusing on acquaintance, close friendship, kinship, and peer referral networks. Findings reveal a decline in social connectivity over time. The average number of acquaintances dropped from 80 in 2023 to 40 in 2024. Close friendship levels remained stable at 2.5, but given the growth in the homeless population, this suggests decreased network connectivity. Kinship networks expanded, indicating that more family members of unhoused individuals are also experiencing homelessness. These trends suggest increasing social disconnection, possibly driven by displacement and a rise in newly homeless individuals. The growing isolation may reduce opportunities for information sharing and mutual support. However, the increased reliance on family networks highlights the shifting dynamics of social support within this community. This research underscores the need for policies fostering social connections and community building, such as reducing displacement and providing spaces for congregation, to counter the growing anomie among unhoused populations.</description>

      <title>Suicide Risk Assessment on Social Media with Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With social media communities increasingly becoming places where suicidal individuals post and congregate, natural language processing presents an exciting avenue for the development of automated suicide risk assessment systems. However, past efforts suffer from a lack of labeled data and class imbalances within the available labeled data. To accommodate this task's imperfect data landscape, we propose a semi-supervised framework that leverages labeled (n=500) and unlabeled (n=1,500) data and expands upon the self-training algorithm with a novel pseudo-label acquisition process designed to handle imbalanced datasets. To further ensure pseudo-label quality, we manually verify a subset of the pseudo-labeled data that was not predicted unanimously across multiple trials of pseudo-label generation. We test various models to serve as the backbone for this framework, ultimately deciding that RoBERTa performs the best. Ultimately, by leveraging partially validated pseudo-labeled data in addition to ground-truth labeled data, we substantially improve our model's ability to assess suicide risk from social media posts.</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Labeled Datasets for Research on Information Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become a hub for political activities and discussions, democratizing participation in these endeavors. However, they have also become an incubator for manipulation campaigns, like information operations (IOs). Some social media platforms have released datasets related to such IOs originating from different countries. However, we lack comprehensive control data that can enable the development of IO detection methods. To bridge this gap, we present new labeled datasets about 26 campaigns, which contain both IO posts verified by a social media platform and over 13M posts by 303k accounts that discussed similar topics in the same time frames (control data). The datasets will facilitate the study of narratives, network interactions, and engagement strategies employed by coordinated accounts across various campaigns and countries. By comparing these coordinated accounts against organic ones, researchers can develop and benchmark IO detection algorithms.</description>
