      <title>Searching for screened scalar forces with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screened scalars are ubiquitous in many dark-sector models. They give rise to non-trivial fifth forces whilst evading experimental constraints through density-dependent screening mechanisms. We propose equipping a 10\,m-scale long-baseline atom interferometer with an annular planar source mass inside the vacuum chamber to search for such screened fifth forces. Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude. Our proposal is directly applicable to forthcoming experiments, such as AION-10 or VLBAI, and is readily extensible to broader theoretical models and longer baselines.</description>

      <title>Collisional and magnetic effects on the polarization of the solar oxygen infrared triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The scattering polarization of the infrared (IR) triplet of neutral oxygen (O\,\textsc{i}) near 777\,nm provides a powerful diagnostic of solar atmospheric conditions. However, interpreting such polarization requires a rigorous treatment of isotropic depolarizing collisions between O\,\textsc{i} atoms and neutral hydrogen.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the combined effects of collisional and magnetic depolarization in shaping the alignment of O\,\textsc{i} levels (and thus the polarization of the O\,\textsc{i} IR triplet).
  Methods: We compute, for the first time, a comprehensive set of collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the relevant O\,\textsc{i} energy levels. These rates are incorporated into a multi-level atomic model, and the statistical equilibrium equations (SEE) are solved to quantify the impact of collisions and magnetic fields on atomic alignment.
  Results: Our calculations indicate that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, together with the Hanle effect of turbulent magnetic fields stronger than about 20 G, efficiently suppress the bulk of the atomic alignment in deep photospheric conditions where hydrogen densities exceed $n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the chromosphere, however, the lower hydrogen density weakens collisional depolarization, allowing polarization to persist.
  Conclusions: Our results are consistent with a chromospheric origin for the linear polarization signals of the O I IR triplet. Future studies should combine accurate non-LTE radiative transfer with reliable collisional rates in order to achieve fully consistent modeling.</description>

      <title>Narrowline Laser Cooling and Spectroscopy of Molecules via Stark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic energy level structure of yttrium monoxide (YO) provides a long-lived, low-lying $^{2}\Delta$ state ideal for high-precision molecular spectroscopy, narrowline laser cooling at the single photon-recoil limit, and studying dipolar physics with unprecedented interaction strength. High-resolution laser spectroscopy of ultracold laser-cooled YO molecules is used to study the Stark effect in the A$^{\prime}\,^{2}\Delta_{3/2}\,J=3/2$ state. An immediate onset of the linear Stark effect is observed in the presence of weak applied electric fields due to the near degenerate $\Lambda$-doublet and the large electric dipole moment. By applying a small electric field the Stark insensitive state is spectroscopically isolated and the absolute transition frequency to the X$\,^2\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state is determined with a fractional frequency uncertainty of 9 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$. This electric field control is necessary to implement a quasi-closed photon cycling scheme that preserves parity. With this scheme the first narrowline laser cooling of a molecules is demonstrated, reducing the temperature of sub-Doppler cooled YO in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Chirped magneto-optical trap of molybdenum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have directly loaded a cryogenic beam of molybdenum atoms into a magneto-optical trap. By chirping the detuning of the trapping lasers, we were able to enhance the number of atoms loaded into the trap by more than a factor of two. We optimize the trapped samples for atom number, temperature, and lifetime by varying the laser-cooling parameters. The laser-cooled molybdenum atoms are subsequently transferred to a magnetic trap where we achieve vacuum-limited lifetimes of 100\,ms. Comparison of magneto-optical trap and magnetic trap lifetimes allow us to extract partial decay rates of the $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_4$ and $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_3$ transitions. We also provide measurements of the isotope shifts for the $\text{a}\,^7\text{S}_3\rightarrow \text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4$ transition with up to four times better precision than previously reported. Finally, we discuss the prospect of applying the chriped magneto-optical trap to produce laser-cooled samples of MgF.</description>

      <title>Tensor gravity gradiometry with a single-axis atom gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for using a single-axis atom interferometric gravity gradiometer to measure off-diagonal elements of the gravity gradient tensor. By tilting the gradiometer, the measured gradient becomes a linear combination of different components of the gravity gradient tensor, and through multiple measurements at different tilts the separate tensor components can be inferred. We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of this technique, both for terrestrial surveys where the tilt is statically set by the user and for surveys where a strapdown sensor is dynamically tilted by the motion of the platform. We show that the gradiometer's sensitivity to the vertical gravity gradient is only slightly reduced by this method while allowing for more gradiometer information to be obtained. Major sources of error and loss of sensitivity on dynamic platforms are shown to be mitigated using an optical-gimbal technique employing commercially-available fibre-optic gyroscopes and tip-tilt mirrors.</description>

      <title>User Manual for MOLSCAT, BOUND and FIELD, Version 2025.0: programs for quantum scattering properties and bound states of interacting pairs of atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.06755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MOLSCAT is a general-purpose package for performing non-reactive quantum scattering calculations for atomic and molecular collisions using coupled-channel methods. Simple atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collision types are coded internally and additional ones may be handled with plug-in routines. Plug-in routines may include external magnetic, electric or photon fields (and combinations of them). Simple interaction potentials are coded internally and more complicated ones may be handled with plug-in routines.
  BOUND is a general-purpose package for performing calculations of bound-state energies in weakly bound atomic and molecular systems using coupled-channel methods. It solves the same sets of coupled equations as MOLSCAT, and can use the same plug-in routines if desired, but with different boundary conditions.
  FIELD is a development of BOUND that locates external fields at which a bound state exists with a specified energy. One important use is to locate the positions of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance positions in ultracold collisions.

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics Approach for Extracting and Emulating Continuum Physics Based on Bound-State-Like Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified emulation framework for studying continuum physics in finite quantum systems. Using a reduced basis method, we construct powerful emulators for the inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation that operate in a combined parameter space of complex energy ($E$) and other inputs ($\bm{\theta}$). Within the space, the emulators simultaneously perform analytical continuation in $E$ -- extracting continuum physics from numerically simpler bound-state-like calculations -- and interpolate this entire process across $\bm{\theta}$. This yields a small, non-Hermitian system whose properties (e.g., resonances and scattering observables) can be rapidly predicted for any $\bm{\theta}$. Crucially, the complex-$E$ emulation provides a pathway to compute continuum observables for complex systems where advanced bound-state methods exist but direct continuum calculations are yet to be developed, while the $\bm{\theta}$-emulation enables rapid parameter-space exploration and can be adapted to accelerate other existing continuum calculations. Demonstrations with two- and three-body systems highlight the method's effectiveness and suggest its connection to (near-)optimal rational approximation. This Letter presents the key results, with further details reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: Detailed description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, I develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators rapidly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) across a parameter space that includes both complex energy and other real-valued physical inputs in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, one now has a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates those extractions in the input parameter space. Building on a prior Letter [\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309}{[arXiv:2408.03309}], this article provides the full theoretical details, a comprehensive analysis of the method's performance, and a brief discussion of how it can be coupled with existing continuum approaches to perform emulations in their input parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Peak Emission Rate and Time in Quantum Emitter Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</description>
