      <title>Layered automata: A canonical model for automata over infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce layered automata, a subclass of alternating parity automata that generalises deterministic automata. Assuming a consistency property, these automata are history deterministic and 0-1 probabilistic. We show that every omega-regular language is recognised by a unique minimal consistent layered automaton, and that this canonical form can be computed in polynomial time from every layered or deterministic automaton. We further establish that for layered automata both consistency checking and inclusion testing can be performed in polynomial time. Much like deterministic finite automata, minimal consistent layered automata admit a characterisation based on congruences.</description>

      <title>Systems of Graph Formulas and their Equivalence to Alternating Graph Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based modeling plays a fundamental role in many areas of computer science. In this paper, we introduce systems of graph formulas with variables for specifying graph properties; this notion generalizes the graph formulas introduced in earlier work by incorporating recursion. We show that these formula systems have the same expressive power as alternating graph automata, a computational model that extends traditional finite-state automata to graphs, and allows both existential and universal states. In particular, we provide a bidirectional translation between formula systems and alternating graph automata, proving their equivalence in specifying graph languages. This result implies that alternating graph automata can be naturally represented using logic-based formulations, thus bridging the gap between automata-theoretic and logic-based approaches to graph language specification.</description>

      <title>Fast Ramsey Quantifier Elimination in LIRA (with applications to liveness checking)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ramsey quantifiers have recently been proposed as a unified framework for handling properties of interests in program verification involving proofs in the form of infinite cliques, which are not expressible in first-order logic. Among others, these include liveness verification and monadic decomposability. We present the tool REAL, which implements an efficient elimination of Ramsey quantifiers in existential linear arithmetic theories over integers (LIA), reals (LRA), and the mixed case (LIRA). The tool supports a convenient input format, which is an extension of SMT-LIB over the aforementioned theories with Ramsey quantifiers. We also demonstrate a substantial speedup from the original prototype. As an application, we provide an automatic translation from FASTer (a tool for verifying reachability over infinite-state systems) output format to our extension of SMT-LIB and show how our tool extends FASTer to liveness checking.</description>

      <title>Monadic Context Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22431v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description>
