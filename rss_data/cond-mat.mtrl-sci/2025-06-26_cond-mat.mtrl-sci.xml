      <title>Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Anomalous Nernst Thermopower and Thermal Hall Angle in YbMnBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectrics (TEs) are solid-state devices that can realize heat-electricity conversion. Transverse TEs require materials with a large Nernst effect, which typically requires a strong applied magnetic field. However, topological materials with magnetic order offer an alternative pathway for achieving large Nernst via the anomalous Hall effect and the accompanying anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) that arise from band topology. Here, we show that YbMnBi2 with a low Hall density and a chemical potential near the Weyl points has, to the best of our knowledge, the highest ANE-dominated Nernst thermopower of any magnetic material, with $S_{yx}$ around 110 $\mu$V/K ($T$ = 254 K, 5 T &lt; $|\mu_0 H|$ &lt; 9 T applied along the spin canting direction), due to the synergism between classical contributions from filled electron bands, large Hall conductivity of topological origin, and large resistivity anisotropy. An appreciable thermal Hall angle of $0.02 &lt; (\nabla_y T)/(\nabla_x T) &lt; 0.06$ was observed (40 K &lt; $T$ &lt; 310 K, $\mu_0 H$ = 9 T).</description>

      <title>Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders and Emergence of Spin-Orbit Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism, a fundamental concept predating condensed matter physics, has achieved significant advancements in recent decades, driven by its potential for next-generation storage devices. Meanwhile, the classification of magnetic orders, even for the most fundamental concepts like ferromagnetism (FM) and antiferromagnetism (AFM), has encountered unprecedented challenges since the discovery of unconventional magnets and advancements in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we present a rigorous classification of magnetic order using state-of-the-art spin space group (SSG) theory. Based on whether the net magnetic moment is constrained to zero by SSG, magnetic order is unambiguously dichotomized into FM (including ferrimagnetism) and AFM. Additionally, we classify AFM geometries into four categories -- primary, bi-color, spiral, and multi-axial -- based on periodic spin propagation beyond the symmetry operations of magnetic space groups. We then introduce a distinct magnetic phase, dubbed spin-orbit magnetism, characterized by its unique behavior involving the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) order parameter and SOC-driven phase transition. We further create an oriented SSG description, i.e., SSG with a fixed magnetic configuration, apply the framework to 2,065 experimentally validated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA database, and identify over 220 spin-orbit magnets with distinct spin and orbital magnetization mechanisms. Implemented by the online program FINDSPINGROUP, our work establishes a universal symmetry standard for magnetic order classification, offering new understandings of unconventional magnets and broad applicability in spintronics and quantum material design.</description>

      <title>BaCd2P2: a defect-resistant "GaAs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has recently been identified as a promising solar absorber with excellent optoelectronic properties. Here we demonstrate the defect tolerance in BCP by comparing its optoelectronic quality with that of the well studied absorber GaAs. Despite having a low precursor purity, our synthesized BCP samples exhibit a bright band-to-band room-temperature photoluminescence intensity, an implied open-circuit voltage of 1.0 V at AM1.5, and a carrier lifetime of about 300 ns, all higher than those of GaAs samples obtained from a high-purity single-crystalline wafer. In contrast, GaAs samples synthesized using similar methods as BCP show no band-to-band photoluminescence emissions. To understand the higher optoelectronic quality of BCP, we perform first-principles defect calculations and show that BCP has a much lower Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination rate compared to GaAs. Our results reveal robust impurity and defect tolerance in BCP, demonstrating its high photovoltaic potential.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Machine-Learning Framework for Predicting Dislocation Plasticity and Stress-Strain Response in FCC Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model, trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Quantum Emission from Covalently Functionalized van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single photon emission (SPE) from atomic defects, primarily tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to yield high purity, deterministically positioned SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T&lt;30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (&gt;90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T=90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in a layered WSe2/graphite heterostructure maintains high purity up to T=90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T=115 K. This method preserves the best qualities of SPE from WSe2 while increasing working temperature to more than three times the typical range. This work demonstrates the versatility of surface functionalization and heterostructure design to synergistically improve the properties of quantum emission and offers new insights into the phenomenon of SPE from 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic conduction in copper-graphene composites with functional impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coal-derived graphene-like material and its addition to FCC copper are investigated using ab initio plane wave density functional theory (DFT). We explore ring disorder in the sp2 carbon, and functional impurities such as oxides (-O), and hydroxides (-OH) that are common in coal-derived graphene. The electronic density of states analysis revealed localized states near the Fermi level, with functional groups contributing predominantly to states below the Fermi level, while carbon atoms in non-hexagonal rings contributed mainly to states above it. The functionalization of graphene induces charge localization while ring disorder disrupts the continuous flow of electrons. By projecting the electronic conductivity along specific spatial directions, we find that both the crystal orientation and the graphene purity significantly influence the anisotropy and magnitude of electronic transport in the composites. This study implicitly highlights the importance of structural stress to obtain improved electrical conductivity in such composites.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Mapping of Magnetic Properties via the on-the-fly XMCD spectroscopy in a Combinatorial Fe-Co-Ni Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy was conducted on Fe-Co-Ni compositionally graded films to systematically analyze the variation of magnetic properties as a function of composition. On-the-fly XMCD measurement enabled rapid spectral acquisition. Measurement time was reduced approximately tenfold compared to conventional stepwise methods, while maintaining high precision. The obtained XMCD spectra were processed using the Savitzky-Golay denoising technique, and element-specific magnetic properties were extracted using XMCD sum rules. By mapping the orbital and spin magnetic moments across the composition gradient, we identified key regions exhibiting enhanced soft magnetic properties. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of high-throughput synchrotron-based spectroscopy for accelerating materials discovery and optimizing functional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>All-electric control of skyrmion-bimeron transition in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a versatile platform for manipulating atomic-scale topological spin textures. In this study, using first-principles and micromagnetic calculations, we demonstrate a reversible transition between magnetic skyrmions and bimerons in a MoTeI/In_2Se_3 multiferroic heterostructure. The physical origin lies in the reorientation of the easy axis of magnetic anisotropy, triggered by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. We show that the transition operates effectively under both static and dynamic conditions, exhibiting remarkable stability and flexibility. Notably, this transition can be achieved entirely through electric control, without requiring any external magnetic field. Furthermore, we propose a binary encoding scheme based on the skyrmion-bimeron transition, presenting a promising path toward energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable inroads have recently been made on algorithms to determine the sample potential from four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy data from thick samples where multiple scattering cannot be neglected. This paper further develops the scattering matrix approach to such structure determination. Through simulation, we demonstrate how this approach can be modified to better handle partial spatial coherence, unknown probe defocus, and information from the dark field region. By combining these developments we reconstruct the electrostatic potential of a monolithic SrTiO$_3$ crystal showing good quantitative agreement with the expected structure.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in 6 Angstrom-Thick Two-dimensional Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale ferroelectric thin films hold great promise for high-density, low-power applications but face stability and voltage scaling challenges at extreme thinness. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in single-crystalline two-dimensional (2D) Ga$_2$O$_3$, an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor, at just 6 angstrom thickness, exhibiting exceptional retention and thermal stability. We show that epitaxial beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can be exfoliated down to a half-unit cell thickness via a self-limiting mechanism, enabling a biaxial strain-induced phase transition into a novel ferroelectric layered structure. Strain modulation enables the reduction of polarization switching voltage to 0.8 V, meeting CMOS voltage scaling requirements. Theoretical calculations reveal that switching is driven by covalent bond reconstruction, effectively countering depolarization and enhancing stability. Additionally, we integrate ferroelectric 2D Ga$_2$O$_3$ onto silicon using a low-temperature, back-end-of-line-compatible process. This work advances the exploration of sub-nanometer ferroelectrics, paving the way for high-density, low-power, non-volatile applications seamlessly integrated with advanced silicon technology.</description>

      <title>Nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced hourglass fermions and Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction in BiInO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin texture of the hourglass fermions band network in BiInO$_3$ using density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry analysis. Hourglass fermions are of interest in spintronics due to their unique and robust band structure, as well as their potential applications in novel electronic devices. BiInO$_3$ exhibits non-symmorphic crystal symmetries, such as glide reflection and glide rotational symmetry, influencing its electronic properties. Through symmetry analysis, we explore the band crossings and spin textures along specific high-symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone. Our results reveal a fascinating hourglass-shaped band dispersion and spin polarisation governed by symmetry operations and spin-orbit interaction. We analyse the spin-splitting mechanisms, including Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, and suggest potential applications for spin-based devices. This study sheds light on the role of symmetry in crystals for fascinating spin properties of hourglass fermions in non-symmorphic materials, offering insights for future developments in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Band Structure Unfolding with Atomic-centered Orbitals: General Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the electrical impact of atomic carbon impurities in MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides, a family of two-dimensional compounds, are of interest for a range of technological applications. MoS2, the most researched member of this family, is hexagonal, from which monolayers may be isolated. Under ambient conditions and during growth/processing, contamination by impurities can occur, of which carbon is significant due to its presence in the common growth techniques. We have performed extensive computational investigations of carbon point defects, examining substitutional and interstitial locations. Previously unreported thermodynamically stable configurations, four-fold co-ordinated mono-carbon and di-carbon substitutions of Mo, and a complex of carbon substitution of sulfur bound to interstitial sulfur have been identified. We find no evidence to support recent assertions that carbon defects are responsible for electrical doping of MoS2, finding all energetically favorable forms have only deep charge transition levels and would act as carrier traps. To aid unambiguous identification of carbon defects, we present electronic and vibrational data for comparison with spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Electrical Characterization of hexagonal SiGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report electrical measurements on hexagonal silicon-germanium (hex-SiGe), a group IV alloy with direct bandgap. Electrical contacts are formed by metal alloying and doping is achieved using ion implantation. The metastable hex-SiGe phase is successfully recovered after implantation by solid phase recrystallization. Independent of the metal used, contacts on n-type resulted in Schottky barriers due to Fermi level pinning of hex-SiGe. Overall, this constitutes a first step towards use of hex-SiGe for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Confined acoustic phonons in CsPbI3 nanocrystals explored by resonant Raman scattering on excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical properties of the lead halide perovskites nanocrystals are controlled by confined excitons and rich spectrum of confined acoustic and optical phonons. We study experimentally and theoretically the exciton-phonon interaction in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Energies of phonon modes allowed by selection rules are detected by resonant Raman scattering for nanocrystals with sizes of 4-13 nm, covering exciton energies of 1.72-2.25 eV. While optical phonon energies remain size-independent, the energies of confined acoustic phonons increase in smaller nanocrystals. Acoustic phonons are modeled within the continuum approximation using elastic constants computed by density functional theory. The model provides the energy spectra of confined phonons for nanocrystals of various shapes (cube, sphere, spheroid), crystal symmetries (orthorhombic and tetragonal), and sizes. Exciton confinement restricts efficient coupling to only few phonon modes observable in Raman spectra. By comparing experimental data with model predictions, we conclude that the nanocrystals in our samples predominantly have spherical or spheroidal shapes.</description>

      <title>Wurtzite Boron Nitride as a potential defects host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite boron nitride (wBN) is a polymorph of boron nitride and serves as an intermediate phase in the transition from hBN to cBN under high pressure and temperature conditions. Owing to these extreme synthesis conditions, wBN likely inherits defects from hexagonal phase, where bright and stable single-photon emitters have been observed in both the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges. While hBN and cubic BN (cBN) have been extensively studied for hosting quantum emitters, wBN remains comparatively unexplored. In this work, we use first-principles hybrid DFT calculations to investigate the formation energies and electronic structures of key native point defects in wBN, including boron and nitrogen vacancies, antisites, and carbon impurities, across various charge states. Our results reveal the potential of wBN as a robust platform for optically active defects. These properties make it a promising candidate for quantum technologies operating under extreme conditions. This study lays the groundwork for future experimental efforts in defect identification and engineering in wBN.</description>

      <title>An analysis of derivative absorption spectroscopy of multiferroic bismuth ferrite materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) of bulk BiFeO3, nanostructured BiFeO$_3$, and thick film of BiFeO$_{2.85}$ were studied in detail based on their experimental absorption data. The goal of this study was to investigate the electronic transitions and the Urbach tail band in three samples of the magnetoelectric multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. The PDF and CDF functions were derived from the absorption data of these substances in the UV-visible-NIR region of light spectrum. For the BiFeO$_3$-based materials, charge transfer (p-d and/or p-p) transitions in the energy range of 2.5 eV to 5.5 eV were identified through PDF and CDF analysis. Furthermore, spin-orbit and electron-lattice interactions along with a low-symmetry crystal field cause two doubly degenerate d-d transitions of Fe$^{3+}$ ions in the FeO$_6$ octahedra of the BiFeO$_3$ samples to occur between 1.5 eV and 2.5 eV. Additionally, the BiFeO3-based materials exhibited strong direct and weak indirect transitions near the band edge, which point to a complex band structure of BiFeO$_3$. Finally, the energy of the defect-induced Urbach tail band was directly calculated by examining the CDF function of the materials, yielding estimated values of approximately 0.40 eV, 0.31 eV, and 0.33 eV for the bulk, nanostructured, and film BiFeO$_3$ samples, respectively.</description>

      <title>Diverse polymorphs and phase transitions in van der Waals In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals In$_2$Se$_3$ has garnered significant attention due to its unique properties and wide applications associated with its rich polymorphs and polymorphic phase transitions. Despite extensive studies, the vast complex polymorphic phase space remains largely unexplored, and the underlying microscopic mechanism for their phase transformations remains elusive. Here, we develop a highly accurate, efficient, and reliable machine-learning potential (MLP), which not only facilitates accurate exploration of the intricate potential energy surface (PES), but also enables us to conduct large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with first-principles accuracy. We identify the accurate structure of the $\beta''$ polymorph and uncover several previously unreported $\beta'$ polymorph variants exhibiting dynamic stability and competing energies, which are elucidated by characteristic flat imaginary phonon bands and the distinctive Mexican-hat-like PES in the $\beta$ polymorph. Through the MLP-accelerated MD simulations, we directly observe the polymorphic phase transformations among the $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\beta'$, and $\beta''$ polymorphs under varying temperature and pressure conditions, and build for the first time an ab initio temperature-pressure phase diagram, showing good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, our MD simulations reveal a novel strain-induced reversible phase transition between the $\beta'$ and $\beta''$ polymorphs. This work not only unveils diverse polymorphs in van der Waals In$_2$Se$_3$, but also provides crucial atomic insights into their phase transitions, opening new avenues for the design of novel functional electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of metallic glass as a grain-boundary nucleated process: experimental and theoretical evidence for the grain structure of metallic glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental DSC and Avrami curves for the crystallization of metallic glasses demonstrate nucleation at grain boundaries and thus indicate their grain structure, which refutes the generally accepted idea of glass as a homogeneous frozen liquid obtained as a result of avoiding crystallization. Under certain conditions, this nucleation mechanism results in the appearance of two-peak DSC curves and three-step Avrami plots which are observed experimentally. To clarify these conditions, isothermal and non-isothermal surface-nucleated crystallization of a spherical particle is considered within the framework of a simple analytical model of nucleation and growth.</description>

      <title>Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Additionally, we observe a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.</description>

      <title>Computational Design of Two-Dimensional MoSi$_2$N$_4$ Family Field-Effect Transistor for Future \AA ngstr\"om-Scale CMOS Technology Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology into the sub-1-nm angstr\"om-scale technology nodes is expected to involve alternative semiconductor channel materials, as silicon transistors encounter severe performance degradation at physical gate lengths below 10 nm. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angstr\"om-scale CMOS era.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast photocurrent detection reveals that device efficiency is dominated by ultrafast exciton dissociation not exciton diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons diffusing to a charge-separating interface is a necessary step to convert energy into current in next-generation photovoltaics. In this report, made possible by a new ultrafast spectrometer design, we compare exciton dynamics measured using both photoabsorption- and photocurrent-detected transient and 2D spectroscopies. For a device with semiconducting carbon nanotubes as the exciton transport material, we find that photoabsorption detection greatly overestimates the importance of long-lived excitons for device performance. Excitons diffuse and transfer between nanotubes for several picoseconds, but the large majority of photocurrent is created within 30fs by excitons that diffuse little to the C60 electron transfer material. These results change our understanding of the material features most important for these photovoltaics. Photoabsorption detection measures all excitons, but not all photogenerated excitons generate current. To understand device efficiency, this study points to the necessity for directly measuring the exciton dynamics responsible for photocurrent.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interaction, band topology, and spin texture in BiInO3(001) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the implication of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and symmetry on the band topology and spin texture at the (001) surface of BiInO$_3$. Using density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry analysis, the study explores the impact of surface termination on the electronic structure, particularly focusing on how the loss of translational symmetry at the surface influences the band topology of the surface states. Key findings include discovering two dangling surface states (named SS1 and SS2) with distinct spin textures. SS1 exhibits Rashba spin splitting due to surface inversion asymmetry, characterised by isotropic effective mass and tangential spin alignment on constant energy contours. In contrast, SS2 features a persistent spin Texture (PST) spin texture, a momentum-independent spin polarisation. The orbital contributions to these bands, dominated by specific s and p orbitals, dictate the direction and nature of the spin texture. This study highlights BIO's potential as a platform for spintronic applications, where control over spin textures and electronic properties at the surface can enable the design of advanced spin-based devices. The findings bridge the gap between symmetry-driven theoretical frameworks and practical material functionalities, offering insights into the interplay of surface symmetry, SOI, and band topology.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an electromagnetic instability in two-dimensional materials arising from an anisotropy of the Fermi surface, utilizing a kinetic model accounting for the effects of the values of temperature, chemical potential and anisotropy ratio, as well as considering both linear and quadratic low-energy band structures. The wavenumber-dependent growth-rate of these modes is derived in the linear regime, and their confinement, contrasting with stable electromagnetic waves in these systems, is described. The generation of structured out-of-plane magnetic fields, as well as their behaviour in saturation, is shown using fully kinetic and non-linear simulations.</description>

Abstract: Time-resolved ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (EUV) magnetic scattering is used to study laser-driven ultrafast magnetization dynamics of labyrinthine domains in a [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayer. Our measurements at the Co and Ni M-edges reveal distinct ultrafast distortions of the scattering pattern position and width for Ni compared to Co. Ni shows a strong modification of the scattering pattern, 9 to 41 times stronger than Co. As distortions of the labyrinthine pattern in reciprocal space relate to the modification of domain textures in real space, significant differences in Co and Ni highlight a 3D distortion of the domain pattern in the far-from-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Synergy of Rashba and Topological Effects for High-Performance Bismuth-Based Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band convergence is a key strategy for enhancing thermoelectric (TE) performance. Herein, we demonstrate a promising approach to enhance band convergence through inducing Rashba splitting in topological insulators. Theoretically designed Janus $\beta$-Bi$_2$Se$_2$Te and $\beta$-Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se exhibited inherent topological band inversion and Rashba splitting due to the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with broken inversion symmetry. These characteristics synergistically improve band convergence, leading to a substantially enhanced power factor. Meanwhile, the Janus structural asymmetry suppresses lattice thermal conductivity. Consequently, Janus structures achieve boosted TE performance, especially for $\beta$-Bi$_2$Se$_2$Te, peaking figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.82. This work establishes a new framework for designing Janus topological compounds with high TE performance by the synergistic effect of Rashba splitting and band inversion.</description>

      <title>Pull-off strength of mushroom-shaped fibrils adhered to rigid substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional adhesion properties of biological fibrillar structures -- such as those found in geckos -- have inspired the development of synthetic adhesive surfaces. Among these, mushroom-shaped fibrils have demonstrated superior pull-off strength compared to other geometries. In this study, we employ a computational approach based on a Dugdale cohesive zone model to analyze the detachment behavior of these fibrils when adhered to a rigid substrate. The results provide complete pull-off curves, revealing that the separation process is inherently unstable under load control, regardless of whether detachment initiates at the fibril edge or center. Our findings show that fibrils with a wide, thin mushroom cap effectively reduce stress concentrations and promote central detachment, leading to enhanced adhesion. However, detachment from the center is not observed in all geometries, whereas edge detachment can occur under certain conditions in all cases. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adhesion defects at the fibril center, showing that they can significantly reduce pull-off strength, particularly at high values of the dimensionless parameter \c{hi}. These insights contribute to the optimization of bio-inspired adhesives and microstructured surfaces for various engineering applications.</description>

      <title>From the dynamic to the static glass transition via hypersonic measurements using Brillouin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the fragile, low-molecular-weight liquid diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), we report on the dynamic glass transition and a further acoustic anomaly in the vicinity of the thermal glass transition based on hypersonic investigations of the longitudinal elastic modulus using Brillouin spectroscopy. This additional acoustic anomaly of the longitudinally polarized phonon is confirmed by the occurrence of an anomaly of the shear phonon at the same thermal glass transition temperature. Analysis of the generalized Cauchy relation suggests that both anomalies are coupled to a glass transition phenomenon independent of the so-called {\alpha}-relaxation process.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled BaBi$_3$ formed by \textit{in situ} reduction of bismuthate films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Eu metal and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, which leads to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu adlayer leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state is quasi-two-dimensional, as evidenced by the angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage characteristics. An in-plane upper critical field B$_{c2}$ significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit is observed, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity. The strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high-T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Electric field-induced clustering in nanocomposite films of highly polarizable inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nanocomposite film containing highly polarizable inclusions in a fluid background is explored when an external electric field is applied perpendicular to the planar film. For small electric fields, the induced dipole moments of the inclusions are all polarized in field direction, resulting in a mutual repulsion between the inclusions. Here we show that this becomes qualitatively different for high fields: the total system self-organizes into a state which contains both polarizations, parallel and antiparallel to the external field such that a fraction of the inclusions is counter-polarized to the electric field direction. We attribute this unexpected counter-polarization to the presence of neighboring dipoles which are highly polarized and locally revert the direction of the total electric field. Since dipoles with opposite moments are attractive, the system shows a wealth of novel equilibrium structures for varied inclusion density and electric field strength. These include fluids and solids with homogeneous polarizations as well as equilibrium clusters and demixed states with two different polarization signatures. Based on computer simulations of a linearized polarization model, our results can guide the control of nanocomposites for various applications, including sensing external fields, directing light within plasmonic materials, and controlling the functionality of biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Technique Characterization of Rhodium Gem-Dicarbonyls on TiO$_2$(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gem-dicarbonyls of transition metals supported on metal (oxide) surfaces are common intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis. While infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a standard tool for detecting these species on applied catalysts, the ill-defined crystallographic environment of species observed on powder catalysts renders data interpretation challenging. In this work, we apply a multi-technique surface science approach to investigate rhodium gem-dicarbonyls on a single-crystalline rutile TiO$_2$(110) surface. We combine spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to determine their location and coordination on the surface. IR spectroscopy shows the successful creation of gem-dicarbonyls on a titania single crystal by exposing deposited Rh atoms to CO gas, followed by annealing to 200-250 K. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) data reveal that these complexes are mostly aligned along the [001] crystallographic direction, corroborating theoretical predictions. Notably, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data reveal multiple rhodium species on the surface, even when the IR spectra show only the signature of rhodium gem-dicarbonyls. As such, our results highlight the complex behavior of carbonyls on metal oxide surfaces, and demonstrate the necessity of multi-technique approaches for the adequate characterization of single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic phonons via quantum thermal bath simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations within crystalline solids, or phonons, provide information on a variety of important material characteristics, from thermal qualities to optical properties and phase transition behaviour. When the material contains light ions, or is subjected to sufficiently low temperatures and/or high pressures, anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) may significantly alter its phonon characteristics. Unfortunately, accurate inclusion of these two effects within numerical simulations typically incurs a substantial computational cost. In this work, we present a novel approach which promises to mitigate this problem. The scheme leverages the recently introduced quantum correlators approach for the extraction of anharmonic phonon frequencies from molecular dynamics data. To account for NQEs without excessive increase of the computational cost, we include nuclear quantum effects via the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method. This is the first full exploration of the use of QTB for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations. We demonstrate the noteworthy efficiency and accuracy of the scheme, and analyze its upsides and drawbacks by first considering 1-dimensional systems, and then the physically interesting case of solid neon.</description>

      <title>Photocurrents induced by k-linear terms in semiconductors and semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a six-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ model to describe the electronic structure and optical response of chiral multifold semimetals, such as RhSi. By means of invariants method we construct the effective Hamiltonian describing the states near the $\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone where the spin-orbit coupling and $\mathbf{k}$-linear Rashba terms, which are crucial for circular photogalvanic effect, are taken into account. The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge. Our results provide an analytical framework for understanding the role of Rashba coupling and topology in the optoelectronic properties of multifold chiral semimetals.</description>

      <title>Optimal superconductivity near a Lifshitz transition in strained (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</description>

      <title>New plasmon-like mode in PdTe$_{2}$: Raman scattering and memory function study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PdTe$_2$ is a type II Dirac semimetal that has garnered significant attention due to its intriguing electronic and topological properties. Here, we report temperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak below 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a phonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional Theory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To ascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of electrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the memory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear in frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response from the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation rate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the congruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain that the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode. Further, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit anomalous behavior above 100 K.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves Approach to Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a new method for basis set generation for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids. This procedure is aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT). In this construction, Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the self consistent eigenstates of the final (converged) Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the self consistency iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, and augment it, inside each Muffin Tin (MT) sphere, with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window which contains the energy of that previous eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous break up the spectrum into non-overlapping intervals, windows, and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window per angular momentum channel (at the linearization energy relevant to that window, usually near the middle of the window). For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the EWAPW basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Thermoelectric Properties of Half-Heusler CoHfSi: A First-Principles Study with Temperature-Dependent Relaxation Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ongoing search for innovative thermoelectric (TE) materials with superior TE performance globally, we aim to investigate the possible use of half-Heusler alloy CoHfSi in TE applications. We analyzed the structure stability, thermodynamic inertia and electrical and thermal transport properties using density functional formalism and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Positive phonon frequencies confirm this alloy's dynamical stability, and the Born-Huang stability criterion is also satisfied, confirming the robust mechanical stability. A large Seebeck voltage of more than 150 {\mu}V/K is estimated, an essential and typical requirement for improved heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency. This Seebeck voltage can be further increased by an order of magnitude with suitable doping. The PHONO3PY algorithm and Slack's model are used to compare the lattice thermal conductivity. The latter method gives more values than the former algorithm. Despite the commonly used constant relaxation time approximation to estimate the TE performance, we adopt the temperature-dependent relaxation time and found a clear drop in figure-of merit (zT) from those estimated without considering the lattice thermal conductivity and relaxation time both, still, the zT values are remarkably more than two, for the temperatures above 500 K, which is a striking numeral in the field of TE materials.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption and luminescence of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction.
  The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$
  orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength.
  We relate this to a recent experimental study of
  cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic 2D materials have achieved significantly consideration owing to their encouraging applications. A variation of these 2D materials by occurrence of defects, by the transition-metal doping or adsorption or by the surface functionalization can initiate both the spin-polarization and magnetic properties in these materials. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to determine the electric, magnetic properties along with the electronic structures and stability of synthesized two-dimensional materials. This work describes the magnetic properties of Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF MXene. The study focuses on the computational approach based first principal calculation providing insight onto the magnetic properties of adsorbed compound and comparing it with pristine Nb2C-OF MXene. The pristine Nb2C-OF and Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF structures are simulated and optimized using Wien2k software. Using exchange-correlational functionals; spin-GGA and spin-GGA+U (for Nickel U= 6eV), Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF electronic band structure is found to be metallic having magnetic moment calculated +1.01516{\mu}_\b{eta} showing its non-superconducting and ferromagnetic behaviour. Owing to this magnetic nature, this 2D compound can be used for new upcoming applications such as spintronics and nano magnetic data storage devices.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic systems with noncentrosymmetric crystal structures are renowned for their complex magnetic ordering and diverse and fascinating physical properties. In this report, we provide a comprehensive study of the chiral magnetic system Ni$_2$ScSbO$_6$, which exhibits a robust incommensurate long-range antiferromagnetic spin ordering at a temperature of $T_N = 62$~K, as revealed by bulk magnetization, specific heat, and neutron diffraction studies. This magnetic ordering triggers a series of intriguing phenomena, including prominent magnetodielectric coupling manifested by a dielectric peak at $T_N$, significant spin-phonon coupling resulting in strong phonon renormalization characterized by anomalous softening of various Raman modes, and a remarkable volume magnetostriction effect probed by high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. These phenomena are intricately interlinked, positioning the present system as a rare and interesting material.</description>

      <title>TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks</title>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Due to their chemical diversity, MOFs can support a broad range of applications in chemical separations. However, the vast amount of structural compositions encoded in crystallographic information files complicates application-oriented, computational screening and design. The existing crystallographic data, therefore, requires augmentation by simulated data so that suitable descriptors for machine-learning and quantum computing tasks become available. Here, we provide extensive simulation data augmentation for MOFs within the QMOF database. We have applied a tight-binding, lattice Hamiltonian and density functional theory to MOFs for performing electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we provide a tight-binding representation of 10,000 MOFs, and an Extended Hubbard model representation for a sub-set of 240 MOFs containing transition metals, where intra-site U and inter-site V parameters are computed self-consistently. The data supports computational workflows for identifying structure-property correlations that are needed for inverse material design. For validation and reuse, we have made the data available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/tbhubbard/.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a realistic model relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$ and other altermagnetic perovskite oxides, we study interrelations between weak ferromagnetism (WF), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and net orbital magnetization (OM). All of them can be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Nevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the same sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign components, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic model remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t} \}$, combining the shift ${\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices to each other with the spin flip $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure remains spin-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing a possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic splitting of bands, breaking the $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t}\}$ symmetry, does not play a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain, responsible for finite values of AHE and OM.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are severely limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, which reveals a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating. Evaporation rates dramatically increase with short-wavelength illumination. Violet-light illumination achieves 4-10x higher evaporation enhancement compared to orange and IR light. Our results identify a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation and opportunities to employ ceramic wicks for salt harvesting. Such low-cost, low-energy desalination systems would reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials leveraging microstructure representation from foundational vision transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific approaches in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability. Code is available at github.com/ASK-Berkeley/OM-TPS.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</description>
