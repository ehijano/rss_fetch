      <title>Coupled opinion-environmental dynamics in polarized and prejudiced populations</title>

Abstract: Public opinion on environmental issues remains polarized in many countries, posing a significant barrier to the implementation of effective policies. Behind this polarization, empirical studies have identified social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience as dominant factors in opinion formation on environmental issues. However, current coupled human-environment models have not yet incorporated all three factors in polarized populations. We developed a stylized coupled human-environment model to investigate how social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience shape opinion formation and the environment in polarized populations. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the conditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic dynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and the factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is the key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly prejudiced populations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of objectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced by decreasing the role of prejudice or increasing the willingness to consider opposing opinions. Finally, our model shows that cost reduction methods are less effective at reducing environmental impact in prejudiced populations. Our model generates thresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the factors which influence the population's opinion formation. Overall, our model provides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social structures in determining human-environment dynamics.</description>

      <title>Behavioral alignment in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orderly behaviors observed in large-scale groups, such as fish schooling and the organized movement of crowds, are both ubiquitous and essential for the survival and stability of these systems. Understanding how such complex collective behaviors emerge from simple local interactions and behavioral adjustments is a significant scientific challenge. Historically, research has predominantly focused on imitation and social learning, where individuals adopt the strategies of more successful peers to refine their behavior. However, in recent years, an alternative learning approach based on self-exploration and introspective learning has garnered increasing attention. In this paradigm, individuals assess their own circumstances and select strategies that best align with their specific conditions. Two examples are coordination and anti-coordination, where individuals align with and diverge from the local majority, respectively. In this study, we analyze networked systems of coordinating and anti-coordinating individuals, exploring the combined effects of system dynamics, network structure, and behavioral patterns. We address several practical questions, including the number of equilibria, their characteristics, the equilibrium time, and the resilience of the system. We find that the number of equilibrium states can be extremely large, even increasing exponentially with minor alterations to the network structure. Moreover, the network structure has a significant impact on the average equilibrium time. Despite the complexity of these findings, we find that variations can be captured by a single, simple network characteristic (the average path length), which we illustrate in both synthetic and empirical networks.</description>
