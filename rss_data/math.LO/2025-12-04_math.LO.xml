      <title>A joint logic of problems and propositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a 1985 commentary to his collected works, Kolmogorov informed the reader that his 1932 paper 'On the interpretation of intuitionistic logic' "was written in hope that with time, the logic of solution of problems [i.e., intuitionistic logic] will become a permanent part of a [standard] course of logic. A unified logical apparatus was intended to be created, which would deal with objects of two types - propositions and problems." We construct such a formal system as well as its predicate version, QHC, which is a conservative extension of both the intuitionistic predicate calculus QH and the classical predicate calculus QC. The axioms of QHC are obtained as a result of a simultaneous formalization of two well-known alternative explanations of intiuitionistic logic: 1) Kolmogorov's problem interpretation (with familiar refinements by Heyting and Kreisel) and 2) the proof interpretation by Orlov and Heyting, as clarified and extended by G\"odel.</description>

      <title>Perfect set dichotomy theorem in generalized Solovay model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the perfect set dichotomy theorem holds in the Solovay model $V ((\omega^\omega)^{V[G]})$. Namely, for every equivalence relation $E$ on $\mathbb{R}$, either $\mathbb{R}/E$ is well-orderable or there exists a perfect set consisting of $E$-inequivalent reals.
  Furthermore we consider a generalization of the Solovay model for an uncountable regular cardinal $\mu$ and show the perfect set dichotomy theorem for $\mu^\mu$ also holds in that model.
  We establish the three element basis theorem for uncountable linear orders in the Solovay model for a weakly compact cardinal, in a general form covering the uncountable case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semigroup of invariant types through the lens of Ellis theory; primarily focusing on definably amenable NIP groups. In this context, we observe that the collection of strong right $f$-generic types forms the unique minimal left ideal and thus, the Ellis subgroups are isomorphic to $G/G^{00}$ via the canonical quotient map. As consequence of the Newelski-Pillay conjecture, the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of invariant types are abstractly isomorphic to the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of finitely satisfiable types in the definable amenable NIP setting. We are interested in the existence of natural isomorphisms from invariant Ellis subgroups to finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups and we determine when these isomorphisms can be witnessed by variants of the canonical NIP retraction map. Several limiting examples are provided. Outside of the NIP context, we provide an abelian group (and thus definably amenable) with an $\emptyset$-definable (dfg) type in which the invariant Ellis subgroups and finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Bi-Isolated d.c.e. Degrees and $\Sigma_1$ Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03778v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Turing degree is d.c.e. if it contains a set that is the difference of two c.e. sets. A d.c.e. degree $\mathbf{d}$ is isolated if there exists a c.e. degree $\mathbf{a}&lt;\mathbf{d}$ such that every c.e. degree below $\mathbf{d}$ is also below $\mathbf{a}$; $\mathbf{d}$ is upper isolated if there exists a c.e. degree $\mathbf{a}&gt;\mathbf{d}$ such that every c.e. degree above $\mathbf{d}$ is also above $\mathbf{a}$; $\mathbf{d}$ is bi-isolated if it is both isolated and upper isolated. In this paper, we prove the existence of bi-isolated d.c.e. degrees in models of $\mathsf{I}\Sigma_1$.</description>

      <title>A Cut-Free Sequent Calculus for the Analysis of Finite-Trace Properties in Concurrent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a proof-theoretic framework that enables a compositional analysis of finite-trace properties in concurrent systems, with a particular focus on those specified via prefix-closure. To this end, we investigate the interaction of a prefix-closure operator and its residual (with respect to set-theoretic inclusion) with language intersection, union, and concatenation, and introduce the variety of closure $\ell$-monoids as a minimal algebraic abstraction of finite-trace properties to be conveniently described within an analytic proof system. Closure $\ell$-monoids are division-free reducts of distributive residuated lattices equipped with a forward diamond/backward box residuated pair of unary modal operators, where the diamond is a topological closure operator satisfying $\Diamond(x \cdot y) \leq \Diamond x \cdot \Diamond y$. As a logical counterpart to these structures, we present $\mathsf{LMC}$, a Gentzen-style system based on the division-free fragment of the Distributive Full Lambek Calculus. In $\mathsf{LMC}$, structural terms are built from formulas using Belnap-style structural operators for monoid multiplication, meet, and diamond. The rules for the modalities and the structural diamond are taken from Moortgat's system $\mathsf{NL}(\Diamond)$. We show that the calculus is sound and complete with respect to the variety of closure $\ell$-monoids and that it admits cut elimination.</description>

      <title>Generalized Von Neumann Universe and Non-Well-Founded Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a generalized version of the von Neumann universe known as the total universe is proposed to formally introduce non-well-founded sets that include infinitons, semi-infinitons and quasi-infinitons in Russell's paradox. All three infinitons are part of infinitely generated sets that are generators of non-well-founded sets. Combining the well-founded sets with the non-well-founded sets, the total universe is a model of ZF minus the axiom of regularity and free of Russell's paradox. The axiom of regularity is invalid in defining well-founded sets and wrong in any system consistent with ZF set theory.</description>

      <title>On the structure and theory of McCarthy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a structural analysis for McCarthy algebras, the variety generated by the three-element algebra defining the logic of McCarthy (the non-commutative version of Kleene three-valued logics). Our analysis will be conducted in a very general algebraic setting by introducing McCarthy algebras as a subvariety of unital bands (idempotent monoids) equipped with an involutive (unary) operation $'$ satisfying $x''\approx x$; herein referred to as i-ubands. Prominent (commutative) subvarieties of i-ubands include Boolean algebras, ortholattices, Kleene algebras, and involutive bisemilattices, hence i-ubands provides an algebraic common ground for several non-classical logics. Our main contributions consist in providing for McCarthy algebras: reduced and equivalent axiomatizations; a semilattice decomposition theorem; and representations as certain decorated posets from which the algebraic structure can be uniquely determined.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Effective Reductions with Ordinal Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1811.11630, we introduced a notion of effective reducibility between set-theoretical $\Pi_{2}$-statements; in arXiv:2411.19386, this was extended to statements of arbitrary (potentially even infinite) quantifier complexity. We also considered a corresponding notion of Weihrauch reducibility, which allows only one call to the effectivizer of $\psi$ in a reduction of $\phi$ to $\psi$. In this paper, we refine this notion considerably by asking how many calls to an effectivizer for $\psi$ are required for effectivizing $\phi$. This allows us make formally precise questions such as ``how many ordinals does one need to check for being cardinals in order to compute the cardinality of a given ordinal?'' and (partially) answer many of them. Many of these anwers turn out to be independent of ZFC.</description>

      <title>A Fibonacci-Based G\"odel Numbering: $\Delta_0$ Semantics Without Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a fully additive account of Incompleteness based on finite supports of Fibonacci indices and Zeckendorf representations. "Carryless Pairing" provides an injective, reversible encoding of tuples, with evaluation and inversion confined to finite index domains. Using this framework, we obtain $\Delta_0$-definable encodings of terms, formulas, proofs, and a substitution operator, and we formalize the provability predicate entirely within bounded arithmetic. The Diagonal Lemma and G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem are then recovered without multiplication or unbounded search. The resulting system isolates a structure sufficient for self-reference and is grounded in finite-support recursion.</description>

      <title>Directed schemes of ideals and cardinal characteristics, I: the meager additive ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of directed scheme of ideals to characterize peculiar ideals on the reals, which comes from a formalization of the framework of Yorioka ideals for strong measure zero sets. We prove general theorems for directed schemes and propose a directed scheme $\vec{\mathcal{M}} = \{\mathcal{M}_I \colon I\in\mathbb{I}\}$ for the ideal $\mathcal{MA}$ of meager-additive sets of reals. This directed scheme does not only helps us to understand more the combinatorics of $\mathcal{MA}$ and its cardinal characteristics, but provides us new characterizations of the additivity and cofinality numbers of the meager ideal of the reals.
  In addition, we display connections between the characteristics associated with $\mathcal{M}_I$ and other classical characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency of $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{NA})&lt;\mathfrak{c}$ and $\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{MA})&lt;\mathrm{non}(\mathcal{SN})$. The first one answers a question raised by the authors in arXiv:2401.15364.</description>

      <title>Nested Sequents for Intuitionistic Grammar Logics via Structural Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intuitionistic grammar logics fuse constructive and multi-modal reasoning while permitting the use of converse modalities, serving as a generalization of standard intuitionistic modal logics. In this paper, we provide definitions of these logics as well as establish a suitable proof theory thereof. In particular, we show how to apply the structural refinement methodology to extract cut-free nested sequent calculi for intuitionistic grammar logics from their semantics. This method proceeds by first transforming the semantics of these logics into sound and complete labeled sequent systems, which we prove have favorable proof-theoretic properties such as syntactic cut-elimination. We then transform these labeled systems into nested sequent systems via the introduction of propagation rules and the elimination of structural rules. Our derived proof systems are then put to use, whereby we prove the conservativity of intuitionistic grammar logics over their modal counterparts, establish the general undecidability of these logics, and recognize a decidable subclass, referred to as "simple" intuitionistic grammar logics.</description>
