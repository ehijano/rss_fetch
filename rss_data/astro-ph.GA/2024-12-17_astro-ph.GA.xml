      <title>Dense gas scaling relations at kiloparsec scale across nearby galaxies with the ALMA ALMOND and IRAM 30-m EMPIRE surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense, cold gas is the key ingredient for star formation. Over the last two decades, HCN(1-0) emission has been utilised as the most accessible dense gas tracer to study external galaxies. We present new measurements tracing the relationship between dense gas tracers, bulk molecular gas tracers, and star formation in the ALMA ALMOND survey, the largest sample of resolved (1-2 kpc resolution) HCN maps of galaxies in the local universe (d &lt; 25 Mpc). We measure HCN/CO, a line ratio sensitive to the physical density distribution, and SFR/HCN, a proxy for the dense gas star formation efficiency, as a function of molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density, and dynamical equilibrium pressure across 31 galaxies, increasing the number of galaxies by a factor of &gt; 3 over the previous largest such study (EMPIRE). HCN/CO increases (slope of ~ 0.5 and scatter of ~ 0.2 dex), while SFR/HCN decreases (slope of ~ -0.6 and scatter of ~ 0.4 dex) with increasing molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density and pressure. Galaxy centres with high stellar mass surface density show a factor of a few higher HCN/CO and lower SFR/HCN compared to the disc average, but both environments follow the same average trend. Our results emphasise that molecular gas properties vary systematically with the galactic environment and demonstrate that the scatter in the Gao-Solomon relation (SFR against HCN) is of physical origin.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: direct estimates of C, N, and O abundances in two relatively metal-rich galaxies at $\mathbf{z\simeq5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of two star-forming galaxies at z~5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey. The detection of the C III]$\lambda\lambda$1906,09, [O II]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4363,5007, and [N II]$\lambda$6584 nebular emission lines enables investigation of the C/O, N/O, and C/N abundance ratios using the temperature-sensitive method. The two galaxies have stellar masses of log($M_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$ ) = 8.13$\pm$0.09 and log($M_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$ )=8.52$\pm$0.13 and corresponding metallicities of Z~0.2Z$_{\odot}$ and Z~0.3Z$_{\odot}$. These metallicities are somewhat higher than is typical for other z&gt;5 galaxies with similar stellar mass and are in fact comparable to high-redshift analogue galaxies at z~0. Both galaxies display evidence for N/O enhancement with respect to the z~0 sample, with log(N/O)=-1.07$\pm$0.17 and log(N/O)=-0.86$\pm$0.15 respectively. In contrast, we find low C abundances, with log(C/O)=-0.82$\pm$0.22 and log(C/O)=-1.02$\pm$0.22, consistent with the predicted yields of core-collapse supernovae. Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the C/N ratios are lower at fixed O/H compared to the majority of local galaxies. In contrast to the top-heavy IMF invoked in some studies to explain low C/N ratios in metal-poor galaxies, we find, via comparison to chemical evolution models, that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF better explains the observed abundance ratios in more enriched systems due to an increase in N-enrichment from intermediate mass (4-7M$_{\odot}$) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with JWST can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.</description>

      <title>The Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are part of a vast cosmic ecosystem, embedded in an extensive gaseous reservoir that regulates their growth by providing the necessary fuel for star formation while preserving a fossil record of past interactions, outflows, and feedback processes. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains multiphase gas spanning a broad dynamic range in spatial scale, density, and temperature, with its thermodynamic and chemical properties deeply linked to the star formation histories of galaxies. As a rich laboratory for studying gas physics, the CGM offers unique insights into the processes governing gas cooling, heating, and material transfer between galaxies and their surroundings. Chemical tagging, based on the relative abundances of multiple elements, serves as a powerful timing tool to trace the origin of the gas and connect the stars in the interstellar medium (ISM) to the diffuse CGM. Developing a complete understanding of the CGM and its cosmic evolution requires multi-wavelength observational tools, ranging from X-ray, UV/optical, and sub-mm to radio, to probe this diffuse gas in both absorption and emission.</description>

      <title>The central engine of low-luminosity radio galaxy 3C 270</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the polarization spectra of the nucleus of 3C 270. We confirm that the polarization angle of both the continuum and the emission lines are close to perpendicular to the jet direction after careful correction of interstellar polarization, which indicates polar scattering. The Stokes flux spectrum resembles the total flux spectrum, with no need for a broad component from the Broad Line Region. Over 94% of the Seyfert I type broad line profile would be significantly detected if present in our polarized flux spectrum. We favor that we are mostly likely observing beamed synchrotron instead of Big Blue Bump, and the innermost Narrow Line Region through reflection. This makes 3C 270 the third known case, after NGC 4258 and Centaurus A, where only narrow lines (and beamed continuum, if present) are scattered, with no evidence of an underlying Big Blue Bump.</description>

      <title>Ultra Diffuse Dwarf Galaxies Hosting Pseudo-bulges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing data from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey, we have identified five ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) featuring central pseudo-bulges. These UDGs display blue pseudo-bulges with S\'ersic indices $n&lt;2.5$ and effective radii spanning 300-700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using HI line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers, while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent ``failed $L^{\star}$ galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution HI observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early universe, and may be the descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early universe.</description>

      <title>OB associations: from stellar to galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-density and unbound stellar groups, OB associations have been historically delineated through their bright and massive members. They have been analysed for decades, but the arrival of Hipparcos, and more recently of Gaia led to a change of paradigm by allowing the identification of more reliable members using parallaxes and proper motions. This renewed interest offers an opportunity to emphasize the role of OB associations across many areas of astronomy. In this review, I highlight their importance across multiple scales: how OB associations constitute suitable sites to study massive stars and stellar multiplicity, their relation with star clusters, their interactions with the interstellar medium through the feedback of their massive members, and how they shape the structure and evolution of the Milky Way and beyond.</description>

      <title>Radial-dependent Responsivity of Broad-line Regions in Active Galactic Nuclei: Observational Consequences for Reverberation Mapping and Black Hole Mass Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reverberation mapping (RM) technique has seen wide applications in probing geometry and kinematics of broad-line regions (BLRs) and measuring masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei. However, the key quantities in RM analysis like emissivity, responsivity, transfer functions, and mean and root-mean-square (RMS) spectra are fragmentally defined in the literature and largely lack a unified formulation. Here, we establish a rigorous framework for BLR RM and include a locally dependent responsivity according to photoionization calculations. The mean and RMS spectra are analytically expressed with emissivity- and responsivity-weighted transfer functions, respectively. We demonstrate that the RMS spectrum is proportional to the responsivity-weighted transfer function only when the continuum variation timescale is much longer than the typical extension in time delay of the BLR, otherwise, biases arise in the obtained RMS line widths. The long-standing phenomenon as to the different shapes between mean and RMS spectra can be explained by a radial-increasing responsivity of BLRs. The debate on the choice of emission line widths for SMBH mass measurements is explored and the virial factors are suggested to also depend on the luminosity states, in addition to the geometry and kinematics of BLRs.</description>

      <title>The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. II. Evidence for Magnetically Dominated HII Regions in the CMZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST-NIRCam narrow-band, 4.05 $\mu$m Brackett-$\alpha$ images of the Sgr C HII region, located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. Unlike any HII region in the Solar vicinity, the Sgr C plasma is dominated by filamentary structure in both Brackett-$\alpha$ and the radio continuum. Some bright filaments, which form a fractured arc with a radius of about 1.85 pc centered on the Sgr C star-forming molecular clump, likely trace ionization fronts. The brightest filaments form a `$\pi$-shaped' structure in the center of the HII region. Fainter filaments radiate away from the surface of the Sgr C molecular cloud. The filaments are emitting optically thin free-free emission, as revealed by spectral index measurements from 1.28 GHz (MeerKAT) to 97 GHz (ALMA). But, the negative in-band 1 to 2 GHz spectral index in the MeerKAT data alone reveals the presence of a non-thermal component across the entire Sgr C HII region. We argue that the plasma flow in Sgr C is controlled by magnetic fields, which confine the plasma to rope-like filaments or sheets. This results in the measured non-thermal component of low-frequency radio emission plasma, as well as a plasma $\beta$ (thermal pressure divided by magnetic pressure) below 1, even in the densest regions. We speculate that all mature HII regions in the CMZ, and galactic nuclei in general, evolve in a magnetically dominated, low plasma $\beta$ regime.</description>

      <title>Minor-merger induced star formation rejuvenation in an elliptical radio-loud quasar host, 3C 59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a rare case where an elliptical radio-loud quasar host, 3C 59, rejuvenates star formation activity through minor mergers with its nearby satellite galaxies. The inferred star formation history of 3C 59 shows significant star formation rejuvenation within the past 500 Myr, before which remains rather quiescent for most of the cosmic time. Three nearest satellite galaxies of 3C 59 exhibit significant morphological disturbances, and two of them present strong tidal tails pointing towards 3C 59. In addition, all the satellite galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc show low star formation activities. They also have systematically lower effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$) than local late-type galaxies, while 3C 59 has significantly larger $R_{\rm e}$ than both early- and late-type galaxies. All these features suggest that ongoing minor mergers between 3C 59 and its nearby satellites could be causing gas to flow into 3C 59, which induces the star formation rejuvenation, and possibly also triggers the quasar activity. The enormous power from the large-scale radio jet of 3C 59 may in turn help keep the halo hot, prevent gas cooling, and further reduce star formation in its satellite galaxies. These results provide important insights into the mass and size growth of central galaxies and star formation quenching of satellite galaxies in galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Looking At the Distant Universe with the MeerKAT Array: the HI Mass Function in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) and cosmic HI density ($\Omega_{\rm HI}$) at $0 \leq z \leq 0.088$ from the Looking at the Distant Universe with MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey. Using LADUMA Data Release 1 (DR1), we analyze the HIMF via a new "recovery matrix" (RM) method that we benchmark against a more traditional Modified Maximum Likelihood (MML) method. Our analysis, which implements a forward modeling approach, corrects for survey incompleteness and uses extensive synthetic source injections to ensure robust estimates of the HIMF parameters and their associated uncertainties. This new method tracks the recovery of sources in mass bins different from those in which they were injected and incorporates a Poisson likelihood in the forward modeling process, allowing it to correctly handle uncertainties in bins with few or no detections. The application of our analysis to a high-purity subsample of the LADUMA DR1 spectral line catalog in turn mitigates any possible biases that could result from the inconsistent treatment of synthetic and real sources. For the surveyed redshift range, the recovered Schechter function normalization, low-mass slope, and "knee" mass are $\phi_\ast = 3.56_{-1.92}^{+0.97} \times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ dex$^{-1}$, $\alpha = -1.18_{-0.19}^{+0.08}$, and $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) = 10.01_{-0.12}^{+0.31}$, respectively, which together imply a comoving cosmic HI density of $\Omega_{\rm HI}=3.09_{-0.47}^{+0.65}\times 10^{-4}$. Our results show consistency between RM and MML methods and with previous low-redshift studies, giving confidence that the cosmic volume probed by LADUMA, even at low redshifts, is not an outlier in terms of its HI content.</description>

      <title>Classification of Spiral Galaxies by Spiral Arm Number using Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural information of spiral galaxies such as the spiral arm number, offer valuable insights into their formation processes and physical roles in galaxy evolution. We developed classifiers based on CNNs using variants of the EfficientNet architecture with different transfer learning techniques and pre-trained weights to categorise spiral galaxies by their number of spiral arms. A dataset from GZ2, comprising 11718 images filtered based on appropriate criteria is used for training and evaluation. Both the EfficientNetV2M model fine-tuned on ImageNet and the EfficientNetB0 model with Zoobot pre-trained weights achieved high accuracy on the down-sampled dataset, with most performance metrics exceeding 0.8 across all classes, except for galaxies with 4 arms due to the limited number of samples in this category. Merging higher-arm-number classes (more than 4 arms) improved the V2M model's accuracy significantly for 4-arm galaxies, as this approach allowed the model to focus on more distinct features with a more balanced class distribution. GradCAM++ and SmoothGrad highlight the networks' effectiveness in classifying galaxies, through the distinction of the galaxy structures and the extraction of the spiral arms, with the V2M model showing better capabilities in both tasks. Lower-arm galaxies tend to be misclassified as "can't tell" when their spiral arms are not clearly visible, while higher-arm galaxies tend to be misclassified as having fewer arms when their features are only partially detected. The study also found that galaxies with 3 arms tend to have lower stellar masses, and this tendency is reduced in the model predictions. The models' mispredictions between 2-arm and 1/3-arm are likely resulting from external interference and dynamic nature of spiral arms. The V2M model prediction also shows a slight tendency towards higher stellar mass in high-arm galaxies.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. V. Clustered Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\sim8-40\,\mu$m SOFIA-FORCAST images of seven regions of ``clustered" star formation as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. We identify a total of 34 protostar candidates and build their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We fit these SEDs with a grid of radiative transfer models based on the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory to derive key protostellar properties, including initial core mass, $M_c$, clump environment mass surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and current protostellar mass, $m_*$. We also carry out empirical graybody (GB) estimation of $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, which allows a case of restricted SED fitting within the TCA model grid. We also release version 2.0 of the open-source Python package \emph{sedcreator}, designed to automate the aperture photometry and SED building and fitting process for sources in clustered environments, where flux contamination from close neighbors typically complicates the process. Using these updated methods, SED fitting yields values of $M_c\sim30-200\:M_{\odot}$, $\Sigma_{\text{cl,SED}}\sim0.1-3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$, and $m_*\sim4-50\:M_{\odot}$. The graybody fitting yields smaller values of $\Sigma_{\text{cl,GB}}\lesssim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$. From these results, we do not find evidence for a critical $\Sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ needed to form massive ($\gtrsim 8\:M_\odot$) stars. However, we do find tentative evidence for a dearth of the most massive ($m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$) protostars in the clustered regions suggesting a potential impact of environment on the stellar initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Modelling chemical clocks -- Theoretical evidences of the space and time evolution of [s/alpha] in the Galactic disc with Gaia-ESO survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical clocks based on [s-process elements/alpha-elements] ratios are widely used to estimate ages of Galactic stellar populations. However, the [s/alpha] vs. age relations are not universal, varying with metallicity, location in the Galactic disc, and specific s-process elements. Current Galactic chemical evolution models struggle to reproduce the observed [s/alpha] increase at young ages. We provide chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disc to identify the conditions required to reproduce the observed [s/H], [s/Fe], and [s/alpha] vs. age relations. We adopt a multi-zone chemical evolution model including state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis prescriptions for neutron-capture elements (AGB stars, rotating massive stars, neutron star mergers, magneto-driven supernovae). We explore variations in gas infall, AGB yield dependencies on progenitor stars, and rotational velocity distributions for massive stars. Results are compared with open cluster data from the Gaia-ESO survey. A three-infall scenario for disc formation captures the rise of [s/alpha] with age in the outer regions but fails in the inner ones, especially for second s-process peak elements. Ba production in the last 3 Gyr of chemical evolution would need to increase by half to match observations. S-process contributions from low-mass AGB stars improve predictions but require increases not supported by nucleosynthesis calculations, even with potential i-process contribution. Variations in the metallicity dependence of AGB yields show inconsistent effects across elements. Distributions of massive star rotational velocities fail to improve results due to balanced effects on elements. We confirm that there is no single relationship [s/alpha] vs. age, but that it varies along the MW disc. Current prescriptions for neutron-capture element yields cannot fully capture the complexity of evolution, particularly in the inner disc.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Stillness: High Quiescent Galaxy Fractions Across Upper Mass Scales in the Early Universe to z = 7 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation into the abundance and morphology of high redshift quenched galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 7$ using James Webb Space Telescope data in the NEP, CEERS and JADES fields. Within these fields, we identify 90 candidate passive galaxies using specific star formation rates modelled with the BAGPIPES SED fitting code, which is more effective at identifying recently quenched systems than the classical UVJ method. With this sample of galaxies, we find number densities broadly consistent with other works and a rapidly evolving passive fraction of high mass galaxies ($\log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &gt; $ 9.5) between $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$. We find that the fraction of galaxies with low star formation rates and mass 9.5 $ &lt; \log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &lt; $ 10.5 decreases from $\sim$25% at $3 &lt; z &lt; 4$ to $\sim$2% at $5 &lt; z &lt; 7$. Our passive sample of galaxies is shown to exhibit more compact light profiles compared to star-forming counterparts and some exhibit traces of AGN activity through detections in either the X-ray or radio. At the highest redshifts ($z &gt; 6.5$) passive selections start to include examples of 'little red dots' which complicates any conclusions until their nature is better understood.</description>

      <title>To model or not to model: nebular continuum in galaxy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neglect of modelling both stellar and nebular emission significantly affects the derived physical properties of galaxies, particularly those with high star formation rates. While this issue has been studied, it has not been established a clear threshold for a significant impact on the estimated physical properties of galaxies due to accounting for both stellar and nebular emission. We analyse galaxies from SDSS-DR7 across a wide range of star-forming activity levels, comparing the results obtained from two spectral fitting tools: FADO (which considers both stellar and nebular continuum) and STARLIGHT (only considers the stellar continuum). A strong linear correlation is found between the rest-frame H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ equivalent widths (EWs) and the optical nebular contribution, identifying these as reliable tracers. The results show that when the nebular contribution exceeds 8% (corresponding to EW(H$\alpha$)$\simeq$500 \r{A} and EW(H$\beta$)$\simeq$110 \r{A}), there is a significant impact on the estimation of galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, age and metallicity. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account both the stellar and nebular continuum when analysing the optical spectra of star-forming galaxies. In particular, this is a fundamental aspect for galaxies with a rest-frame EW(H$\alpha$)$\gtrsim$500 \r{A} (or the scaled value of 375 \r{A} for pseudo-continuum measures). At low redshifts, this mostly impacts extreme emission line galaxies, while at higher redshifts it becomes a dominant aspect given the higher star-forming activity in the younger Universe. In light of current JWST observations and future instruments designed for high-redshift observations, such as MOONS, this reveals as a critical issue to take into consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Milgromian acceleration of MOND and the cosmological constant can be understood and quantified as the effects of quantum fluctuations of spin connection which are described by precanonical quantum gravity put forward by one of us earlier. We also show that a MOND-like modification of Newtonian dynamics at small accelerations emerges from this picture in the non-relativistic approximation.</description>

      <title>MOCKA -- A PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue: Simulations for gravity-mode oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With ESA's PLATO space mission set for launch in December 2026, a new photometric legacy and a future of new scientific discoveries await. In this work we investigate PLATO's potential for observing pulsating stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as part of the PLATO Complimentary Science program (PLATO-CS). Specifically, a PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue (MOCKA) of intermediate to massive stars is presented as a benchmark to highlight the asteroseismic yield of PLATO-CS in a quantitative way. MOCKA includes simulations of $\beta$~Cephei, slowly pulsating B (SPB), $\delta$~Scuti, $\gamma$~Doradus, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, hot subdwarf, and white dwarf stars. In particular, main-sequence gravity (g) mode pulsators are of interest as some of these stars form an important foundation for the scientific calibration of PLATO. MOCKA is based on a magnitude limited ($G\lesssim17$) \textit{Gaia} catalogue and is a product of realistic end-to-end \texttt{PlatoSim} simulations of stars for the first PLATO pointing field in the Southern hemisphere, which will be observed for a minimally 2-yr duration. We show that an abundant spectrum of frequencies is achievable across a wide range of magnitudes and co-pointing PLATO cameras. Within the magnitude limited regimes simulated ($G \lesssim 14$ for $\gamma$~Doradus stars and $G \lesssim 16$ for SPB stars) the dominant g-mode frequency is recovered in more than $95\%$ of the cases. MOCKA help us to understand the limits of the PLATO mission as well as highlight the opportunities to push astrophysics beyond current stellar models. All data products of this paper are made available to the community for further exploration. The key data products of MOCKA are the magnitude limited \textit{Gaia} catalogue of the first PLATO pointing field, together with fully reduced light curves from multi-camera observations for each pulsation class.</description>

      <title>B2 1308+326: a changing-look blazar or not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous study, we identified a shift in the synchrotron peak frequency of the blazar B2 1308$+$326 from 10$^{12.9}$ Hz to 10$^{14.8}$ Hz during a flare, suggesting it could be a changing-look blazar (CLB). In this work, we investigate the CL behaviour of B2 1308+326 by analysing a newly acquired optical spectrum and comparing it with an archival spectrum. We find that between the two epochs, the continuum flux increased by a factor of $\sim$4.4, while the Mg II emission line flux decreased by a factor of 1.4$\pm$0.2. Additionally, the equivalent width of the Mg II line reduced from $\sim 20$ \AA \ to $\sim 3$ \AA, indicating an apparent shift from a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) class to a BL Lacertae (BL Lac) class. Despite this apparent change, the ratio of accretion disk luminosity to Eddington luminosity remains $&gt;$ 10$^{-2}$ during both epochs, indicating efficient accretion persists in B2 1308$+$326. The measured black hole mass remains consistent with an average $\log M_{\rm BH} = 8.44$ M$_{\odot}$. Our findings suggest that B2 1308$+$326 is not a genuine CLB, but rather an intrinsic FSRQ that emerges as a BL Lac during high-flux states due to enhanced non-thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Dust Scattering Albedo at Millimeter-Wavelengths in the TW Hya Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary bodies are formed by coagulation of solid dust grains in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, it is crucial to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the dust grains. In this study, we measure the dust albedo at mm-wavelength, which depends on dust properties at the disk midplane. Since the albedo and dust temperature are generally degenerate in observed thermal dust emission, it is challenging to determine them simultaneously. We propose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically-thin molecular lines as a dust-albedo independent thermometer. In practice, we employ pressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line. We model the CO $J=2-1$ and $3-2$ spectra observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) at the inner region ($r&lt;6\ {\rm au}$) of the TW Hya disk and successfully derived the midplane temperature. Combining multi-band continuum observations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at $0.9-3$ mm for the first time without assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high, $\sim0.5-0.8$, and broadly consistent with the Ricci et al. (2010), DIANA, and DSHARP dust models. Even without assuming dust composition, we estimate the maximum grain size to be $\sim 340\ \mu m$, the power law index of the grain size distribution to be $&gt;-4.1$, and porosity to be $&lt;0.96$. The derived dust size may suggest efficient fragmentation with the threshold velocity of $\sim 0.08\ {\rm m\ s^{-1}}$. We also note that the absolute flux uncertainty of $\sim10\%$ ($1\sigma$) is measured and used in the analysis, which is approximately twice the usually assumed value.</description>

      <title>A UV to X-ray view of soft excess in type 1 AGNs: I. sample selection and spectral profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs with simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations is compiled from archive to probe the nature of soft X-ray excess (SE). In the first paper of this series, our focus centers on scrutinizing the spectral profile of the soft excess. Of the sources, $\approx$ 71% (42/59) exhibit powerlaw-like (po-like) soft excess, while $\approx$ 29% (17/59) exhibit blackbody-like (bb-like) soft excess. We show a cut-off powerlaw could uniformly characterize both types of soft excesses, with median Ecut of 1.40 keV for po-like and 0.14 keV for bb-like. For the first time, we report a robust and quantitative correlation between the SE profile and SE strength (the ratio of SE luminosity to that of the primary powerlaw continuum in 0.5 - 2.0 keV), indicating that stronger soft excess is more likely to be po-like, or effectively has a higher Ecut. This correlation cannot be explained by ionized disk reflection alone, which produces mostly bb-like soft excess (Ecut $\sim$ 0.1 keV) as revealed by relxilllp simulation. Remarkably, we show with simulations that a toy hybrid scenario, where both ionized disk reflection (relxilllp, with all reflection parameters fixed at default values except for ionization of the disk) and warm corona (compTT, with temperature fixed at 1 keV) contribute to the observed soft excess, can successfully reproduce the observed correlation. This highlights the ubiquitous hybrid nature of the soft X-ray excess in AGNs, and underscores the importance of considering both components while fitting the spectra of soft excess.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to present the results of a Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). In this work we present the results of the search and further detailed investigation of the objects, found in the course of the BNBIS survey in the southern part of the Mon R2 association. For the search of HH objects the narrow band images, obtained with the 1-m Schmidt telescope of the Byurakan Observatory, were used. Newly found objects were imaged in optical and near-IR range with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 meter telescope, and observed spectrally with long-slit spectrograph and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer on 6 m telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences using SCORPIO-2. We found three new HH groups: HH 1233, HH 1234 and HH 1235, two of them represent extended collimated flows. HH 1233 is the C-shape bipolar outflow system associated with the 2MASS 06084223$-$0657385 source star. HH 1234 is the helical chain of HH knots near the star V963 Mon. HH 1235 is a separate compact knot, connected with the visible only in mid- and far-IR source WISE J060856.57$-$070103.5. We found also several molecular hydrogen outflows, one of which coincides with HH 1233 and two other are associated with the deeply embedded IR sources in the same field. One more probable bipolar H$_2$ outflow is related to WISE J060856.57$-$070103.5. The emission spectra and spectral energy distributions of the source stars were analyzed. According to them they should be under rather early evolutional stage.</description>

      <title>Timing of Seven Isolated Pulsars in the Globular Cluster Terzan 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters host large populations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) due to their high gravitational encounter rates, producing many binary systems and thus MSPs via the recycling process. Seven pulsars with spin periods ranging from 3 ms to 134 ms have been discovered in Terzan 1, which was targeted for pulsar searches with the Green Bank Telescope after Australia Telescope Compact Array imaging revealed steep-spectrum point sources in the cluster core. We have obtained timing observations over seven years, for the first seven Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discoveries (Terzan 1 A through G), using the GBT and Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. All seven pulsars are isolated, consistent with Terzan 1's classification as a core-collapsed cluster (core collapse is predicted to disrupt, or ionize, binaries). With these timing solutions, we measured the positions and observed period derivatives, dP/dt, for each pulsar. The measured dP/dt values are composed of intrinsic spin-down and accelerations experienced by the pulsars (primarily from the cluster's gravitational potential), and they can be used to infer line-of-sight accelerations. We attempted to constrain the radius and density of the cluster core using these inferred accelerations. A wide range of radii and densities are possible, pointing to the need for continued timing as well as new discoveries to better constrain these cluster properties. We additionally find that Ter 1 A may be younger than the cluster and thus may have formed via a formation channel other than a core-collapse supernova. Theoretical formation mechanisms such as electron-capture supernovae from accretion- or merger-induced collapse of white dwarfs could potentially explain these pulsars' origins. It may therefore be a member of a small but growing class of globular cluster pulsars that appear to be significantly younger than their host clusters.</description>

      <title>X-ray properties of coronal emission in radio quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powerful sources of panchromatic radiation. All AGN emit in X-rays, contributing around $\sim 5-10\%$ of the AGN bolometric luminosity. The X-ray emitting region, popularly known as the corona, is geometrically and radiatively compact with a size typically $\lesssim 10 \, R_{\rm G}$ (gravitational radii). The rapid and extreme variability in X-rays also suggest that the corona must be a dynamic structure. Decades of X-ray studies have shed much light on the topic, but the nature and origin of AGN corona are still not clearly understood. This is mostly due to the complexities involved in several physical processes at play in the high-gravity, high-density and high-temperature region in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is still not clear how exactly the corona is energetically and physically sustained near a SMBH. Since corona is ubiquitously found in AGN, is there something fundamental about the accretion process that produces it? In this review we discuss the X-ray observational properties of the corona in radio quiet AGN.</description>

Abstract: The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</description>

      <title>Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and {\it Gaia} DR3 parallaxes. II. Red giants and red clump stars from the {\it Kepler} catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11606</link>

Abstract: A recent investigation highlighted peculiar trends between the radii derived from surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) combined with Gaia DR3 parallaxes with respect to asteroseismic scaling relation radii from K2 data. [...] We investigated on the robustness of the results based on Kepler data. We cross-matched asteroseismic and astrometric data for over 12,000 red giant branch and red clump stars from the end-of-mission Kepler catalogue with the Gaia DR3 and TIC v8.2 to obtain precise parallaxes, V- and K-band magnitudes, and E(B - V) colour excesses. Two well-tested SBCRs from the literature were adopted to estimate stellar radii. The analysis confirmed that SBCR and asteroseismic radii agree very well. The overall differences are only 1-2% depending on the adopted SBCR. The dispersion of 7% was about two-thirds of what was found for K2-based data. As a difference from the K2-based investigation, the ratio of SBCRs-to-asteroseismic radii did not depend on the metallicity [Fe/H]. Moreover, the intriguing decreasing trend with [$\alpha$/Fe] of the radius ratio for massive stars that was observed in K2 data was absent in Kepler data. The SBCR radii are systematically higher than asteroseismic estimates by 5% for stars with masses below 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. The SBCRs have proven to be a highly effective tool for estimating radii with a precision comparable to that obtained from asteroseismology, but at a significantly lower observational cost. Moreover, the superior concordance of Kepler-derived radii with SBCR measurements and the absence of the discrepancies observed in the K2-derived radii suggest the existence of underlying systematic errors that impact specific mass and metallicity regimes within the K2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Data analysis of the NISP instrument for the Euclid mission: from the first validation tests on ground up to the verification phase after launch</title>

Abstract: The Euclid telescope, launched from Cape Canaveral on July 1st, 2023, is dedicated to studying dark matter and dark energy from its orbit at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2. It is equipped with two instruments: the visual imager (VIS) and the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). The Euclid Wide Survey (Scaramella et al. 2022) will cover approximately 14500 deg2 of the extragalactic sky, and will be complemented by the Euclid Deep Survey that will cover about 40 deg2 and achieve two magnitudes fainter depth. Several ground-test campaigns were performed to assess NISP instrument basic functionalities and performances, some highlights will be reviewed in this thesis. The analysis comprises two key aspects: the evaluation of NISP image data acquired during ground-tests and during commissioning, and the verification of instrument performance in spectroscopic mode through the use of pixel-level simulated images. The analysis includes the characterisation of NISP detectors, from instrumental background to point-spread function (PSF) evaluations, confirming that NISP performance is well within the Euclid requirement. We introduce a calibration methodology to estimate the filter wheel assembly position from PSF distortions that have been successfully applied during the commissioning and will continue to be used during the mission for calibration purpose. Additionally, we investigated noise events that occur during image acquisition, with a particular focus on \v{S}snowballs\v{S} and cosmic ray tracks. Finally, we present a spectroscopic pixel-level simulation campaign of the NISP instrument, where spectral energy distributions were generated and processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of Planetary Nebulae with PG1159 central stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of 26 PNe with PG1159-type central stars known till date and compare them with the properties of PNe having [WR], $wels$ and hydrogen-rich central stars published earlier. We use archival photometric measurements of $2MASS$ for near-IR analysis and $WISE$ and $IRAS$ data for mid- and far-IR analysis and derive the IR properties of PG1159-PNe. We analyze the IR colour-colour diagrams of PG1159-PNe and compare them with the other three groups of PNe. Similar to the [WR]-PNe, many PG1159-PNe also show large amount of near-IR emission from the hot-dust component but their AGB dust is relatively cooler. We also report here the dust colour temperatures, dust masses, dust-to-gas mass ratios, IR luminosities and IR excess of PG1159-PNe and plot them against their surface H$\beta$ brightness (age) and compare them with the distribution of other groups of PNe. The IR luminosity and dust temperature show strong correlation with surface H$\beta$ brightness, however, the dust-to-gas mass ratio and IR excess do not show any trend. While the mean dust mass has a lower value for PG1159-PNe, in compared to other groups, the average dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be marginally larger for PG1159-PNe. An analysis of the number distribution of different groups of PNe against surface H$\beta$ brightness shows that a) younger [WR]-, $wels$- and normal-PNe have a similar distribution indicating that they all have evolved from the AGB in a similar way, b) while there is an overlap of surface H$\beta$ brightness between [WR]- and PG1159-PNe, showing an evolutionary connection between them, there exists a significant gap between the values derived for $wels$- and PG1159-PNe.</description>

      <title>ALMA detections of circumstellar disks in the giant Hii region M17. Probing the intermediate- to high-mass pre-main-sequence population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that intermediate- to high-mass stars form in a way similar to low-mass stars, that is, through disk accretion. However, the physical conditions that play a role in disk formation, evolution, and the possibility of (sub)stellar companion formation, are significantly different. We search for the mm counterparts of four intermediate- to high-mass (4-10 Solar mass) young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant Hii region M17 at a distance of 1.7 kpc. These objects expose their photospheric spectrum such that their location on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) is well established. They have a circumstellar disk that is likely remnant of the formation process. With ALMA we have detected, for the first time, these four YSOs in M17, in Band 6 and 7, as well as four other serendipitous objects. Besides the flux measurements, the source size and spectral index provide important constraints on the physical mechanism(s) producing the observed emission. We apply different models to estimate the dust and gas mass contained in the disks. All our detections are spatially unresolved, constraining the source size to &lt;120 au, and have a spectral index in the range 0.5-2.7. The derived (upper limits on the) disk dust masses are on the order of a few Earth masses and estimations of the upper limits on the gas mass vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$ Solar mass. In two objects (B331 and B268) free-free emission indicates the presence of ionized material around the star. The four serendipitous detections are likely (low-mass) YSOs. We compare the derived disk masses of our M17 targets to those obtained for YSOs in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) and Herbig stars, as a function of stellar mass, age, luminosity, and outer disk radius. The M17 sample, though small, is both the most massive and the youngest sample, yet has the lowest mean disk mass.</description>

      <title>The Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence. II. Need for Speed in PHOEBE Forward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE, a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding 1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the Sombrero Galaxy as an Accelerator of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the highest energy messenger from space, with energies exceeding 1 EeV. Although UHECRs were discovered over 60 years ago, their origin still remains a mystery. Pinpointing sources of UHECRs is crucial for understanding the extreme astrophysical processes that accelerate particles to such extraordinary energies. We searched for UHECR multiplets via analyzing 17 years of data with energies greater than 40 EeV from the Pierre Auger Observatory. A spatial association is found between a multiplet of $25.7^{+6.2}_{-7.0}$ cosmic rays and the Sombrero galaxy with a local (global) significance of $4.5~\sigma~(3.3~\sigma)$. The Sombrero galaxy hosts a supermassive central black hole with a mass of $\sim1\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and exhibits large-scale radio lobes and jets. Our finding provides critical evidence on active supermassive black holes as the source of the highest-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Merger Rates in AGN: contribution from gas-captu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that merging black hole (BH) binaries in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs formed through two-body scatterings via the gas-capture process may explain a significant fraction of BH mergers in AGN and a non-negligible contribution to the observed rate from LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of BH and binary BH formation, evolution and mergers across the observed AGN mass function using a novel physically motivated treatment for the gas-capture process derived from hydrodynamical simulations of BH-BH encounters in AGN and varying assumptions on the AGN disc physics. The results suggest that gas-captured binaries could result in merger rates of 0.73 - 7.1Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. Most mergers take place near the outer boundary of the accretion disk, but this may be subject to change when migration is considered. The BH merger rate in the AGN channel in the Universe is dominated by AGN with supermassive BH masses on the order of 10$^{7} M_\odot$ , with 90% of mergers occurring in the range 10$^{6} M_\odot$ - 10$^{8} M_\odot$ . The merging mass distribution is flatter than the initial BH mass power law by a factor $\Delta \xi$ = 1.1 to 1.2, as larger BHs can align with the disc and successfully form binaries more efficiently. Similarly, the merging mass ratio distribution is flatter, therefore the AGN channel could easily explain the high mass and unequal mass ratio detections such as GW190521 and GW190814. When modelling the BH binary formation process using a simpler dynamical friction treatment, we observe very similar results, where the primary bottleneck is the alignment time with the disk. We find the most influential parameters on the rates are the anticipated number of BHs and their mass function. We conclude that AGN remain an important channel for consideration, particularly for gravitational wave detections involving one or two high mass BHs.</description>

      <title>Convergence Tests of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theory predicts that dark matter halos experience core-collapse, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. The N-body simulations used to study this process can suffer from numerical errors when simulation parameters are selected incorrectly. Optimal choices for simulation parameters are well studied for cold dark matter (CDM), but are not deeply understood when self-interactions are included. In order to perform reliable N-body simulations and model core-collapse accurately we must understand the potential numerical errors, how to diagnose them, and what parameter selections must be made to reduce them. We use the \texttt{Arepo} N-body code to perform convergence tests of core-collapsing SIDM halos across a range of halo concentrations and SIDM cross-sections, and quantify potential numerical issues related to mass resolution, timestep size, and gravitational softening length. Our tests discover that halos with fewer than $10^5$ simulation particles, a resolution typically not met by subhalos in N-body simulations, suffer from significant discreteness noise that leads to variation and extreme outliers in the collapse rate. At our lowest resolution of $N=10^4$ particles, this collapse time variation can reach as high as 20\%. At this low resolution we also find a bias in collapse times and a small number of extreme outliers. Additionally, we find that simulations which run far beyond the age of the Universe, which have been used to calibrate SIDM gravothermal fluid models in previous work, have a sensitivity to the timestep size that is not present in shorter simulations or simulations using only CDM. Our work shows that choices of simulation parameters that yield converged results for some halo masses and SIDM models do not necessarily yield convergence for others.</description>

      <title>Physical Pathways for JWST-Observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with estimated masses of $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim7-9$. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds ($\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_\odot$), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Blazars, which are quasars with jets aligned along our line of sight, provide insights into the jetted population and have been observed up to redshifts of z=6.1. Here, we report the discovery and multi-wavelength characterization of the blazar VLASS J041009.05-013919.88 at z=7 (Universe's age ~750 Myr), powered by a ~7x10^8 Msun black hole. The presence of this high-redshift blazar implies a large population of similar but unaligned jetted sources in the early Universe. Our findings suggest two possible scenarios: in one, the jet in J0410-0139 is intrinsically low-power but appears highly luminous due to relativistic beaming, suggesting that most UV-bright quasars at this redshift host jets. Alternatively, if J0410-0139 represents an intrinsically powerful radio source, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at z~7 with properties similar to J0410-0139, a prediction in tension with observed quasar densities based on their UV luminosity function. These results support the hypothesis that rapid black hole growth in the early Universe may be driven by jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion, potentially playing a key role in forming massive black holes during the epoch of reionization.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf galaxy streams encode vast amounts of information essential to understanding early galaxy formation and nucleosynthesis channels. Due to the variation in the timescales of star formation history in their progenitors, stellar streams serve as `snapshots' that record different stages of galactic chemical evolution. This study focusses on the Cetus stream, stripped from a low-mass dwarf galaxy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of 22 member stars based on their high-resolution spectra. We derived abundances for up to 28 chemical species from C to Dy and, for 20 of them, we account for the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that the Cetus stream has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.11$ $\pm$ 0.21. All observed Cetus stars are $\alpha$ enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq$ 0.3. The absence of the $\alpha$-`knee' implies that star formation stopped before iron production in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) became substantial. Neutron capture element abundances suggest that both the rapid (r-) and the main slow (s-) processes contributed to their origin. The decrease in [Eu/Ba] from a typical r-process value of [Eu/Ba] = 0.7 to 0.3 with increasing [Ba/H] indicates a distinct contribution of the r- and s-processes to the chemical composition of different Cetus stars. For barium, the r-process contribution varies from 100 % to 20 % in different sample stars, with an average value of 50 %. Our abundance analysis indicates that the star formation in the Cetus progenitor ceased after the onset of the main s-process in low- to intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars but before SNe Ia played an important role. A distinct evolution scenario is revealed by comparing the abundances in the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, showing the diversity in the chemical evolution of low-mass dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>A High-resolution Far-infrared Survey to Probe Black Hole-Galaxy Co-evolution</title>

Abstract: Far-infrared (FIR) surveys are critical to probing the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies, since of order half the light from accreting black holes and active star formation is emitted in the rest-frame infrared over $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 10$. For deep fields with areas of 1 deg$^2$ or less, like the legacy surveys GOODS, COSMOS, and CANDELS, source crowding means that sub-arcsecond resolution is essential. In this paper, we show with a simulation of the FIR sky that observations made with a small telescope (2 m) at low angular resolution preferentially detect the brightest galaxies, and we demonstrate the scientific value of a space mission that would offer sub-arcsecond resolution. We envisage a facility that would provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the wavelength range $25-400\,\mu m$, and we present predictions for an extragalactic survey covering $0.5\,\hbox{deg}^2$. Such a survey is expected to detect tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies and thousands of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), in multiple FIR lines (e.g. [CII], [OI], [CI]) and continuum. At the longest wavelengths (200-400$\,\mu$m), it would probe beyond the reionization epoch, up to $z\sim 7$-8. A combination of spectral resolution, line sensitivity, and broad spectral coverage would allow us to learn about the physical conditions (temperature, density, metallicity) characterizing the interstellar medium of galaxies over the past $\sim 12$ billion years and to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of hot intragroup medium in optically selected, poor galaxy groups by eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last several decades, extensive research has been conducted on the baryon cycles within cosmic structures, encompassing a broad mass range from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. However, a notable gap in understanding the cosmic baryon cycle is the poor galaxy groups with halo masses around $10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$ (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2010). Poor galaxy groups, like our own Local Group, are prevalent throughout the universe, yet robust detection of their hot, X-ray emitting intragroup medium (IGrM) has remained elusive. The presence of this hot IGrM is crucial for addressing the long-standing "missing baryons" problem. Previous ROSAT-based studies were limited by a small number of X-ray bright samples, thus restricting the scope of their findings. Here we show a robust detection of this hot IGrM in a large, optically selected poor groups sample, based on the stacked X-ray images from the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey. These groups are identified in DESI LS with a mass range of log($M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) = 11.5-13.5 and a redshift range of z = 0.1-0.5. Additionally, our results indicate that despite its presence in virtually groups at all sizes, this gas component is still not sufficient to recover the universal baryon fraction, and hence the "missing baryons" problem still persists in poor galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>The 3D morphology of open clusters in the solar neighborhood III: Fractal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the fractal dimension of open clusters using 3D spatial data from Gaia DR3 for 93 open clusters from Pang et al. (2024) and 127 open clusters from Hunt &amp; Reffert (2024) within 500 pc. The box-counting method is adopted to calculate the fractal dimension of each cluster in three regions: the all-member region, $r \leq r_t$ (inside the tidal radius), and $r &gt; r_t$ (outside the tidal radius). In both the Pang and Hunt catalogs, the fractal dimensions are smaller for the regions $r &gt; r_t$ than those for $r \leq r_t$, indicating that the stellar distribution is more clumpy in the cluster outskirts. We classify cluster morphology based on the fractal dimension via the Gaussian Mixture Model. Our study shows that the fractal dimension can efficiently classify clusters in the Pang catalog into two groups. The fractal dimension of the clusters in the Pang catalog declines with age, which is attributed to the development of tidal tails. This is consistent with the expectations from the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We find strong evidence that the fractal dimension increases with cluster mass, which implies that higher-mass clusters are formed hierarchically from the mergers of lower-mass filamentary-type stellar groups. The transition of the fractal dimension for the spatial distribution of open clusters provides a useful tool to trace the Galactic star forming structures, from the location of the Local Bubble within the solar neighborhood to the spiral arms across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburst and launch of outflow in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 through hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve the star formation and feedback processes, avoiding the reliance on various assumed models. We probe the effects of different stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds and gas disc mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations can generate a starburst that lasts $\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. However, the total stellar mass formed in the starburst often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in two stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form small bubbles, merging into a super bubble foam composed of warm/hot gas and high-density cool filaments. After $\sim10$ Myr of SN injection, the super bubble breakout the disc, marking the second stage, which takes $\sim15$ Myr to develop a kpc-scale outflow. Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the ISM can survive from the stellar feedback, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched to hundreds pc in length. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed outflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower, and its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $\sim60\%$. Warm and hot gas are $\sim25\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of the outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow. Other factors have moderate effects. To address the shortcoming in our results, enhanced SN feedback effect due to clustered SNe is likely necessary.</description>

      <title>Transient electromagnetic sources can detect solitary black holes in Milky Way galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to host up to a billion stellar-mass solitary black holes (BHs). The number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the existence of primordial BHs, and the interpretation of gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. {Sahu et al. recently confirmed one solitary stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing}. This work proposes a novel mechanism to identify such BH by analyzing the frequency and damping of the quasi-normal modes of GW generated from the interaction of the BH and EM wave originating from a transient electromagnetic (TEM) source. The incoming EM waves distort the curvature of a BH, releasing GWs as it returns to a steady state. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the generated GWs via the \emph{Regge-Wheeler tensor} and relate the GW amplitude to the energy of the TEM. We demonstrate that isolated BHs at a distance of 50 pc from Earth can be detected by LIGO A+ and 100 pc by Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope. Additionally, we discuss the observational implications for orphan afterglows associated with GRBs, highlighting the potential for further discoveries.</description>

      <title>Jet interaction with galaxy cluster mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AGN bubbles in cool-core galaxy clusters are believed to facilitate the transport of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) throughout the cluster. Recent radio observations are revealing complex morphologies of cluster diffuse emission, potentially linked to interactions between AGN bursts and the cluster environment. We perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers and inject a bi-directional jet at the center of the main cluster. Kinetic, thermal, magnetic and CR energy are included in the jet and we use the two-fluid formalism to model the CR component. We explore a wide range of cluster merger and jet parameters. We discuss the formation of various wide-angle-tail (WAT) and X-shaped sources in the early evolution of the jet and merger. During the last phase of the evolution, we find that the CR material efficiently permeates the central region of the cluster reaching radii of $\sim1$-2 Mpc within $\sim5$-6 Gyr, depending on the merger mass ratio. We find that solenoidal turbulence dominates during the binary merger and explore the possibility for the CR jet material to be re-accelerated by super-Alfv\`enic turbulence and contribute to cluster scale radio emission. We find high volume fractions, $\gtrsim 70$\%, at which the turbulent acceleration time is shorter than the electron cooling time. Finally, we study the merger shock interaction with the CRe material and show that it is unlikely that this material significantly contributes to the radio relic emission associated with the shocks. We suggest that multiple jet outbursts and/or off-center radio galaxies would increase the likelihood of detecting these merger shocks in the radio due to shock re-acceleration.</description>

      <title>Intensity mapping of Loeb-Rybicki haloes from scattering of galactic Lyman-$\alpha$ emission by the diffuse intergalactic medium before reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the inferred evolution of Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosities of galaxies in the redshift range of $z \sim 9-16$ from the ${James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope}$ (JWST) data to predict the power spectrum of Loeb-Rybicki haloes formed by the scattering of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium expanding with the Hubble flow, until they Doppler shift out of resonance and escape towards the observer. This leads to the formation of the so-called Loeb-Rybicki intergalactic haloes, which are expected to be prominent even before the epoch of reionization. We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the intensity mapping signal from the clustering of these haloes, with current and future experiments such as the JWST, SPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in cross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation signal should be detectable at a significance of a few to a few tens of standard deviations out to $z \sim 13$ and marginally out to $z \sim 16$, using the above experiments in combination with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary-lens perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.724 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.258 +/- 0.008 M_sun and M_2 = 0.130 +/- 0.007 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 6.83 +/- 0.31 au and a distance of D_L = 2.29 +/- 0.08 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few astronomical units) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Formation Rate of Quasiperiodic Eruptions in Galactic Nuclei Containing Single and Dual Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel class of transients recently discovered in a few extragalactic nuclei. It has been suggested that a QPE can be produced by a main-sequence star undergoing repeated partial disruptions by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) immediately after getting captured on a tightly bound orbit through the Hills mechanism. In this Letter, we investigate the period-dependent formation rate of QPEs for this scenario, utilizing scattering experiments and the loss-cone theory. We calculate the QPE formation rates in both a single-SMBH and a dual-SMBH system, motivated by the overrepresentation of postmerger galaxies as QPE hosts. We find that for SMBHs of mass $10^{6}$--$10^{7}M_{\odot}$, most QPEs formed in this scenario have periods longer than $\simeq 100$ days. A single-SMBH system generally produces QPEs at a negligible rate of $10^{-10}$--$10^{-8}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$ due to inefficient two-body relaxation. Meanwhile, in a dual-SMBH system, the QPE rate is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude, mainly due to a boosted angular momentum evolution under tidal perturbation from the companion SMBH (galaxy). The QPE rate in a postmerger galactic nucleus hosting two equal-mass SMBHs separated by a few parsecs could reach $10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Our results suggest that a nonnegligible fraction ($\simeq 10$--$90\%$) of long-period QPEs should come from postmerger galaxies.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary discs around sun-like stars appear to live longer when the metallicity is low</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.</description>
