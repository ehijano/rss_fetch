      <title>Authorized Subject Headings in the Online Automatic catalog Environment An Empirical Study on a Sample of Arabic Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject headings are very important to machine catalogs, given the importance of thematic research. This study aims to measure the quality of a group of authorized subject headings with a sample of Arabic bibliographic records on the catalog of Egyptian university libraries by identifying the most important practices, policies, procedures followed, and tools used. In addition to assessing the actual capabilities of lists, thesaurus, and guidelines that were used in establishing thematic availability points. The study used both the descriptive analytical and evaluation approaches to achieve the study objectives.</description>

      <title>Data journeys in popular science: Producing climate change and COVID-19 data visualizations at Scientific American</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vast amounts of (open) data are increasingly used to make arguments about crisis topics such as climate change and global pandemics. Data visualizations are central to bringing these viewpoints to broader publics. However, visualizations often conceal the many contexts involved in their production, ranging from decisions made in research labs about collecting and sharing data to choices made in editorial rooms about which data stories to tell. In this paper, we examine how data visualizations about climate change and COVID-19 are produced in popular science magazines, using Scientific American, an established English-language popular science magazine, as a case study. To do this, we apply the analytical concept of data journeys (Leonelli, 2020) in a mixed methods study that centers on interviews with Scientific American staff and is supplemented by a visualization analysis of selected charts. In particular, we discuss the affordances of working with open data, the role of collaborative data practices, and how the magazine works to counter misinformation and increase transparency. This work provides an empirical contribution by providing insight into the data (visualization) practices of science communicators and demonstrating how the concept of data journeys can be used as an analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Thinking Outside the Black Box: Insights from a Digital Exhibition in the Humanities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main goals of Open Science is to make research more reproducible. There is no consensus, however, on what exactly "reproducibility" is, as opposed for example to "replicability", and how it applies to different research fields. After a short review of the literature on reproducibility/replicability with a focus on the humanities, we describe how the creation of the digital twin of the temporary exhibition "The Other Renaissance" has been documented throughout, with different methods, but with constant attention to research transparency, openness and accountability. A careful documentation of the study design, data collection and analysis techniques helps reflect and make all possible influencing factors explicit, and is a fundamental tool for reliability and rigour and for opening the "black box" of research.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction and Maturity Analysis of Open Source Clinical Informatics Repositories from Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of clinical informatics, the integration and utilization of software tools developed through governmental funding represent a pivotal advancement in research and application. However, the dispersion of these tools across various repositories, with no centralized knowledge base, poses significant challenges to leveraging their full potential. This study introduces an automated methodology to bridge this gap by systematically extracting GitHub repository URLs from academic papers indexed in arXiv, focusing on the field of clinical informatics. Our approach encompasses querying the arXiv API for relevant papers, cleaning extracted GitHub URLs, fetching comprehensive repository information via the GitHub API, and analyzing repository maturity based on defined metrics such as stars, forks, open issues, and contributors. The process is designed to be robust, incorporating error handling and rate limiting to ensure compliance with API constraints. Preliminary findings demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology in compiling a centralized knowledge base of NIH-funded software tools, laying the groundwork for an enriched understanding and utilization of these resources within the clinical informatics community. We propose the future integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate concise summaries and evaluations of the tools. This approach facilitates the discovery and assessment of clinical informatics tools and also enables ongoing monitoring of new and actively updated repositories, revolutionizing how researchers access and leverage federally funded software. The implications of this study extend beyond simplification of access to valuable resources; it proposes a scalable model for the dynamic aggregation and evaluation of scientific software, encouraging more collaborative, transparent, and efficient research practices in clinical informatics and beyond.</description>

      <title>pyKCN: A Python Tool for Bridging Scientific Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of research trends is pivotal for understanding scientific development on specific topics. Traditionally, this involves keyword analysis within scholarly literature, yet comprehensive tools for such analysis are scarce, especially those capable of parsing large datasets with precision. pyKCN, a Python toolkit, addresses this gap by automating keyword cleaning, extraction and trend analysis from extensive academic corpora. It is equipped with modules for text processing, deduplication, extraction, and advanced keyword co-occurrence and analysis, providing a granular view of research trends. This toolkit stands out by enabling researchers to visualize keyword relationships, thereby identifying seminal works and emerging trends. Its application spans diverse domains, enhancing scholars' capacity to understand developments within their fields. The implications of using pyKCN are significant. It offers an empirical basis for predicting research trends, which can inform funding directions, policy-making, and academic curricula.

      <title>Curious Rhythms: Temporal Regularities of Wikipedia Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wikipedia, in its role as the world's largest encyclopedia, serves a broad range of information needs. Although previous studies have noted that Wikipedia users' information needs vary throughout the day, there is to date no large-scale, quantitative study of the underlying dynamics. The present paper fills this gap by investigating temporal regularities in daily consumption patterns in a large-scale analysis of billions of timezone-corrected page requests mined from English Wikipedia's server logs, with the goal of investigating how context and time relate to the kind of information consumed. First, we show that even after removing the global pattern of day-night alternation, the consumption habits of individual articles maintain strong diurnal regularities. Then, we characterize the prototypical shapes of consumption patterns, finding a particularly strong distinction between articles preferred during the evening/night and articles preferred during working hours. Finally, we investigate topical and contextual correlates of Wikipedia articles' access rhythms, finding that article topic, reader country, and access device (mobile vs. desktop) are all important predictors of daily attention patterns. These findings shed new light on how humans seek information on the Web by focusing on Wikipedia as one of the largest open platforms for knowledge and learning, emphasizing Wikipedia's role as a rich knowledge base that fulfills information needs spread throughout the day, with implications for understanding information seeking across the globe and for designing appropriate information systems.</description>
