      <title>On Graph Grammars and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph grammars form an interesting area of research because of their versatility in modelling diverse situations with graphs as the structures which are to be manipulated. A new class of graph grammars, nc-eNCE Graph Grammars has been introduced recently with an aim of restricting the order of application of graph production rules, thereby generating different graph classes using the same set of rules. On the other hand 2D game design using an algorithmic approach known as procedural content generation has been of interest recently. In this paper we modify the structure of nc-eNCE graph grammars with the aim of generating directed graphs. We show that employing these graph grammars simplifies the design of 2D games. We have also developed an algorithm which makes use of these graph grammars for generating random game level layouts ensuring that the players will get a different gaming experience each time they play.</description>

      <title>The Word Problem for Finitary Automaton Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finitary automaton group is a group generated by an invertible, deterministic finite-state letter-to-letter transducer whose only cycles are self-loops at an identity state. We show that, for this presentation of finite groups, the uniform word problem is coNP-complete. Here, the input consists of a finitary automaton together with a finite state sequence and the question is whether the sequence acts trivially on all input words. Additionally, we also show that the respective compressed word problem, where the state sequence is given as a straight-line program, is PSpace-complete. In both cases, we give a direct reduction from the satisfiability problem for (quantified) boolean formulae and we further show that the problems remain complete for their respective classes if we restrict the input alphabet of the automata to a binary one.</description>

      <title>Kleene Theorems for Lasso Languages and $\omega$-Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automata operating on pairs of words were introduced as an alternative way of capturing acceptance of regular $\omega$-languages. Families of DFAs and lasso automata operating on such pairs followed, giving rise to minimisation algorithms, a Myhill-Nerode theorem and language learning algorithms. Yet Kleene theorems for such a well-established class are still missing. We introduce rational lasso languages and expressions, show a Kleene theorem for lasso languages and explore the connection between rational lasso and $\omega$-expressions, which yields a Kleene theorem for $\omega$-languages with respect to saturated lasso automata. For one direction of the Kleene theorems, we also provide a Brzozowski construction for lasso automata from rational lasso expressions.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Reactive Strategies Resilient to Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare games under delayed control and delay games, two types of infinite games modelling asynchronicity in reactive synthesis. In games under delayed control both players suffer from partial informedness due to symmetrically delayed communication, while in delay games, the protagonist has to grant lookahead to the alter player. Our first main result, the interreducibility of the existence of sure winning strategies for the protagonist, allows to transfer known complexity results and bounds on the delay from delay games to games under delayed control, for which no such results had been known. We furthermore analyse existence of randomized strategies that win almost surely, where this correspondence between the two types of games breaks down. In this setting, some games surely won by the alter player in delay games can now be won almost surely by the protagonist in the corresponding game under delayed control, showing that it indeed makes a difference whether the protagonist has to grant lookahead or both players suffer from partial informedness. These results get even more pronounced when we finally address the quantitative goal of winning with a probability in $[0,1]$. We show that for any rational threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$ there is a game that can be won by the protagonist with exactly probability $\theta$ under delayed control, while being surely won by alter in the delay game setting. All these findings refine our original result that games under delayed control are not determined.</description>
