      <title>Initial ideals of weighted forms and the genus of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let C be a locally Cohen-Macaulay curve in complex projective 3-space. The maximum genus problem predicts the largest possible arithmetic genus g(d,s) that C can achieve assuming that it has degree d and does not lie on surfaces of degree less than s. In this paper, we prove that this prediction is correct when d=s or d is at least 2s-1. We obtain this result by proving another conjecture, by Beorchia, Lella, and the second author, about initial ideals associated to certain homogeneous forms in a non-standard graded polynomial ring.</description>

      <title>King's Conjecture and Birational Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We state and prove a birational realization of King's Conjecture for a category glued from the derived categories of all birational models in the GKZ fan of a toric variety. Our perspective extends ideas of Beilinson and Bondal to all semiprojective toric varieties. As a result, we obtain new and birationally-uniform applications to resolutions of the diagonal, categorical and noncommutative resolutions, monads, Frobenius generation, and window categories.</description>

      <title>Connected ideals of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $t\geq 2$, the $t$-independence complex of a graph $G$ is the collection of all $A\subseteq V(G)$ such that each connected component of the induced subgraph $G[A]$ has at most $t-1$ vertices. The Stanley-Reisner ideal $I_{t}(G)$ of the $t$-independence complex of $G$, called $t$-connected ideal, is generated by monomials in a polynomial ring $R$ corresponding to all $A\subseteq V(G)$ of size $t$ such that $G[A]$ is connected. This class of ideals is a natural generalization of the edge ideals of graphs. In this paper, we investigate the $t$-connected ideals of chordal graphs. In particular, we prove that for a chordal graph $G$ and for all $t$
  \[
  \mathrm{reg}(R/I_{t}(G))=(t-1)\nu_{t}(G) \text{ and } \mathrm{pd}(R/I_{t}(G))=\mathrm{bight}(I_{t}(G)),
  \]
  where $\nu_{t}(G)$ denotes the induced matching number of the corresponding hypergraph of $I_{t}(G)$, and $\mathrm{reg}$, $\mathrm{pd}$ and $\mathrm{bight}$ stand for the regularity, projective dimension, and big height, respectively. As a consequence of the above results, we completely characterize when the $t$-connected ideal of a chordal graph has a linear resolution as well as when it satisfies the Cohen-Macaulay property. The above formulas and their consequences can be seen as a nice generalization of the classical results corresponding to the edge ideals of chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Strongly robustness of toric ideals of weighted oriented cycles sharing a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the strongly robust property of toric ideals of weighted oriented graphs. Let $D$ be a weighted oriented graph consists of weighted oriented cycles (balanced or unbalanced) sharing a single vertex $v$ and $D^{\prime}$ be a weighted oriented graph consists of $D$ and a finite number of disjoint cycles such that each of these cycles is connected by a path at the sharing vertex $v$ of $D$. Then we show that the toric ideals $I_D,I_{D^{\prime}}$ of $D$ and $D^{\prime}$ respectively, are strongly robust and hence robust. That is, for the toric ideal $I_D$, of $D$, its Graver basis is a minimal generating set of $I_D$. If $D$ is a weighted oriented three cycles sharing a single vertex, then We explicitly give a unique minimal generating set of primitive binomials of $I_D$ in terms of minors of the incidence matrix of $D$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $v$ be a discrete valuation of a field $K$, which indicates that the valuation group of $v$ is isomorphic to the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with the natural order, and let $L$ be a finite separable extension of $K$ with a complete set $\{V_1,V_2,...,V_g\}$ of extended valuations of $v$. Then it is well-known that the following basic equation holds: \[\sum_{j=1}^{g} e_jf_j= [L:K],\] where $e_j$ and $f_j$ denote the ramification index and the relative degree for each $j$, respectively. We extend this result to the case when $v$ is a semi-discrete valuation, indicating that the valuation group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n\ (n\geq 1)$ with lexicographic order. As a corollary to this result, we show that it is necessary and sufficient for the integral closure $D$ of the valuation ring $A$ of $v$ to be a free $A$-module that all prime ideals of $D$ other than the maximal ideals are unramified.</description>

      <title>A family of simplicial resolutions which are DG-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each monomial ideal over a polynomial ring admits a free resolution which has the structure of a DG-algebra, namely, the Taylor resolution. A pivot resolution of a monomial ideal, which we introduce, is a resolution that is always shorter than the Taylor resolution (unless the Taylor resolution is as short as possible) but still retains a DG-algebra structure. We study the basic properties of this family of resolutions including a characterization of when the construction is minimal. Following the work of Sobieska, we use the explicit nature of pivot resolutions to give formulae for the Eisenbud-Shamash construction of a free resolution of a given monomial ideal over complete intersections.</description>
