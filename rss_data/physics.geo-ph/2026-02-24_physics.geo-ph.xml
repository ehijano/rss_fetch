      <title>Hearing the forest for the trees: machine learning and topological acoustics for remote sensing with seismic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring remote forests is a global challenge central to climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation, yet satellite observations are frequently limited by weather, dense canopies, and solar dependency. Here we show that passive seismic sensing offers a persistent, all-weather alternative for autonomous ecosystem monitoring by capturing characteristic learnable signatures of trees within the ambient wavefield. Using seismic data from Alaska, we demonstrate that cross-correlations between stations provide a physical basis for forest detection by approximating the empirical Green's function of the medium. Supervised machine learning models applied to these data achieve a classification accuracy of 86%, identifying key discriminating frequencies (35 to 60 Hz) consistent with known forest-wave interactions. A topological acoustics analysis of the geometric phase change independently confirms the physical origin of these data-driven classifications. Together, these results provide the first demonstration that subtle forest-wave interactions manifest in ambient seismic noise and can be harnessed as a scalable tool for continuous vegetation monitoring, offering a robust solution for tracking environmental change challenging regions.</description>

      <title>The Martian mid-latitude subsurface ice is the remnant of a past ice sheet</title>

Abstract: On Mars, a relatively pure water ice layer lies beneath several centimeters of dry soil at mid-latitudes. Its widespread presence poleward of 60{\deg} latitude was detected by remote neutron spectroscopy and confirmed by the Phoenix lander at 68{\deg}N. Recent observations of exposed ice indicate that the near-surface ice layer extends to 35{\deg} latitude and exhibits pronounced spatial structure. However, previous models did not capture the observed spatial structure of the midlatitude ice layer. Here, on the basis of improved calculations using the Mars Planetary Climate Model, we show that mid-latitude buried ice could be the remnant of a ice layer deposited on the surface when the obliquity was higher than today. Assuming that the ice subsequently sublimated and became buried beneath a sublimation lag, we estimate that surface ice emplaced 630 kyr (4.18 Myr) ago at 35{\deg} obliquity (40{\deg}), at latitudes of 40-55{\deg}N, would today reside at depths of 25-150 (41-255) cm, depending on the regolith and ice properties. For ice emplaced 630 kyr ago, the modeled burial depths align with observations and capture the observed longitudinal depth variations, in contrast to ice emplaced 4.18 Myr ago. We therefore infer that the mid-latitude subsurface ice is younger than 4 Myr.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws, fluxes, and symmetries: lessons from a perturbative approach for self-organized turbulence</title>

Abstract: Some turbulent flows self-organize into large-scale structures, rather than breaking up into ever-smaller scales. Underpinning this phenomenon is the existence of two sign-definite quantities which are conserved by the dynamics. Two-dimensional turbulence is a prime example, where large-scale mean flows, termed condensates, spontaneously emerge. We review a perturbative theoretical framework for the statistical description of such inhomogeneous turbulence, offering new perspectives on the role of the two conserved quantities. We illustrate the universal properties of the theory, comparing results from two-dimensional Navier-Stokes to those from the large-scale-quasi-geostrophic equation. These two models are limiting cases of the shallow water quasi-geostrophic equation, the former exhibiting long-range fluid element interactions, while the latter has local interactions. We then demonstrate these theoretical ideas in two new settings: first, in rotating three-dimensional turbulence, where two-dimensional condensates are known to form. Considering jet-type condensates, we derive the mean-flow profile and discuss a surprising symmetry breaking. Second, we vary the Rossby deformation radius in the shallow water quasi-geostrophic equation. We obtain novel domain-spanning condensates in all tested regimes and show that they follow two-dimensional Navier-Stokes for deformation radii above the forcing scale, and the large-scale quasi-geostrophic equation for those below, demonstrating the power of these asymptotic models.</description>

      <title>Did lunar tides sustain the early Earth's dynamo?</title>

Abstract: Geological data show that, early in its history, the Earth had a large-scale magnetic field with an amplitude comparable to the one of the present geomagnetic field. However, its origin remains enigmatic and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the Earth's field over geological time scales. Here, we critically evaluate whether tidal forcing could explain the ancient geodynamo, by combining constraints from geophysical models of the Earth-Moon system and predictions from turbulence studies. Our analysis shows that lunar tidal forcing could have been sufficiently strong before $-3.25$ Gy to trigger turbulence within the Earth's core, and potentially to sustain dynamo action during that interval. Then, we propose new scaling laws for the magnetic field amplitude $B$. We expect the latter to scale as $B \propto \beta^{4/3}$, where $\beta$ is the equatorial ellipticity of the liquid core, if the turbulence involves weak interactions of three-dimensional inertial waves. Alternatively, in the regime of strong tidal forcing, the expected scaling becomes $B \propto \beta$. When extrapolated to the Earth's core, it suggests that tidal forcing alone was too weak to possibly explain the ancient geomagnetic field. Therefore, our study indirectly favours another origin for the early Earth's dynamo on long time scales (e.g. exsolution of light elements atop the core, or thermal convection due to secular cooling).</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a 25-Year Pseudo-Prospective Earthquake Forecasting Experiment in China (AoyuX)</title>

Abstract: Forecast models in statistical seismology are commonly evaluated with log-likelihood scores of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake numbers, yet heavy tails and out-of-range observations can bias model ranking. We develop a tail-aware evaluation framework that estimates cell-wise P(n) using adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimation and tests three strategies for handling out-of-range counts. Using the AoyuX platform, we perform a ~25-year month-by-month pseudo-prospective forecast experiment in the China Seismic Experimental Site (CSES), comparing Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model with a homogeneous background (ETAS{\mu}) to a spatially heterogeneous variant (ETAS{\mu}(x,y)) across six spatial resolutions and five magnitude thresholds. Empirical probability density functions (PDFs) of counts per cell are well described by power laws with exponents a = 1.40 +- 0.21 across all settings. Using previous theoretical results, this provides a robust estimate of the productivity exponent, {\alpha} = 0.57 +- 0.08 using a b-value equal to 0.8, providing a valuable quantification of this key parameter in aftershock modeling. Model ranking is sensitive to how the tail of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake counts is treated: power law extrapolation is both theoretically justified and empirically the most robust. Cumulative information gain (CIG) shows that ETAS{\mu}(x,y) outperforms ETAS{\mu} in data-rich configurations, whereas in data-poor settings stochastic fluctuations dominate. A coefficient-of-variation analysis of per-window log-likelihood differences distinguishes genuine upward trends in CIG from noise-dominated fluctuations. By aligning a fat-tail-aware scoring methodology with an open testing platform, our work advances fair and statistically grounded assessment of earthquake forecasting models for the CSES and beyond.</description>

      <title>Helicity controls the direction of fluxes in rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence sustains out-of-equilibrium energy fluxes shaped by conservation laws. Three-dimensional flows conserve energy and sign-indefinite helicity, both being transferred to small scales. Yet in 3D rotating turbulence, energy is observed to flow simultaneously toward large-scale two-dimensional structures and toward small-scale three-dimensional waves. We uncover the origin of this dual behavior. When sufficiently fast inertial waves interact with a large-scale 2D flow, they conserve their helicity separately by sign, enforcing an inverse transfer of energy from 3D waves to 2D motions and promoting spectral condensation. Slower modes, by contrast, exchange helicity across opposite-sign sectors and thus behave as in non-rotating turbulence, driving a forward transfer. Using a mean-wave kinetic theory, we derive analytical expressions for these competing bi-directional transfers and quantitatively predict the rotation- and Reynolds-number dependence of the large-scale 2D flow in fully nonlinear simulations, unifying the picture from zero to infinite rotation.</description>
