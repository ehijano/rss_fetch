      <title>Reconstructing Gamma-ray Energy Distributions from PEDRO Pair Spectrometer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons emitted from high-energy electron beam interactions with high-field systems, such as the upcoming FACET-II experiments at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, may provide deep insight into the electron beam's underlying dynamics at the interaction point. With high-energy photons being utilized to generate electron-positron pairs in a novel spectrometer, there remains a key problem of interpreting the spectrometer's raw data to determine the energy distribution of the incoming photons. This paper uses data from simulations of the primary radiation emitted from electron interactions with a high-field, short-pulse laser to determine optimally reliable methods of reconstructing the measured photon energy distributions. For these measurements, recovering the emitted 10 MeV to 10 GeV photon energy spectra from the pair spectrometer currently being commissioned requires testing multiple methods to finalize a pipeline from the spectrometer data to incident photon and, by extension, electron beam information. In this study, we compare the performance QR decomposition, a matrix deconstruction technique and neural network with and without maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Although QR decomposition proved to be the most effective theoretically, combining machine learning and MLE proved to be superior in the presence of noise, indicating its promise for analysis pipelines involving high-energy photons.</description>

      <title>Emittance Measurements with Wire Scanners in the Fermilab Side-coupled Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermilab Side-Coupled Linac accelerates H-beam from 116 MeV to 400 MeV through seven 805 MHz modules. Twelve wire scanners are present in the Side Coupled Linac and four are present in the transfer line between the Linac and the Booster synchrotron ring. These wire scanners act as important diagnostic instruments to directly collect information on the beam's transverse distribution. The manipulation of the conditions of wire scanner data collection enables further characterization of the beamline, such as calculating emittance and the Twiss parameters of the beam at select regions, which we present here.</description>

      <title>Performance of PIP-II High-beta 650 Cryomodule After Transatlantic Shipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After shipment to the Daresbury Lab and return to Fermilab, the prototype HB650 cryomodule underwent another phase of 2K RF testing to ascertain any performance issues that may have arisen from the transport of the cryomodule. While measurements taken at room temperature after the conclusion of shipment indicated that there were no negative impacts on cavity alignment, beamline vacuum, or cavity frequency, testing at 2K was required to validate other aspects such as tuner operation, cavity coupling, cryogenic system integrity, and cavity performance. Results of this latest round of limited 2K testing will be presented.</description>

      <title>Performance and tolerance study of the rectilinear cooling channel for a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The muon collider has the potential to be a powerful tool for the exploration of frontiers in particle physics. In order to reach high luminosity, the 6D emittance of the muon beam needs to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. The cooling process for a muon collider involves two parts; initial six-dimensional cooling and final transverse cooling. This paper focuses on the former and proposes a conceptual design of the rectilinear cooling channel with additional dipole magnets. In this paper, we first introduce a general method for designing the rectilinear cooling channel. Subsequently, we apply this method to develop two rectilinear cooling channels before and after a bunch merging system. Furthermore, we investigate the impact on cooling performance by employing $\pi$-mode RF cavities and considering the effect of errors in the magnetic and RF fields.</description>

      <title>Beam Breakup Instability Studies of Powerful Energy Recovery Linac for Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum achievable beam current in an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) is often constrained by Beam Breakup (BBU) instability. Our previous research highlighted that filling patterns have a substantial impact on BBU instabilities in multi-pass ERLs. In this study, we extend our investigation to the 8-cavity model of the Powerful ERL for Experiment (PERLE). We evaluate its requirements for damping cavity Higher Order Modes (HOMs) and propose optimal filling patterns and bunch timing strategies. Our findings reveal a significant new insight: while filling patterns are crucial, the timing of bunches also plays a critical role in mitigating HOM beam loading and BBU instability. This previously underestimated factor is essential for effective BBU control. We estimated the PERLE threshold current using both analytical and numerical models, incorporating the designed PERLE HOM dampers. During manufacturing, HOM frequencies are expected to vary slightly, with an assumed RMS frequency jitter of 0.001 between cavities for the same HOM. Introducing this jitter into our models, we found that the dampers effectively suppressed BBU instability, achieving a threshold current an order of magnitude higher than the design requirement. Our results offer new insights into ERL BBU beam dynamics and have important implications for the design of future ERLs.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional phase space tomography from one-dimensional measurements in a high-power hadron ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use one-dimensional measurements to infer the four-dimensional phase space density of an accumulated 1 GeV proton beam in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator. The reconstruction was performed using MENT, an exact maximum-entropy tomography algorithm, and thus represents the most reasonable inference from the data. The reconstructed distribution reproduces the measured profiles with the same dynamic range as the measurement devices, and simulations indicate that the problem is well-constrained. Similar measurements could serve as benchmarks for simulations of intense, coupled beam dynamics in the SNS or other hadron rings.</description>
