      <title>Numerical Assessment of Advective and Diffusive Dynamics of Interacting and Isolated Prototypical Convectively Initiated Circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk circulation associated with convective clouds includes not only a region of updraft and cloudy air but also a region of compensating descent and cloud-free air and horizontal motions coupling these regions. The Kinematic Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model is a simple representation of this entire flow. First, the skill of the KRoNUT in representing flows from a high resolution full-physics simulation of marine tropical convection is compared to various plume representations of convection. Then the KRoNUT is used to construct bulk descriptions of the dry dynamics of isolated and interacting convective circulations under the influence of advection and diffusion (only). Cross sections of advective and diffusive tendencies show that while vertical advection of the vertical wind is the most important advective tendency in clouds, the horizontal component of the convective circulation and advection thereof plays a crucial role in the evolution of circulations in the absence of buoyancy. Strong curvature of the flow near the surface and near the updraft core results in locally strong diffusive tendencies that depend on scale. Cross sections of tendencies from the KRoNUT compare favourably to results from the simulation. Interacting circulations are shown to exhibit a wide range of dynamics with some cases of interactions leading to unique stability of geometric properties of otherwise evolving flows and some leading to geometric clustering of circulation centers.</description>

      <title>Considerations of Earth climate sensitivity based on peculiarities of planetary heat capacity using system identification method: Runaway greenhouse effect scenario is still possible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification method (SIM) was used to evaluate the Earth equilibrium climate sensitivity. According to our simulations, the equilibrium climate sensitivity was found to be between 2 deg C and 7 deg C. Analysis of the changes in heat inventory of oceans, atmosphere, land, and cryosphere was based on the experimental data of IPCC6.
  The equation derived for Earth's global surface temperature (GST) shows that the sum of the dimensionless feedback coefficients from water vapor, methane, and Earth albedo could be less than 1. However, due to the positive feedback from carbon dioxide (the combined greenhouse catastrophe) and the revised equilibrium climate sensitivity estimate based on an increase in equilibrium climate sensitivity, the probability of the runaway greenhouse effect increases significantly. It is still less than the critical number when not considering the feedback associated with carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane buildup in Earth's atmosphere.
  The analysis considers the thermal dynamics of the oceans and other factors, including the exponential growth of the Earth's global temperature based on IPCC6 data.</description>

      <title>MeltwaterBench: Deep learning for spatiotemporal downscaling of surface meltwater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Greenland ice sheet is melting at an accelerated rate due to processes that are not fully understood and hard to measure. The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as "ground truth", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods. The code and data are available at $\href{https://github.com/blutjens/hrmelt}{github.com/blutjens/hrmelt}$.</description>

      <title>Balancing Accuracy and Speed: A Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Machine Learning Surrogate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.</description>

      <title>Skillful Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Forecasting of Extreme Events with a Multi-Sphere Coupled Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction of extreme events is critical for resource planning and disaster mitigation under accelerating climate change. However, such predictions remain challenging due to complex multi-sphere interactions and intrinsic atmospheric uncertainty. Here we present TianXing-S2S, a multi-sphere coupled probabilistic model for global S2S daily ensemble forecast. TianXing-S2S first encodes diverse multi-sphere predictors into a compact latent space, then employs a diffusion model to generate daily ensemble forecasts. A novel coupling module based on optimal transport (OT) is incorporated in the denoiser to optimize the interactions between atmospheric and multi-sphere boundary conditions. Across key atmospheric variables, TianXing-S2S outperforms both the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S system and FuXi-S2S in 45-day daily-mean ensemble forecasts at 1.5 resolution. Our model achieves skillful subseasonal prediction of extreme events including heat waves and anomalous precipitation, identifying soil moisture as a critical precursor signal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TianXing-S2S can generate stable rollout forecasts up to 180 days, establishing a robust framework for S2S research in a warming world.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of the Tornadic Supercell in the Province of Pampanga, Philippines (27 May 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20559v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides an integrated damage assessment, visual evaluation, environmental context, and remote sensing analysis of the tornado event that struck the suburb of Candating in Arayat, Pampanga on 27 May 2024. Satellite imagery and ground-level damage photographs reveal a $\sim$2 km path, with damage reaching EF2 intensity at one point along the track, based on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale. Videos of the tornado and its parent storm reveal a well-defined wall cloud and low-level mesocyclone. Subsequent radar analysis supports these and other features of a tornadic supercell. Synoptic-scale ascent in the mid- and upper-troposphere was subtle, influenced by the approach of Tropical Cyclone Ewiniar. However, a modest meridional flow aloft provided sufficient deep-layer shear to support supercell development. The southwest monsoon acted as a low-level jet, promoting warm, moist advection into western Luzon. The supercell developed around midday and was characterized by large-undiluted instability, attributed to steep low-level lapse rates. Although low-level shear and the associated near-surface horizontal vorticity were weak, the latter is highly streamwise, allowing for efficient ingestion, tilting, and stretching into vertical vorticity, which aided in tornadogenesis. Both satellite and radar data suggest that storm interactions, such as a nudging mechanism and terrain effects from nearby Mt. Arayat may have contributed to the initiation and intensification of the supercell through lee-side convergence and vorticity enhancement. The complex tropical environment of the Candating, Arayat tornado exhibits several similarities to well-documented tornadic events in North America. These findings highlight the need for further research into the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornadic activity in the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Estimating Vertical Velocity in Convective Updrafts from Temperature, Pressure, and Latent Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertical velocity in convective clouds ($w_c$) mediates convective anvil development and global moisture transport, influencing Earth's energy budget, but has yet to be estimated globally over long periods due to the absence of spaceborne retrievals. Here, a method for estimating $w_c$ given vertical profiles of in-cloud temperature, pressure, and latent heating rate is presented and assessed. The method relies on analytical models for the approximately linear relationship between $w_c$ and condensation rate ($\dot{q}_{vc}$) in convective clouds, which we derive from steady-state and non-steady-state plume models. We include in our analysis a version of $\dot{q}_{vc}/w_c$ derived from the supersaturation rate in convective clouds, recently presented in Kukulies et al. (2024). We assess the accuracy of $w_c$ estimates against convective cloud simulations run with different model cores and spatial resolutions in both tropical and mid-latitude environments. Increased errors mid-latitude environments suggest that this approach for estimating $w_c$ leads to higher uncertainties in the mid-latitudes. Despite assumptions in the analytical expressions that theoretically restrict them to liquid water clouds, $w_c$ is estimated to within $\approx1$ m/s for most samples in the tropics. Potential applications, validation against future satellite mission observables, and future approaches for improving the estimation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of the resonant wave interaction approximation with simulated dynamics of idealized 2D internal wave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02758v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear interaction and breaking of internal ocean waves are responsible for much of the interior ocean mixing, affecting ocean carbon storage and the global overturning circulation. These interactions may affect the observed Garrett-Munk wave energy spectrum, in addition to the recently explored interaction of waves with ocean eddies. According to the resonant wave interaction approximation, that is commonly used to derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum, the dominant interactions are between wave triads whose wavevectors satisfy $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{q}$, and whose frequencies satisfy $\omega_{\mathbf{k}}=|\omega_{\mathbf{p}}\pm\omega_{\mathbf{q}}|$. In order to test the validity of the resonant wave interaction approximation, we examine several analytical derivations of the theory. The assumptions underlying each derivation are tested using idealized direct 2D numerical simulations, representing near-observed energy levels of the oceanic internal wave field. We show that the slow-amplitude assumptions underlying the derivations are inconsistent with the simulated dynamics in this particular set of simulations. In addition, most of the triads satisfying the resonant conditions do not contribute significantly to nonlinear wave energy transfer in our simulations, while some interactions that are dominant in nonlinear energy transfers do not satisfy the resonance conditions. We also point to possible self-consistency issues with some derivations found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a unified conceptual and observational framework that reinterprets these radiation bursts as manifestations of the same runaway processes happening at different atmospheric depths (Dual-stage model, DSM). We review recent results from satellite (ASIM), aircraft (ALOFT), balloon (HELEN), and ground-based (SEVAN and KANAZAWA) experiments to demonstrate the advantages of this integrated approach. This study addresses key contradictions in the field, introduces new classification criteria based on physics rather than detector location, and enhances our understanding of particle acceleration in thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>China Regional 3km Downscaling Based on Residual Corrective Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in numerical weather prediction is to efficiently produce high-resolution forecasts. A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 40 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.</description>
