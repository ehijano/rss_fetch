      <title>A generalized semi-analytic model for the combined outflow from a cluster of stars with strong stellar winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive semi-analytic solutions for the thermally driven cumulative outflow from a dense stellar cluster that consists of a large number of stars with strong stellar winds, under the key assumption that their mass and energy deposition can be treated as a continuous source of thermalized wind material. Our approach provides explicit analytic forms for the flow critical radius and sound speed, which then allows for full solution by inward/outward integration from this critical radius. Application to previous models that assume either a power-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their velocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass depositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by Plummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius scaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar, asymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and anchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By deriving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain scaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling generally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from adiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization suggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in dense clusters. The simplified semi-analytic method presented here can be readily applied to alternative mass depositions and so form a basis for interpreting results from detailed numerical simulations of outflows from young stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>On the protostellar mass-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a preliminary view of the protostellar mass-luminosity relation using current samples of protostars with dynamical mass estimates. To provide a lower limit to the expected luminosities, we adopt an empirical estimate for the intrinsic (without accretion) protostellar luminosity and radius as a function of mass. We find that many of the protostars with current dynamical mass estimates track the empirical mass-luminosity "birthline" reasonably closely, suggesting that their accretion luminosities may be at most comparable to their photospheric radiation. In turn, this implies that mass accretion rates for many objects are well below that required to build up the final stellar mass in typical estimated protostellar lifetimes. A small subset of the protostars have luminosities well above the predicted photospheric values, consistent with evolutionarily-important mass addition. These results hint at a possible bimodal distribution of accretion, but a firm conclusion is not possible given the small size of and likely biases in the current sample.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi I: Interpretation and Model Comparison of the Type II Supernova 2024ggi at 55 days Past Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (~7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at ~55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.</description>

      <title>From the light curves of Long Period Variables to their evolution along the AGB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of 116 Long Period Variables is studied with the aim to reveal relations between the properties of their light curves and of their evolution along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Each light curve is carefully scrutinized and its properties are summarized in a set of five parameters. The picture that had been sketched in an earlier work is clarified and new features are revealed. In particular, the evolution on the AGB of stars having not yet experienced a third dredge-up event is shown to go together with a closely related path followed by the light curve in the parameter space. Moreover, evidence is found for the existence of two different types of light curves for stars having experienced dredge-up events strong enough for their impact to be detectable. Interpretations are proposed, however often too speculative to be firmly ascertained: the results presented raise several unanswered questions and point to the need for new observations and analyses, suggesting that light curves still carry more messages and information than has been currently possible to decrypt.</description>

      <title>Injection of magnetic helicity in solar cycle 24 and early phase of cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injection of magnetic helicity into the heliosphere during solar cycle 24 and the early phase of cycle 25 has been calculated based on the analysis of a series of synoptic magnetic charts. During the cycle, the injected magnetic helicity is found to be mainly contributed by the magnetic field in active regions. According to Hale's law, the polarities of active regions statistically reverse between solar cycles 24 and 25. We suggest that the dominant source of injected magnetic helicity likely arises from the relatively strong magnetic fields of the leading polarity of active regions. This occurs as part of the magnetic field that migrates to high latitudes and the polar regions of the Sun due to the effect of meridional circulation inferred from a series of HMI/SDO magnetic synoptic charts. Significant fluctuations of the injected magnetic helicity from the subsurface layers may reflect the complex processes of how the twist from the convection zone ejects magnetic fields through a series of active regions on different temporal and spatial scales at the solar surface.</description>

      <title>First coordinated observations between Solar Orbiter and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Orbiter and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) are two of the newest facilities available to the solar physics community. The first coordinated observations of the Sun by these two facilities occurred over the course of one week in October 2022. The returned data are open-access and will provide a valuable resource to researchers in the field.
  We provide an overview of the datasets collected by Solar Orbiter and DKIST through this coordination and discuss their scientific potential. Our aim is to demonstrate how these unique high-resolution coordinated observations, as well as similar observations obtained through subsequent campaigns, can help tackle important science questions in the field.
  Between 18 and 24 October 2022, Solar Orbiter and DKIST observed a decayed active region simultaneously. During this period, Solar Orbiter's separation angle with Earth decreased from 77{\deg} to 51{\deg}, enabling stereoscopic observations with DKIST. From Solar Orbiter, observations are provided by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI), and the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instruments. Meanwhile, DKIST observed using the Cryogenic Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (CryoNIRSP), the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI), and the Visible Spectropolarimeter (ViSP).
  The first coordinated Solar Orbiter and DKIST campaign was a success, collecting observations multiple times over the week. We focus on three specific topics as representative examples, namely, coronal loop physics, the formation and evolution of the small-scale active region brightenings, and coronal rain dynamics.
  These open-access observations, and others like them, should help the solar physics community tackle key questions in the field. Such stereoscopic coordinated observations open up a new era in the analysis of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared characterization of evolved massive stars in M31 and M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is populated by massive stars in a diversity of evolutionary stages, and the classification of these stars is often based on observed characteristics exclusively in the optical spectral range. The near-infrared regime provides useful complementary information that can help resolving ambiguities in stellar classification and add valuable information about circumstellar envelopes or late-type companions. We present new, near-infrared medium-resolution K-band spectra for a sample of six evolved massive stars, four in M31 and two in M33. The spectra are obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) at the Gemini North telescope. We detect CO band emission from the environment of two M31 objects, J004320.97+414039.6 and J004621.08+421308.2, which we classify as B[e] supergiants, with J004320.97+414039.6 being most likely in a post-red supergiant stage. Two objects have pure emission from the hydrogen Pfund series. Of these, we propose that J004415.00+420156.2 in M31 could also be a B[e] supergiant while J013410.93+303437.6 (Var 83) is a well-known luminous blue variable (LBV) in M33. The M31 star J004229.87+410551.8 has a featureless spectrum and its evolutionary stage remains inconclusive; it could be an LBV undergoing an S Dor cycle. The object J013242.26+302114.1 in M33 displays a pure absorption spectrum, including CO bands, consistent with its identification as a cool star. Radial velocity measurements of this red component, combined with modelling of the spectral energy distribution, suggest that J013242.26+302114.1 may be a binary system consisting of an LBV or B[e] supergiant primary and a red supergiant secondary. If confirmed, it would represent the first of its kind.</description>

      <title>Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: II. Reconstruction of sample probability density of true orbit sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide binary stars are important for testing alternative models of gravitation in the weak-field regime and understanding the statistical outcomes of dynamical interactions in the general Galactic field. The Gaia mission's collection of weakly bound pairs of stars offers a unique opportunity to estimate the rate of survivors at separations above 7 KAU, where non-Newtonian components of gravitation may become important. The available Gaia-based catalogs of resolved binaries provide the projected angular separation between the components, while the physical semimajor axis is the parameter of interest. The problem of reconstructing the distribution of orbit sizes is complex and ill-posed, because the observed apparent separations are defined by a number of underlying physical parameters including semimajor axis, eccentricity, orbit orientation, and orbital phase. Methods of inverse reconstruction of the marginal distribution of semimajor axes from the available data are proposed and implemented with two different strategies, namely, a direct Monte Carlo mapping and inverse filtering with impulse updates without regularization. We find rather similar results from the two methods for the outlying tail of the distribution, suggesting that the rate of orbit sizes is a shallow declining function on a logarithmic scale. A finite rate of extremely wide binaries is implied.</description>

      <title>Long-term Optical Photometry of V709 Cas Using TESS : Refined Periods and Accretion Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing high-cadence and long-term optical photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ), we conducted a time-resolved timing analysis of the Intermediate Polar, V709 Cas. Our analysis reveals key characteristics of this system: an orbital period of 5.3329 $\pm$ 0.0002 h, a spin period of 312.7478 $\pm$ 0.0002 s, and a beat period of 317.9267 $\pm$ 0.0002 s. These periods represent a significant refinement over the results of previous studies. These analyses demonstrate that V709 Cas is primarily a disc-overflow accretor, with accretion predominantly occurring via a disc. However, the analysis also reveals epochs where stream-fed accretion is a dominant accretion process. Time-resolved analysis of 20 s short cadence data obtained from sectors 57 and 58 reveals the presence of distinct first harmonics of the spin and beat frequencies. This finding indicates the presence of double peak spin modulation, a characteristic signature of two-pole accretion onto the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Search for binary companions around millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the radio pulsars rotating at spin periods of about 30 millisecond or even lower got such high spins through the transfer of angular momentum by accreting matter from their binary companions (or past companions) in the past. Around 35% of MSPs are known to be isolated, some of the which might actually be in binaries - either not timed very well to obtain the signature of the orbit or in extremely wide binaries that can be revealed only through very accurate timing, as in the case of PSR J1024-0719. This has motivated an exercise to identify probable candidates of companions of MSPs in the Galactic field. This exercise has even the potential of discovering optical emission from MSPs themselves. Discovery of any possible binary companion will be followed by motivated pulsar timing campaigns to confirm the binary nature and to constrain orbital parameters.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT Spectral and Timing Studies of a Giant Outburst in RX J0440.9+4431</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a giant outburst in late 2022 and lasted three months. The Insight-HXMT has observed this source at several instances of the entire outburst in 2022-2023. We used these bright outburst observations of the pulsar to study its X-ray spectral and timing variability. The pulse profiles obtained at similar luminosity during the progress and declining phases of the outburst show a similar shape behavior.With the increase in source luminosity, the complex pulse profile with multiple peaks at low luminosity becomes a single peaked pulse profile at the high luminosity at the outburst peak. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-120 keV are explained with an absorbed cutoff power-law continuum model. During the outburst phases, we have found the evidence of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectra varying in energies ($\sim$ 33.6- 41.6 keV) having broad linewidth &gt; 5 keV . In declining phases of the outburst, we have also found the hints of first cyclotron harmonic varying in 65-75 keV . The application of thermal and bulk Comptonization model to the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra reveals a high surface magnetic field ($B \sim 10^{13}$ G) for the pulsar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicate clouds are known to significantly impact the spectra of late L-type brown dwarfs, with observable absorption features at ~ 10 micron. JWST has reopened our window to the mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity, bringing the characterization of silicates into focus again. Using JWST, we characterize the planetary-mass brown dwarf PSO J318.5338-22.8603, concentrating on any silicate cloud absorption the object may exhibit. PSO J318's spectrum is extremely red, and its flux is variable, both of which are likely hallmarks of cloud absorption. We present JWST NIRSpec PRISM, G395H, and MIRI MRS observations from 1-18 micron. We introduce a method based on PSO J318's brightness temperature to generate a list of cloud species that are likely present in its atmosphere. We then test for their presence with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Using retrievals and grids from various climate models, we derive bulk parameters from PSO J318's spectra, which are mutually compatible. Our retrieval results point to a solar to slightly super-solar atmospheric C/O, a slightly super-solar metallicity, and a 12C/13C below ISM values. The atmospheric gravity proves difficult to constrain for both retrievals and grid models. Retrievals describing the flux of PSO J318 by mixing two 1-D models (``two-column models'') appear favored over single-column models; this is consistent with PSO J318's variability. The JWST spectra also reveal a pronounced absorption feature at 10 micron. This absorption is best reproduced by introducing a high-altitude cloud layer of small (&lt;0.1 micron), amorphous SiO grains. The retrieved particle size and location of the cloud is consistent with SiO condensing as cloud seeding nuclei. High-altitude clouds comprised of small SiO particles have been suggested in previous studies, therefore the SiO nucleation we potentially observe in PSO J318 could be a more wide-spread phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Orbital statistics of multiple systems formed from small-$N$ subclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical $N$-body experiments to explore the statistics of multiple systems formed in small-$N$ subclusters, i.e. the distributions of orbital semi-major axis, $a$, orbital eccentricity, $e$, mass ratio, $q$, mutual orbital inclination, $\theta$, and ejection velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm ej}$. The stars in a subcluster are evolved as if they are the fragmentation products of a single isolated prestellar core from which most of the natal gas has already been dispersed, and there are no correlations between the stars' initial positions and velocities. Two parameters are particularly important: the number of stars in the subcluster, $N$, and the fraction of kinetic energy in ordered rotation, $\alpha_{\rm rot}$. Increasing $N$ has the effect of systematically decreasing the semi-major axes of the tighter orbits, but has very little effect on the semi-major axes of the wider orbits. The main effect of $\alpha_{\rm rot}$ is to regulate the distribution of mutual orbital inclinations, with $\alpha_{\rm rot}\!\sim\!0.5$ producing a distribution of orbital inclinations for triple systems which is consistent with observed values. Triples frequently form in high-inclination orbits without the assistance of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles. Our previous work demonstrated that subclusters with mass segregation, moderate rotation, and typically $N=4$ or 5 stars produced the best fit to the multiplicity statistics (proportions of singles, binaries, triples, etc.). Here we show that these parameters also reproduce the orbital statistics (distributions of orbital semi-major axis, $a$, orbital eccentricity, $e$, mass ratio, $q$, mutual orbital inclination, $\theta$, and ejection velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm ej}$). For the best-fit parameters, $21(\pm 1)\%$ of subclusters produce more than one multiple system.</description>

      <title>White dwarf structure in $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity: beyond the Chandrasekhar mass limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic structure of white dwarfs (WDs) within the framework of modified gravity theory $f(R, T, L_m) = R + \alpha T L_m$, which introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Using a realistic equation of state (EoS) that includes contributions from a relativistic degenerate electron gas and ionic lattice effects, we solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for two standard choices of the matter Lagrangian density: $L_m = p$ and $L_m = -\rho$. We show that the extra $\alpha TL_m$ term significantly alters the mass-radius relation of WDs, especially at high central densities $( \rho_c \gtrsim 10^8 - 10^9\,\rm g/cm^3)$, allowing for stable super-Chandrasekhar configurations. In particular, depending on the sign and magnitude of the parameter $\alpha$, the maximum mass can increase or decrease, and in some regimes, the usual critical point indicating the transition from stability to instability disappears. Our findings suggest that $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework to explain the existence of massive WDs beyond the classical Chandrasekhar limit.</description>

      <title>ARVE: Analyzing Radial Velocity Elements. I. The Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In order to overcome the radial velocity (RV) precision barrier imposed by stellar variability, there has been a surge of software aimed at simulating and modeling these activity patterns. Aims. We present Analyzing Radial Velocity Elements (ARVE), a Python-based software which enables RV extraction using various customizable techniques, and subsequent analysis of the stellar and planetary signals present in the RVs. One of ARVE's unique features is its library of pre-computed auxiliary data, which includes synthetic spectra and spectral line masks, allowing the code to efficiently perform certain routines with minimal input from the user. Methods. ARVE is a class-based and modular code in which its functionalities are divided between four subclasses: functions, which handles general functions utilized by the other subclasses; data, which reads the input data, loads the auxiliary data, and extracts RVs from input high-resolution spectra; star, which characterizes the stellar activity components present in the RV time series; and planets, which performs fits of Keplerian signals in the data and offers injection-recovery tests of fictitious planets to determine the detection limits. Results. Demonstrations of ARVE are performed on three years of HARPS-N solar data. We show the evolution of granulation and supergranulation characteristic timescales with activity level, and we investigate the differences in planetary period-mass detection limits when extracting RVs with different methods. Conclusions. As stellar activity mitigation techniques grow more diverse, we foresee that a tool like ARVE could greatly benefit the community by offering a user-friendly and multi-functional approach to extract and analyze RV time series. With its current code structure, expanded functionality and increased compatibility with more spectrographs should be easily addable to future versions of ARVE.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LXVIII. Characterization of the outer substellar companion around HD 72659 with a multi-technique approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Before discovering the first exoplanets, the Radial Velocity (RV) method had been used for decades to discover binary stars. Despite significant advancements in this technique, it is limited by the intrinsic mass-inclination degeneracy that can be broken when combining RVs with astrometry, which allows us to determine the orbital inclination, or direct imaging, from which we can estimate the true mass of the target. HD 72659 is a solar analog known to host a gas giant on a $\sim 10$-yr orbit and a massive outer companion. This work aims to confirm HD 72659 c, which was recently announced using data from HIRES and HARPS spectrographs in combination with Gaia's astrometric data. We monitored HD 72659 with HARPS-N in the framework of the GAPS project since 2012. We now combined our 91 spectra with literature data and Gaia DR3 high-precision astrometry to constrain the mass and the orbit of this object ($M_{\rm c} \sim 19$ $M_{\rm J}$, $a \sim 21$ au) that falls in the Brown Dwarf desert. Moreover, we analyzed our high-resolution imaging observation taken with SPHERE, but since the target was not detected, we could only derive upper limits on its mass. We characterize the orbital parameters of HD 72659 c, confirming the literature mass of this object but finding a period twice as high as previously reported, and we also refine the parameters of planet b with reduced uncertainties compared to previous works. Finally, we analyze and discuss the dynamic configuration of this system, finding that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism may be at work.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Velocity-Space Signature of Ion Cyclotron Damping Using Liouville Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion cyclotron damping is a key mechanism for the dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy in weakly collisional plasmas. This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfv\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\parallel, v_\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\perp$ dependence on $\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis Study on the Binary Origin of Type Ibn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a class of SN explosions whose progenitors are surrounded by dense helium-rich circumstellar matter (CSM). Some models have been proposed for how to form the dense CSM, with promising scenarios involving either binaries with a low-mass ($\lesssim 3~M_\odot$) helium (He) star, or mergers following common envelope phases between a He star and a compact object. Using rapid binary population synthesis calculations, we estimate the event rate of these channels and compare it with the observed SN Ibn rate. We find that exploding low-mass He stars in close binaries (of separations $\lesssim$ a few 100 $R_\odot$) can be sufficiently produced to account for the observed event rate of SN Ibn, while the merger scenario can likely account for only a fraction of these SNe. We discuss the types of companions expected in the low-mass He star scenario, finding massive main sequence stars ($10$--$20\ M_\odot$) to be typical, with a potentially non-negligible fraction ($&lt;10\%$) of binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions that have long delay times of up to $100$ Myrs.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey VII. First detailed chemical analysis of NGC 6316</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity $[Fe/H]=-0.87\pm0.02$, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were $\sim0.5$ dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around $-0.5$, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around $[Fe/H]=-1$. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a $[\alpha/Fe]=0.31\pm0.02$. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. An isochrone fitting gave us $E(B-V)=0.71$, a higher value than any other from the literature for this cluster since we also estimated $R_V=2.7$, in good agreement with determinations from other works; $(M-m)_0=15.32\pm0.05$. We derive an overall metallicity $[M/H]=-0.6\pm0.05$, in agreement with our abundance determination.</description>

      <title>SN 2023vbg: A Type IIn Supernova Resembling SN 2009ip, with a Long-Duration Precursor and Early-Time Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum, but is commonly characterized by a long-duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor. We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at approximately Mg = -14 mag lasting for about 100 days, followed by a bright bump at Mg = -17 mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases. After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a relatively smooth decline. While the H-alpha profile displays two velocity components (approximately 500 and 3000 km/s), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not seen, though it may emerge later. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution on a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.</description>
