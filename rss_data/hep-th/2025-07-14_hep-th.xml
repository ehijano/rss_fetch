      <title>Kappa Plane Wave Modes and Continuous Squeezing in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of field modes in flat spacetime -- termed $\kappa$-plane wave modes -- constructed from $\kappa$-dependent linear combinations of Minkowski plane waves. These modes define a one-parameter family of vacua, $|0_\kappa\rangle$, that smoothly interpolate between different quantizations, reducing to the Minkowski vacuum in the limit $\kappa \to 0$. We show that $|0_\kappa\rangle$ is uniquely characterized as a continuous-mode squeezed vacuum, with frequency-dependent squeezing parameter $r(\nu)$ satisfying $\tanh r(\nu) = e^{-\pi \nu/\kappa}$. We also derive two Bogoliubov transformations between $\kappa$-plane wave and $\kappa$-Rindler operators, which exhibit a universal form and smoothly interpolate between all known mode decompositions, including those of Minkowski, Rindler, and Unruh quantizations as limiting cases.</description>

      <title>Propagation features of Lorentz-violating electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores some propagation features of electrodynamics in a Lorentz-violating scenario, focusing on a specific CPT-even term within the photon sector of the Standard Model Extension (SME). The study derives a covariant dispersion relation for light propagation in the presence of a Lorentz-violating symmetric tensor field \(C_{ab}(x)\), which reveals a modified light cone structure described by a quartic polynomial. The analysis includes a simplified model where the tensor field assumes a dyadic form, leading to an effective metric that dictates the propagation. The paper investigates three distinct cases: Lorentz-violating vectors which are timelike, lightlike and spacelike, and examines their implications for the effective velocity of light, birefringence, and analogies with electrodynamics in material media. The results highlight anisotropic propagation effects and provide insights into the interplay between Lorentz violation and modified causal structures. The study concludes with a discussion of the phenomenological implications and possible experimental tests for such Lorentz-violating effects.</description>

      <title>Multi-centered Black Hole Quantum Mechanics and Generalized Error Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In type II Calabi-Yau string compactifications, S-duality predicts that suitable generating series of BPS indices counting micro-states of D4-D2-D0 black holes are in general mock modular forms of higher depth. The non-holomorphic contributions needed to cancel the anomaly under modular transformations involve certain indefinite theta series with kernels constructed from generalized error functions. Physically, these contributions are expected to arise from a spectral asymmetry in the continuum of scattering states of $n$ BPS dyons with mutually non-local charges. For $n=2$, the (standard, depth one) error function completion was derived long ago by explicitly computing the bosonic and fermionic density of states in the two-body supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Here we derive the general non-holomorphic completion for an arbitrary number of centers by evaluating the refined Witten index of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics using localisation. In a nutshell, the index reduces to an integral over $\mathbb{R}^{3n-3}$ (the relative location of the centers), and splits into an integral over the $2n-2$ dimensional phase space of BPS ground states times an integral over $n-1$ transverse directions, which ultimately produces the expected generalized error functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and operators in $T\bar{T}$ deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08588v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs are known to possess nonlocal conformal symmetries that do not act tractably on the undeformed local operators. In this paper, we explicitly construct two distinct classes of operators: (i) dressed operators, which are primary operators with respect to the nonlocal conformal symmetries, and (ii) physical operators, a new type of local operator we introduce. While the dressed operators preserve the conformal symmetry structure, they are themselves nonlocal. The physical operators, by contrast, are local and can be expressed in terms of the dressed operators. We calculate the two-point correlation functions of these operators in momentum space and find that our results align with both string theory predictions and field theory calculations. Additionally, we explore the relationship between physical operators and alternative operator definitions proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Higgs branch of 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ symplectic gauge theories and dressed instanton operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand in instanton charge sectors the representation content of the infinite coupling chiral ring of the Higgs branch of 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $Sp(k)$ theories with $N_f$ flavours. The entire chiral ring can be expressed as the product of bare instantons, one for each topological sector, times a common dressing factor depending on the mesons and the instanton-anti instanton bound state. The dressing factor, which is independent of the instanton number, encodes the chiral ring of the theory at finite coupling with one additional colour.</description>

      <title>The thermal backreaction of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature, we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then check how these corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical backreaction and in order to put our result in a context, we compare it to the corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant derived in [1].</description>

      <title>Convergent perturbative series via finite path integral limits: application to energy at strong coupling of the anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving quantum field theories at strong coupling remains a challenging task. The main issue is that the usual perturbative series are asymptotic series which can be useful at weak coupling but break down completely at strong coupling. In this work, we show that if the limits of integration in the path integral are finite, the perturbative series is remarkably an absolutely convergent series which works well at strong coupling. For now, we apply this perturbative approach to $\lambda \,\phi^4$ theory in 0+0 dimensions (a basic integral) and 0+1 dimensions (quantum anharmonic oscillator). For the basic integral, we show that finite integral limits yields a convergent series whose values are in agreement with exact analytical results at any coupling. This worked even when the asymptotic series was not Borel summable. It is well known that the perturbative series expansion in powers of the coupling for the energy of the anhaorminic oscillator yields an asymptotic series and hence fails at strong coupling. In quantum mechanics, if one is interested in the energy, it is often easier to use Schr\"odinger's equation to develop a perturbative series than path integrals. Finite path integral limits are then equivalent to placing infinite walls at positions -L and L in the potential where L is positive, finite and can be arbitrarily large. With walls, the series expansion for the energy is now convergent and approaches the energy of the anharmonic oscillator as the walls are moved further apart. We use the convergent series to calculate the ground state energy at weak, intermediate and strong coupling. At strong coupling, the result from the series agrees with the exact (correct) energy to within 0.1 %, a remarkable result in light of the fact that at strong coupling the usual perturbative series diverges badly right from the start.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctions for 5d BKL dynamics, automorphic L-functions and complex primon gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-singularity BKL dynamics of five dimensional gravity and supergravity (and also an extended four-dimensional supergravity) is known to be given by the billiard problem of a particle within a fundamental domain of the Bianchi groups $PSL(2,{\mathcal O}) \subset PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$, acting on $\mathbb{H}_3$. Here ${\mathcal O}$ are the Gaussian or Eisenstein integers, which define a square or triangular lattice in $\mathbb{C}$. The Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctions near the singularity are, correspondingly, automorphic Maass forms of $PSL(2,{\mathcal O})$. We show how these wavefunctions are associated to certain $L$-functions evaluated along their critical axis. Each of these $L$-functions admits an Euler product representation over the complex primes ${\mathcal{P}}_{\mathcal O} \subset {\mathcal O}$. From this fact we write the $L$-function as the trace over an auxiliary Hilbert space of charged harmonic oscillators, labeled by the complex primes ${\mathcal{P}}_{\mathcal O}$. In this way we have constructed a 'dual' primon gas partition function for the wavefunction of the universe close to a five dimensional cosmological singularity.</description>

      <title>Infra-red enhanced loops in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that logarithmically enhanced infra-red loop corrections arising in theories with four derivatives correspond to a physical running of couplings, rendering quadratic gravity asymptotically free. We find that these effects depend on the gauge and on the field parameterisation. We compute physical on-shell amplitudes and find genuine infra-red log-enhanced loop corrections, that are process-dependent and cannot be absorbed into running couplings. As a byproduct, we derive the effective action of quadratic gravity at tree level, showing that its ghost does not contribute to effective operators and thereby does not violate positivity bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bohmian mechanics has been challenged [Nature 643, 67 (2025)] by studying a system in which the motion of particles cannot be associated only with the gradient of phase of the wave function. We point out that, in general, Bohmian velocity is defined by the continuity equation, which does not always lead to velocity depending only on the phase gradient. By constructing the appropriate velocity explicitly, we overcome the challenge.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Highly accurate simulations of asymmetric black-hole scattering and cross validation of effective-one-body models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal\'{i} reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key finding is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in a (2+1)-D Gauge Theory: The Stringy Nature on a Superconducting Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.</description>

      <title>Chiral and Deconfinement Transitions in Spin-Polarized Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based theory of Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic crystals: Coupling to the spin connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\leq D \leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\"afli symbols $\{p,q\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.</description>

      <title>Penrose process in magnetized non-Kerr rotating spacetime with anomalous quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic Penrose process in the Quevedo-Mashhoon spacetime, immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. This metric is a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solution to Einstein's equations with an arbitrary anomalous quadrupole moment ${\cal Q}$. A non-vanishing ${\cal Q}$ significantly modifies the near-horizon geometry, creating a multi-lobe ergoregion. Both ${\cal Q}$ and $B$ strongly influence the negative-energy region, which can extend well beyond the ergoregion, enabling the magnetic Penrose process to operate far from the ergoregion. Their combined effects allow energy extraction efficiency $\eta$ to far exceed that of the mechanical Penrose process. The maximum efficiency undergoes three distinct evolutionary stages as ${\cal Q}$ varies. In the absence of the magnetic field, efficiency is optimized for more negative ${\cal Q}$ (yielding a more oblate spacetime than Kerr). When electromagnetic interactions dominate, efficiency peaks when the infalling fragment's charge and $B$ share the same sign and ${\cal Q}$ is more positive (producing a more prolate spacetime than Kerr). These findings support the magnetic Penrose process as a theoretical framework for high-energy cosmic phenomena (e.g., extragalactic high-energy radiation) and as a tool to test the Kerr hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics, causal structure, and matter accretion in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole, a static and spherically symmetric solution of vacuum Einstein equations that exhibits a change in metric signature across the event horizon. In this framework, the analysis of radial trajectories of freely falling bodies proves that the central singularity can be avoided via a mechanism we interpret as atemporality, which is responsible for the shift of the time variable from real to imaginary values.
  In this paper, we further explore this model by first examining the behavior of null geodesics. Our investigation requires a set of signature-adaptive coordinate changes that generalize the local Lorentz transformations underlying General Relativity. We find that photon orbits, like their massive counterparts, cannot traverse the event horizon, thereby strengthening the previous result on the impossibility to reach the $r=0$ singularity. Additionally, we discuss the causal structure of the spacetime, provide the corresponding Penrose diagram, and analyze the process of matter accretion in the outer region of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyze within the semiclassical WKB approximation, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show that the $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons partition functions are related to Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. In this abelian context, it turns out that the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction that yields these invariants relies on a ``twisted" category rather than a modular one. Furthermore, the Chern-Simons duality of the $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ partition functions straightforwardly extend to the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.</description>

      <title>Quantum production of gravitational waves after inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of mechanisms in the early Universe lead to the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). We introduce here a novel source of GWs generated by vacuum fluctuations after inflation. Being gravitons minimally coupled particles, their quantum creation takes place during inflation, but is absent in an unperturbed Universe during the radiation-dominated epoch, since they behave as conformally invariant particles. However, the presence of inhomogeneities breaks the conformal flatness of the metric, allowing scalar metric perturbations to induce the quantum production of gravitons. We compute the resulting GW spectrum from this mechanism for different models of the primordial scalar power spectrum. We find that this GW signal peaks around the GHz frequency range, distinguishing it from other astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds and underscoring the need for detectors sensitive to these high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic effective theories for fields with general potentials and their implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Analytic Derivation of the minimal entanglement wedge cross section in the GMMG/GCFT flat holography</title>

Abstract: We focus on a proper candidate for the entanglement wedge in asymptotically flat bulk geometries that are described by the generalized minimal massive gravity (GMMG) in the context of the flat holography. To this end, we describe the boundary by two dimensional Galilean conformal field theory (GCFT) at the bipartite mixed state of the two disjoint intervals. We derive an analytic expression for the minimal entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) in the GMMG/GCFT framework. Our result provides an independent derivation that precisely matches previous computations of holographic entanglement negativity, thereby offering a powerful consistency check and validating both approaches within the GMMG/GCFT framework.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

Abstract: A smoking gun for our current paradigm of the early universe would be direct evidence for the quantum mechanical origin of density perturbations which are conjectured to seed the large scale structure of our universe. A recently-proposed novel phenomenon is that of recoherence, wherein a specific interaction between the adiabatic and the entropic sector leads to the adiabatic mode retaining a coherent state after a transient increase in linear entropy. In this paper, we choose the most general Gaussian action and analyze the evolution of linear entropy, complexity of purification (COP), and complexity of formation (COF) to capture the interplay between decoherence and recoherence in this model. In the presence of two types of couplings that drive these two opposing characteristics, we highlight how COF is an efficient tool for diagnosing dynamics for such an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure of Higher Curvature Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the causal structure of Generalized Quadratic Gravity (GQG) and Einsteinian Cubic Gravity (ECG). It is well known that gravitons in higher-curvature theories can exhibit superluminal propagation, rendering the conventional definition of causal structures based on null curves inadequate. Instead, the causal structure must be defined using the fastest propagating modes, which travel along characteristic surfaces. The superluminal propagation in higher-curvature theories has significant implications for black holes. Specifically, if the Killing horizon of a black hole is not a characteristic surface corresponding to the fastest propagating mode, the horizon can no longer function as a causal barrier. Our analysis demonstrates that GQG with a genuine fourth-order equation of motion possesses only null characteristics, implying that the horizon is a characteristic surface. Furthermore, we perform a detailed characteristic analysis of ECG. We show that while all null surfaces are characteristic surfaces in ECG, the converse is not true - there exist non-null characteristic surfaces. In particular, we identify a non-null characteristic surface in a Type N spacetime in the algebraic classification of spacetimes. Despite the existence of multiple characteristic surfaces in ECG, we establish that the black hole horizon remains a characteristic surface.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear field equations for the supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theory describing totally symmetric bosonic and fermionic massless fields along with hook-type bosonic fields of all spins in any space-time dimension are presented. One of the novel features of the proposed formalism is that the $osp(1,2)$ invariance and factorisation conditions are formulated within the BRST formalism, that greatly simplifies the form of nonlinear HS equations. To match the list of vertices found by Metsaev, higher-spin gauge theory is anticipated to possess an infinite number of independent coupling constants. A conjecture that these coupling constants result from the locality restrictions on the elements of the factorisation ideal is put forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does a nontrivial gravitational excitation require a modified internal gauge theory constitutive law? As there is no canonical mapping between differential forms valued in distinct Lie algebras, the answer is negative, and entirely dependent on the specific unification scheme. A structural formulation in BF theory in terms of a constitutive diagram between the excitations of different interaction sectors is provided, alongside a discussion of the structure of the broken phase. As a nontrivial option, a "spontaneous" breaking into the physical constraint is attempted, however it is shown that basic B-potentials alone would not be viable. A heuristic discussion of internal gauge theory and gravity is provided, and by conflating the observer's internal and external state with the spacetime tangent structure, it is argued that there is a simple geometric obstruction to a nontrivially unified phase. A more ad hoc treatment of gauge theory and gravitational structure remains as the clear path forward, while observer, signal and causal considerations would suggest studying alternative backgrounds to the manifold topology.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a stringy model for $n$-point tree-level form factor with the off-shell operator in the scalar and gluon theories, from the bosonic string disk amplitude: $n$ open string states and $1$ closed string state scatter on the disk. In the field-theory limit ($\alpha'\to0$), the stringy form factor reduces to the form factor, helps us to investigate the hidden properties of the field-theory form factors, manifest the factorization and soft behaviors, and uncover more non-trivial relations between form factors and scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the concept of time-like entanglement entropy (tEE) within the framework of holography. We introduce a robust top-down prescription for computing tEE in higher-dimensional QFTs, both conformal and confining, eliminating the ambiguities typically associated with analytic continuation from Euclidean to Lorentzian signatures. We present accurate analytic approximations for tEE and time-like separations in slab geometries. We establish a clear stability criterion for bulk embeddings and demonstrate that tEE serves as a powerful tool for computing CFT central charges, extending and strengthening previous results. Finally, we apply our framework to holographic confining backgrounds, revealing distinctive behaviours like phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>The Holography of Spread Complexity: A Story of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a holographic description of spread complexity and its rate in 2D CFTs, building on the pioneering work \cite{Caputa:2024sux}. By exploiting the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry, we construct the Krylov basis and demonstrate that its non-uniqueness gives rise to ambiguities analogous to those in quantum complexity. Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, we identify the spread complexity as the energy measured by a bulk observer, with its rate corresponding to the radial momentum. These results suggest a novel holographic interpretation of complexity ambiguity: rather than arising from infinitely many gravitational observables, it may reflect the existence of infinitely many observers, each measuring complexity from their own perspective.</description>

      <title>Spinning the Probe in Kerr with WQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational scattering of a spinning probe mass in a Kerr background using the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) approach. This corresponds to the leading term (0SF) in the gravitational self-force expansion for the spinning two-body problem with large mass hierarchy. By reformulating the geodesic and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations as a recursive Berends-Giele type equation known from multi-gluon scattering, we develop a novel integration-by-parts formalism on the worldline that enables systematic computation of scattering observables - specifically the impulse and spin kick - to arbitrary orders in Newton's constant and spin. Here, the transition to a position space formalism is key. We present explicit results up to and including the physical 7PM order, thereby incorporating all relevant higher-spin and higher-curvature terms on the worldline, advancing beyond previous calculations. This work represents an initial step to reconceptualise the gravitational self-force expansion through worldline quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Effects of perturbation for transition operator of double-${\beta}$ decay on nuclear matrix element, effective axial-vector current coupling, and half-life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nuclear matrix element (NME), effective axial-vector current coupling $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$, and half-life of the double-$\beta$ ($\beta\beta$) decay using the transition operator perturbed by the nuclear interaction. The correction terms for the NME are obtained by extending the hadron sector to a higher order in terms of the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory. The NME calculations are performed for the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and the two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decays of $^{136}$Xe. The nuclear wave functions are calculated by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with the Skyrme, the Coulomb, and the contact pairing interactions. Sufficiently large single-particle valence spaces are used. The correction terms for the NME are comparable with the leading term in absolute value, and the sum of the corrections has the opposite sign to that of the leading term. The $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s for the $\beta\beta$ NME are calculated by a few methods depending on the truncation of the NME and the half-life referred to. Similarities are found between some of these $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s including those of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME. This leads to the conclusion that the value of $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ can indeed be determined by the perturbed transition operator. It is in a comparable range of the $g_A$ for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME. The perturbation effect on the $2\nu\beta\beta$ half-life is discussed by comparing the calculated half-lives with the different $g_A$'s and the NME components.</description>

      <title>Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary value problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a timelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well as for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null hypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise -- one where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where the corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are derived.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals around topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a point scalar charge in circular orbit around a topological star, a regular, horizonless soliton emerging from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. This is the first step towards studying extreme mass-ratio inspirals around these objects. We show that when the particle probes the spacetime close to the object, the scalar-wave flux deviates significantly from the corresponding black hole case. Furthermore, as the topological star approaches the black-hole limit, the inspiral can resonantly excite its long-lived modes, resulting in sharp features in the emitted flux. Although such resonances are too narrow to produce detectable dephasing, we estimate that a year-long inspiral down to the innermost stable circular orbit could accumulate a significant dephasing for most configurations relative to the black hole case. While a full parameter-estimation analysis is needed, the generically large deviations are likely to be within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Unified Field Theory of Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.</description>

      <title>Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis: a $\psi'$SM route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis via leptogenesis in a $\psi'$SM model, which is an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between a few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$: linear dependency between the Cotton-York tensor and the holographic stress tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars.</description>
