      <title>Towards nucleon structure function moments and parton momentum fractions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the lowest even isovector moment of the $F_2$ structure function in $2+1$-flavour lattice QCD with varying quark masses corresponding to $m_\pi \approx [410, 360, 300] \; {\rm MeV}$, at a fixed volume of $V = 48^3 \times 96$ and coupling $\beta = 5.65$ ($a = 0.068(3) \, {\rm fm}$). We directly compute the physical Compton amplitude using the Feynman-Hellmann approach and extract moments of the physical structure function. We report on the quark-mass dependence of the lowest isovector moment and estimate its value at the physical quark-mass point with $\sim 10\%$ uncertainty at fixed $Q^2$. By analysing the $Q^2$ dependence of the moments at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point ($m_\pi \approx 410 \; {\rm MeV}$), we separate the leading- and higher-twist contributions and estimate the parton momentum fraction, $\langle x \rangle_{u-d}$, which agrees with existing results.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six baryon-number-violating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the second part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): the baryon-number-violating sector at dimension six in the power counting. We obtain the results in two different schemes: in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations; and in naive dimensional regularization, which in the considered sector of the theory does not lead to any ill-defined $\gamma_5$-odd traces. Our results are of interest for a reanalysis of the constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model from proton-decay searches within an EFT framework at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering on Quantum Computers via Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework using Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) for simulating real-time scattering processes in $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Unlike traditional lattice discretisation methods, HT approximates the quantum field theory Hilbert space by truncating the energy eigenbasis of a solvable reference Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of required qubits. Our approach involves preparing initial states as wavepackets through adiabatic evolution from the free-field theory to the interacting regime. We experimentally demonstrate this state preparation procedure on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum device and validate it through quantum simulations, capturing key phenomena such as wavepacket dynamics, interference effects, and particle production post-collision. Detailed resource comparisons highlight the advantages of HT over lattice approaches in terms of qubit efficiency, although we observe challenges associated with circuit depth scaling. Our findings suggest that Hamiltonian Truncation offers a promising strategy for quantum simulations of quantum field theories, particularly as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reconstruction of the Critical Line in the QCD Phase Diagram from Imaginary to Real Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test a technique adopted in the lattice simulations framework, to reconstruct the chiral-phase boundary at real chemical potential, $\mu$, via extrapolation from imaginary $\mu$. We use a low-energy effective model, the Quark-Meson model, both in the mean-field approximation and within the Functional Renormalization Group, the latter in the Local Potential Approximation. The model provides results both for real and imaginary values of $\mu$, thus a direct comparison can be performed between the prediction of the model for real values of $\mu$ and the ones obtained via extrapolation from the results at imaginary $\mu$. We compute an effective convergence radius for the reconstruction technique, $\mu_\mathrm{conv}$, and find $\mu_\mathrm{conv}\approx146$ MeV. This value sustains the validity of the reconstruction technique also for finite and moderate values of the chemical potential. On the other hand, within our model, $\mu_\mathrm{conv}$ is quite smaller then the value of $\mu$ where we find the actual critical endpoint. Near this point of the phase diagram, we find a discrepancy between the actual phase boundary and the one pbtained via extrapolatin of $\approx150\%$. Therefore, our results show that the location of the critical endpoint obtained via reconstruction from imaginary $\mu$ should be considered with due caution</description>

      <title>Quantized Axial Charge in the Hamiltonian Approach to Wilson Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of 1+1~D staggered fermions and reconstruct vector and axial charge operators, found by Arkya Chatterjee et al., using the Wilson fermion formalism. These operators commute with the Hamiltonian and become the generators of vector and axial $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetries in the continuum limit. An interesting feature of the axial charge operator is that it acts locally on operators and has quantized eigenvalues in momentum space. Therefore, the eigenstates of this operator can be interpreted as fermion states with a well-defined integer chirality, analogous to those in the continuum theory. This allows us to realize a gauge theory where the axial $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry acts as a gauge symmetry. We construct a Hamiltonian using the eigenstates of the axial charge operator, preserving exact axial symmetry on the lattice and vector symmetry in the continuum. As applications, we examine the implementation of the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) mechanism in the $1^4(-1)^4$ and 3-4-5-0 models. Our formulation supports symmetry-preserving interactions with quantized chiral charges, although further numerical studies are required to verify the SMG mechanism in interacting models.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors of $\Omega^-$ with the meson cloud in the spacelike and timelike regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present comprehensive calculations of the electromagnetic form factors, including the charge, magnetic-dipole, electric-quadrupole and magnetic-octupole form factors, of the $\Omega^-$ in the spacelike region using the quark-diquark approach, incorporating the effect of the meson cloud. The obtained magnetic moment is in agreement with the experimental measurement and the electromagnetic radii are comparable with other model calculations. It is found that the meson cloud effect remains almost unchanged as the energy becomes high and this feature implies that the meson cloud should be considered in all the energy region. Moreover, the asymptotic relations allow us to extend the electromagnetic form factors from the spacelike region to the timelike region, and then the effective form factor is almost identical with the data from CLEO and BESIII. Finally, polarization properties of the final state $\Omega^-$ in the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \Omega^- \bar{\Omega}^+$ process with the unpolarized initial states are also investigated.</description>
