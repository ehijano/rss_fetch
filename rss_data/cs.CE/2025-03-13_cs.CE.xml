      <title>Capturing Lifecycle System Degradation in Digital Twin Model Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate monitoring, control, and other decision-making tasks in real-world engineering systems. Online update methods have been proposed to update DT models. Considering the degradation behavior in the system lifecycle, these methods fail to enable DT models to predict the system responses affected by the system degradation over time. To alleviate this problem, degradation models of measurable parameters have been integrated into DT construction. However, identifying the degradation parameters relies on prior knowledge of the system and expensive experiments. To mitigate those limitations, this paper proposes a lifelong update method for DT models to capture the effects of system degradation on system responses without any prior knowledge and expensive offline experiments on the system. The core idea in the work is to represent the system degradation during the lifecycle as the dynamic changes of DT configurations (i.e., model parameters with a fixed model structure) at all degradation stages. During the lifelong update process, an Autoencoder is adopted to reconstruct the model parameters of all hidden layers simultaneously, so that the latent features taking into account the dependencies among hidden layers are obtained for each degradation stage. The dynamic behavior of latent features among successive degradation stages is then captured by a long short-term memory model, which enables prediction of the latent feature at any unseen stage. Based on the predicted latent features, the model configuration at future degradation stage is reconstructed to determine the new DT model, which predicts the system responses affected by the degradation at the same stage. The test results on two engineering datasets demonstrate that the proposed update method could capture effects of system degradation on system responses during the lifecycle.</description>

      <title>A 3d particle visualization system for temperature management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a 3D visualization technique proposed to analyze and manage energy efficiency from a data center. Data are extracted from sensors located in the IBM Green Data Center in Montpellier France. These sensors measure different information such as hygrometry, pressure and temperature. We want to visualize in real-time the large among of data produced by these sensors. A visualization engine has been designed, based on particles system and a client server paradigm. In order to solve performance problems, a Level Of Detail solution has been developed. These methods are based on the earlier work introduced by J. Clark in 1976. In this paper we introduce a particle method used for this work and subsequently we explain different simplification methods we have applied to improve our solution.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Thermo-Mechanical Simulation of Laser Beam Welding Using High-Performance Computing: A Qualitative Reproduction of Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser beam welding is a non-contact joining technique that has gained significant importance in the course of the increasing degree of automation in industrial manufacturing. This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used.
  The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.</description>

      <title>AI-based Framework for Robust Model-Based Connector Mating in Robotic Wire Harness Installation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of industrial robots in automotive assembly, wire harness installation remains a largely manual process, as it requires precise and flexible manipulation. To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them. Experimental validations on a center console assembly task demonstrate significant improvements in cycle times and robustness compared to conventional robot programming approaches.

      <title>Fourier-enhanced reduced-order surrogate modeling for uncertainty quantification in electric machine design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a data-driven surrogate modeling framework for cost-effectively inferring the torque of a permanent magnet synchronous machine under geometric design variations. The framework is separated into a reduced-order modeling and an inference part. Given a dataset of torque signals, each corresponding to a different set of design parameters, torque dimension is first reduced by post-processing a discrete Fourier transform and keeping a reduced number of frequency components. This allows to take advantage of torque periodicity and preserve physical information contained in the frequency components. Next, a response surface model is computed by means of machine learning regression, which maps the design parameters to the reduced frequency components. The response surface models of choice are polynomial chaos expansions, feedforward neural networks, and Gaussian processes. Torque inference is performed by evaluating the response surface model for new design parameters and then inverting the dimension reduction. Numerical results show that the resulting surrogate models lead to sufficiently accurate torque predictions for previously unseen design configurations. The framework is found to be significantly advantageous compared to approximating the original (not reduced) torque signal directly, as well as slightly advantageous compared to using principal component analysis for dimension reduction. The combination of discrete Fourier transform-based dimension reduction with Gaussian process-based response surfaces yields the best-in-class surrogate model for this use case. The surrogate models replace the original, high-fidelity model in Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification studies, where they provide accurate torque statistics estimates at significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>FOSS solution for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Automation and Collaboration with MDSGAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of setting up and successfully running Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) is outlined to be incredibly labour and computationally expensive with a very high barrier to entry for newcomers wishing to utilise the benefits and insights of MDS. Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file. This solution is designed from the start with a modular mindset allowing for additional software expansion to incorporate numerous extra MDS packages and analysis methods over time</description>

      <title>HELM: Hierarchical Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, with its codon structure directly impacting biological properties. While Language Models (LMs) have shown promise in analyzing biological sequences, existing approaches fail to account for the hierarchical nature of mRNA's codon structure. We introduce Hierarchical Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling (HELM), a novel pre-training strategy that incorporates codon-level hierarchical structure into language model training. HELM modulates the loss function based on codon synonymity, aligning the model's learning process with the biological reality of mRNA sequences. We evaluate HELM on diverse mRNA datasets and tasks, demonstrating that HELM outperforms standard language model pre-training as well as existing foundation model baselines on seven diverse downstream property prediction tasks and an antibody region annotation tasks on average by around 8%. Additionally, HELM enhances the generative capabilities of language model, producing diverse mRNA sequences that better align with the underlying true data distribution compared to non-hierarchical baselines.</description>
