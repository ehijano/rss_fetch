      <title>Spin-glass dynamics: experiment, theory and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of high-quality single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose massive computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental time and length scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to the concept of temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change -- including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory -- are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Coupling Breaks Energy Symmetry in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and ionic liquids to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the electronic and energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct, stable states, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight a compelling method to control charge carrier dynamics via the electrolyte, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized tool for enabling novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws Rooted in the Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks exhibit empirical neural scaling laws, with error decreasing as a power law with increasing model or data size, across a wide variety of architectures, tasks, and datasets. This universality suggests that scaling laws may result from general properties of natural learning tasks. We develop a mathematical model intended to describe natural datasets using percolation theory. Two distinct criticality regimes emerge, each yielding optimal power-law neural scaling laws. These regimes, corresponding to power-law-distributed discrete subtasks and a dominant data manifold, can be associated with previously proposed theories of neural scaling, thereby grounding and unifying prior works. We test the theory by training regression models on toy datasets derived from percolation theory simulations. We suggest directions for quantitatively predicting language model scaling.</description>

      <title>Integrated probabilistic computer using voltage-controlled magnetic tunnel junctions as its entropy source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs) provide a path to solving many computationally hard problems more efficiently than deterministic algorithms on von Neumann computers. Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (S-MTJs), which are engineered to be thermally unstable, show promise as entropy sources in PIMs. However, scaling up S-MTJ-PIMs is challenging, as it requires fine control of a small magnetic energy barrier across large numbers of devices. In addition, non-spintronic components of S-MTJ-PIMs to date have been primarily realized using general-purpose processors or field-programmable gate arrays. Reaching the ultimate performance of spintronic PIMs, however, requires co-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), combining CMOS with spintronic entropy sources. Here we demonstrate an ASIC in 130 nm foundry CMOS, which implements integer factorization as a representative hard optimization problem, using PIM-based invertible logic gates realized with 1143 probabilistic bits. The ASIC uses stochastic bit sequences read from an adjacent voltage-controlled (V-) MTJ chip. The V-MTJs are designed to be thermally stable in the absence of voltage, and generate random bits on-demand in response to 10 ns pulses using the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect. We experimentally demonstrate the chip's functionality and provide projections for designs in advanced nodes, illustrating a path to millions of probabilistic bits on a single CMOS+V-MTJ chip.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties, localization transition and multifractal eigenvectors of the Laplacian on heterogeneous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and eigenvector statistics of the Laplacian on highly-connected networks with random coupling strengths and a gamma distribution of rescaled degrees. The spectral density, the distribution of the local density of states, the singularity spectrum and the multifractal exponents of this model exhibit a rich behaviour as a function of the first two moments of the coupling strengths and the variance of the rescaled degrees. In the case of random coupling strengths, the spectral density diverges within the bulk of the spectrum when degree fluctuations are strong enough. The emergence of this singular behaviour marks a transition from non-ergodic delocalized states to localized eigenvectors that exhibit pronounced multifractal scaling. For constant coupling strengths, the bulk of the spectrum is characterized by a regular spectral density. In this case, the corresponding eigenvectors display localization properties reminiscent of the critical point of the Anderson localization transition on random graphs.</description>

      <title>q-neighbor Ising model on a polarized network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation (Phys. Rev. E 92, 052105) and the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that for each lobby size $q \ge 3$, a specific level of overlap $v^*$ exists, which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach, we show that the dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the absence of temperature, showing consecutive maximum and minimum, that additionally depends on the parity of $q$. The temperature is, in general, a destructive factor; its increase leads to the collapse of polarized clusters for smaller values of $v$ and additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level of polarization. However, we show that this behavior is counter-intuitively inverted for specific lobby sizes and temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical encoding enabled by recurrent linear scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical information processing and computing can potentially offer enhanced performance, scalability and energy efficiency. However, achieving nonlinearity-a critical component of computation-remains challenging in the optical domain. Here we introduce a design that leverages a multiple-scattering cavity to passively induce optical nonlinear random mapping with a continuous-wave laser at a low power. Each scattering event effectively mixes information from different areas of a spatial light modulator, resulting in a highly nonlinear mapping between the input data and output pattern. We demonstrate that our design retains vital information even when the readout dimensionality is reduced, thereby enabling optical data compression. This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric SYK model with a curious low energy behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $\mathcal{N}$ = 2, 4 supersymmetric SYK models that have a peculiar low energy behavior, with the entropy going like $S = S_{0} + \text{(constant)}T^{a}$, where $a \neq 1$. The large $N$ equations for these models are a generalization of equations that have been previously studied as an unjustified truncation of the planar diagrams describing the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics or other related matrix models. Here we reanalyze these equations in order to better understand the low energy physics of these models. We find that the scalar fields develop large expectation values which explore the low energy valleys in the potential. The low energy physics is dominated by quadratic fluctuations around these values. These models were previously conjectured to have a spin glass phase. We did not find any evidence for this phase by using the usual diagnostics, such as searching for replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>
