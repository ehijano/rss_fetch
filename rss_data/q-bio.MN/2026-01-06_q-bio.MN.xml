      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>

      <title>HyperNetWalk: A Unified Framework for Personalized and Population-Level Cancer Driver Gene Identification via Multi-Network Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying cancer driver genes is crucial for understanding tumor biology and developing precision therapies. However, existing computational methods often rely on single biological networks or population-level mutation patterns, limiting their ability to identify patient-specific drivers and leverage the complementary information from multiple network types. Here, we present HyperNetWalk, a novel computational framework that integrates multiple biological networks and hypergraph diffusion to identify driver genes at both personalized and cohort levels. In the first stage, HyperNetWalk integrates protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, and dynamic co-expression networks through sample-independent random walks on patient-specific subnetworks to capture topological importance and expression perturbation effects. In the second stage, it refines predictions through hypergraph-based random walks that leverage cross-sample information while preserving individual mutational contexts. Comprehensive evaluation on 12 TCGA cancer types demonstrates that HyperNetWalk achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both personalized and cohort-level predictions. Notably, HyperNetWalk successfully identifies known driver genes with high precision while revealing cancer type-specific drivers that reflect distinct biological mechanisms. Our framework provides a unified solution for personalized and population-based driver gene identification, offering valuable insights for precision oncology and therapeutic target discovery.</description>
