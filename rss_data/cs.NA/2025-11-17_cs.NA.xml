      <title>Tracking EEG Thalamic and Cortical Focal Brain Activity using Standardized Kalman Filtering with Kinematics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kalman filtering has proven to be effective for estimating brain activity using EEG recordings. In particular, the introduced post hoc standardization step of the algorithm, inspired by the sLORETA time-invariant method, reduces the depth bias and thus allows the estimation to appear at the correct depth from the electrode surface. In the current work, we propose first and second-order kinematic evolution models, where the state-space vector includes not only the dipolar source activity but also its velocity and acceleration. Compared to our previous study, this motion model yields smoother and more physically plausible estimates of brain activity even when the measurement noise is high, for both superficial and deep sources. In addition, we introduce a tunable power parameter that enhances the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Our simulation study, which involves thalamic and cortical activity in the somatosensory region, demonstrates that accurate estimation and tracking of both superficial and deep brain activity are feasible.</description>

      <title>Two Generalized Derivative-free Methods to Solve Large Scale Nonlinear Equations with Convex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose two derivative-free methods to address the problem of large-scale nonlinear equations with convex constraints. These algorithms satisfy the sufficient descent condition. The search directions can be considered generalizations of the Modified Optimal Perry conjugate gradient method and the conjugate gradient projection method or the Spectral Modified Optimal Perry conjugate gradient method and the Spectral Conjugate Gradient Projection method. The global convergence of the former does not depend on the Lipschitz continuity of G. In contrast, the latter's global convergence depends on the Lipschitz continuity of G. The numerical results show the efficiency of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Interior Transmission Eigenvalues: Theory and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interior transmission eigenvalue problem (ITP) plays a central role in inverse scattering theory and in the spectral analysis of inhomogeneous media. Despite its smooth dependence on the refractive index at the PDE level, the corresponding spectral map from material parameters to eigenpairs may exhibit non-smooth or bifurcating behavior. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework identifying sufficient conditions for such non-smooth spectral behavior in the ITP on general domains. We further specialize our analysis to some radially symmetric geometries, enabling a more precise characterization of bifurcations in the spectrum. Computationally, we formulate the ITP as a parametric, discrete, nonlinear eigenproblem and use a match-based adaptive contour eigensolver to accurately and efficiently track eigenvalue trajectories under parameter variation. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and reveal novel non-smooth spectral effects.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of Caputo-type advection-diffusion equations in one and multiple spatial dimensions via shifted Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using a pseudospectral approach, we develop operational matrices based on the shifted Chebyshev polynomials to approximate numerically Caputo fractional derivatives and Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals. In order to make the generation of these matrices stable, we use variable precision arithmetic. Then, we apply the Caputo differentiation matrices to solve numerically Caputo-type advection-diffusion equations in one and multiple spatial dimensions, which involves transforming the discretization of the concerning equation into a Sylvester (tensor) equation. We provide complete Matlab codes, whose implementation is carefully explained. The numerical experiments involving highly oscillatory functions in time confirm the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic models for time-domain scattering by small particles of arbitrary shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate time-dependent wave scattering by multiple small particles of arbitrary shape. To approximate the solution of the associated boundary-value problem, we derive an asymptotic model that is valid in the limit as the particle size tends to zero. Our method relies on a boundary integral formulation, semi-discretized in space using a Galerkin approach with appropriately chosen basis functions, s.t. convergence is achieved as the particle size vanishes rather than by increasing the number of basis functions. Since the computation of the Galerkin matrix involves double integration over particles, the method can become computationally demanding when the number of obstacles is large. To address this, we also derive a simplified model and consider the Born approximation to improve computational efficiency. For the high-order models, we provide an error analysis, supported and validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Extended-Krylov-subspace methods for trust-region and norm-regularization subproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an effective new method for solving trust-region and norm-regularization problems that arise as subproblems in many optimization applications. We show that the solutions to such subproblems lie on a manifold of approximately very low rank as a function of their controlling parameters (trust-region radius or regularization weight). Based on this, we build a basis for this manifold using an efficient extended-Krylov-subspace iteration that involves a single matrix factorization. The problems within the subspace using such a basis may be solved at very low cost using effective high-order root-finding methods. This then provides an alternative to common methods using multiple factorizations or standard Krylov subspaces. We provide numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of our {\tt TREK}/{\tt NREK} approach.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Transfer Learning for Nonlinear PDEs with Perturbative PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining perturbation theory with one-shot transfer learning in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Nonlinear PDEs with polynomial terms are decomposed into a sequence of linear subproblems, which are efficiently solved using a Multi-Head PINN. Once the latent representation of the linear operator is learned, solutions to new PDE instances with varying perturbations, forcing terms, or boundary/initial conditions can be obtained in closed form without retraining.
  We validate the method on KPP-Fisher and wave equations, achieving errors on the order of 1e-3 while adapting to new problem instances in under 0.2 seconds; comparable accuracy to classical solvers but with faster transfer. Sensitivity analyses show predictable error growth with epsilon and polynomial degree, clarifying the method's effective regime.
  Our contributions are: (i) extending one-shot transfer learning from nonlinear ODEs to PDEs, (ii) deriving a closed-form solution for adapting to new PDE instances, and (iii) demonstrating accuracy and efficiency on canonical nonlinear PDEs. We conclude by outlining extensions to derivative-dependent nonlinearities and higher-dimensional PDEs.</description>

      <title>Inverse modeling of porous flow through deep neural networks: the case of coffee percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the inverse problem of espresso coffee extraction, in which one aims to reconstruct the brewing conditions that generate a desired chemical profile in the final beverage. Starting from a high-fidelity multiphysics percolation model, describing fluid flow, solute transport, solid, liquid reactions, and heat exchange within the coffee bed, we derive a reduced forward operator mapping controllable brewing parameters to the concentrations of the main chemical species in the cup. From a mathematical standpoint, we formalize the structural requirements for the local solvability of inverse problems, providing a minimal analytical condition for the existence of a (local) inverse map: continuous differentiability of the forward operator and a locally constant, nondegenerate Jacobian rank. Under these assumptions, the Constant Rank Theorem ensures that the image of the forward operator is a smooth embedded manifold on which well-defined local right-inverses exist.
  Extensive experiments, including off-grid validation, show that the learned inverse map accurately reconstructs brewing temperature, grind size, and powder composition. The resulting framework combines rigorous analytical guarantees with modern data-driven methods, providing a principled and computationally efficient solution to the inverse extraction problem and enabling personalised brewing, recipe optimisation, and integration into smart coffee-machine systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modified Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov--Arnold Network and Multilayer Perceptron Physics-Informed Neural Network to overcome the high-frequency and multiscale challenges inherent in Physics-Informed Neural Networks. This proposed model features a trainable weighting parameter to optimize the convex combination of outputs from the Kolmogorov--Arnold Network and the Multilayer Perceptron, thus maximizing the networks' capabilities to capture different frequency components. Furthermore, we adopt an overlapping domain decomposition technique to decompose complex problems into subproblems, which alleviates the challenge of global optimization. Benchmark results demonstrate that our method reduces training costs and improves computational efficiency compared with manual hyperparameter tuning in solving high-frequency multiscale problems.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Smoothness and Dynamics in an SEIR$^{\text{T}}$R$^{\text{P}}$D Endemic Model with Distributed Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the properties of an SEIR$^{\text{T}}$R$^{\text{P}}$D endemic model expressed through delay-differential equations with distributed delays for latency and temporary immunity. Our research delves into the variability of latent periods and immunity durations across diseases, in particular, we introduce a class of delays defined by continuous integral kernels with compact support. The main result of the paper is a kind of smoothening property which the solution function posesses under mild conditions of the system parameter functions. Also, boundedness and non-negativity is proved. Numerical simulations indicates that the continuous model can be approximated with a discrete lag endemic models. The study contributes to understanding infectious disease dynamics and provides insights into the numerical approximation of exact solution for different delay scenarios.</description>

      <title>L^1 data fitting for Inverse Problems yields optimal rates of convergence in case of discretized white Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known in practice, that L^1 data fitting leads to improved robustness compared to standard L^2 data fitting. However, it is unclear whether resulting algorithms will perform as well in case of regular data without outliers. In this paper, we therefore analyze generalized Tikhonov regularization with L^1 data fidelity for Inverse Problems F(u) = g in a general setting, including general measurement errors and errors in the forward operator. The derived results are then applied to the situation of discretized Gaussian white noise, and we show that the resulting error bounds allow for order-optimal rates of convergence. These findings are also investigated in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A pressure-robust and parameter-free enriched Galerkin method for the Navier-Stokes equations of rotational form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel enriched Galerkin (EG) method for the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in rotational form, which is both pressure-robust and parameter-free. The EG space employed here, originally proposed in [1], differs from traditional EG methods: it enriches the first-order continuous Galerkin (CG) space with piecewise constants along edges in two dimensions or on faces in three dimensions, rather than with elementwise polynomials. Within this framework, the gradient and divergence are modified to incorporate the edge/face enrichment, while the curl remains applied only to the CG component, an inherent feature that makes the space particularly suitable for the rotational form. The proposed EG method achieves pressure robustness through a velocity reconstruction operator. We establish existence, uniqueness under a small-data assumption, and convergence of the method, and confirm its effectiveness by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Spectral Method for Non-Periodic Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds the promise of solving computational mechanics problems in polylogarithmic time, meaning computational time scales as $\mathscr{O}((\log N)^c)$, where $N$ is the problem size and $c$ a constant. We propose a quantum spectral method with polylogarithmic complexity for solving non-periodic boundary value problems with arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our method extends the recently proposed approach by Liu et al. (2025), in which periodic problems are discretised using truncated Fourier series. In such spectral methods, the discretisation of boundary value problems with constant coefficients leads to a set of algebraic equations in the Fourier space. We implement the respective diagonal solution operator by first approximating it with a polynomial and then quantum encoding the polynomial. The mapping between the physical and Fourier spaces is accomplished using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). To impose zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, we double the domain size and reflect all physical fields antisymmetrically. The respective reflection matrix defines the quantum sine transform (QST) by pre- and post-multiplying with the QFT. For non-zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solution is decomposed into a boundary-conforming and a homogeneous part. The homogenous part is determined by solving a problem with a suitably modified forcing vector. We illustrate the basic approach with a Dirichlet-Poisson problem and demonstrate its generality by applying it to a fractional stochastic PDE for modelling spatial random fields. We discuss the circuit implementation of the proposed approach and provide numerical evidence confirming its polylogarithmic complexity.</description>

      <title>Fast Neural Tangent Kernel Alignment, Norm and Effective Rank via Trace Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Higher Order Convergence Rates for Accelerated Wasserstein Gradient Flow Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study higher-order-accurate-in-time minimizing movements schemes for Wasserstein gradient flows. We introduce a novel accelerated second-order scheme, leveraging the differential structure of the Wasserstein space in both Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. For sufficiently smooth energy functionals, we show that our scheme provably achieves an optimal quadratic convergence rate. Under the weaker assumptions of Wasserstein differentiability and $\lambda$-displacement convexity (for any $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$), we show that our scheme still achieves a first-order convergence rate and has strong numerical stability. In particular, we show that the energy is nearly monotone in general, while when the energy is $L$-smooth and $\lambda$-displacement convex (with $\lambda&gt;0$), we prove the energy is non-increasing and the norm of the Wasserstein gradient is exponentially decreasing along the iterates. Taken together, our work provides the first fully rigorous proof of accelerated second-order convergence rates for smooth functionals and shows that the scheme performs no worse than the classical scheme JKO scheme for functionals that are $\lambda$-displacement convex and Wasserstein differentiable.</description>

      <title>MMA-Sim: Bit-Accurate Reference Model of Tensor Cores and Matrix Cores</title>

Abstract: The rapidly growing computation demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) have driven hardware vendors to integrate matrix multiplication accelerators (MMAs), such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores and AMD Matrix Cores, into modern GPUs. However, due to distinct and undocumented arithmetic specifications for floating-point matrix multiplication, some MMAs can lead to numerical imprecision and inconsistency that can compromise the stability and reproducibility of DNN training and inference.
  This paper presents MMA-Sim, the first bit-accurate reference model that reveals the detailed arithmetic behaviors of the MMAs from ten GPU architectures (eight from NVIDIA and two from AMD). By dissecting the MMAs using a combination of targeted and randomized tests, our methodology derives nine arithmetic algorithms to simulate the floating-point matrix multiplication of the MMAs. Large-scale validation confirms bitwise equivalence between MMA-Sim and the real hardware. Using MMA-Sim, we investigate arithmetic behaviors that affect DNN training stability, and identify undocumented behaviors that could lead to significant errors.</description>

      <title>Extending the Numerical Flow Iteration to the multi-species Vlasov-Maxwell system through Hamiltonian Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov--Poisson system. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field, instead of the distribution functions, and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. NuFI has been shown to be more accurate than other state-of-the-art Vlasov solvers given the same amount of degrees of freedom as well as interpolation order, essentially making NuFI a high-fidelity but low-memory cost scheme. In this paper, we build on the Hamiltonian structure of the full Vlasov--Maxwell system to extend NuFI to handle electro-magnetic kinetic plasma dynamics. We show that the advanced structure-preserving properties of NuFI are preserved when extending to the electro-magnetic case.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Lie Group Symmetries to Enhance Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Fundamental Solution of Linear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the introduction of deep learning for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), there has been growing interest in real-time system responses, where the kernel function plays a key role. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a popular mesh-free, semi-supervised learning tool, offer high flexibility. This paper explores the integration of Lie symmetry groups with deep learning techniques to enhance the numerical solutions of fundamental PDEs. We propose a novel approach that combines PINNs and Lie group theory to address computational inefficiencies in traditional methods. By incorporating the linearized symmetric condition (LSC) derived from Lie symmetries into PINNs, we introduce a new residual loss function that requires fewer derivatives for calculation. This integration reduces computational costs and improves solution accuracy. Numerical simulations demonstrate a significant reduction in training time while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, we provide a framework for identifying invariant infinitesimal generators for arbitrary Cauchy problems. This unsupervised algorithm does not require prior numerical solutions, making it practical and efficient for various applications.</description>

      <title>An exponential map free implicit midpoint method for stochastic Lie-Poisson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integrator for a class of stochastic Lie-Poisson systems driven by Stratonovich noise is developed. The integrator is suited for Lie-Poisson systems that also admit an isospectral formulation, which enables scalability to high-dimensional systems. Its derivation follows from discrete Lie-Poisson reduction of the symplectic midpoint scheme for stochastic Hamiltonian systems. We prove almost sure preservation of Casimir functions and coadjoint orbits under the numerical flow and provide strong and weak convergence rates of the proposed method. The scalability, structure-conservation, and convergence rates are illustrated numerically for the (generalized) rigid body, point vortex dynamics, and the two-dimensional Euler equations on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Subspace method of moments for ab initio 3-D single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06889v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a widely used technique for recovering the 3-D structure of biological molecules from a large number of experimentally generated noisy 2-D tomographic projection images of the 3-D structure, taken from unknown viewing angles. Through computationally intensive algorithms, these observed images are processed to reconstruct the 3-D structures. Many popular computational methods rely on estimating the unknown angles as part of the reconstruction process, which becomes particularly challenging at low signal-to-noise ratios. The method of moments (MoM) offers an alternative approach that circumvents the estimation of viewing orientations of individual projection images by instead estimating the underlying distribution of the viewing angles, and is robust to noise given sufficiently many images. However, the method of moments typically entails computing higher-order moments of the projection images, incurring significant computational and memory costs. To mitigate this, we propose a new approach called the subspace method of moments (SubspaceMoM), which compresses the first three moments using data-driven low-rank tensor techniques as well as expansion into a suitable function basis. The compressed moments can be efficiently computed from the set of projection images using numerical quadrature and can be employed to jointly reconstruct the 3-D structure and the distribution of viewing orientations. We illustrate the practical applicability of SubspaceMoM through numerical experiments using up to the third-order moment on synthetic datasets with a simplified cryo-EM image formation model, which significantly improves the reconstruction resolution compared to previous MoM approaches.</description>

      <title>Hardware Acceleration for HPS Algorithms in Two and Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a flexible, open-source framework for hardware acceleration, namely massively-parallel execution on general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), applied to the hierarchical Poincar\'e--Steklov (HPS) family of algorithms for building fast direct solvers for linear elliptic partial differential equations. To take full advantage of the power of hardware acceleration, we propose two variants of HPS algorithms to improve performance on two- and three-dimensional problems. In the two-dimensional setting, we introduce a novel recomputation strategy that minimizes costly data transfers to and from the GPU; in three dimensions, we modify and extend the adaptive discretization technique of Geldermans and Gillman [2019] to greatly reduce peak memory usage. We provide an open-source implementation of these methods written in JAX, a high-level accelerated linear algebra package, which allows for the first integration of a high-order fast direct solver with automatic differentiation tools. We conclude with extensive numerical examples showing our methods are fast and accurate on two- and three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations for the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation which models solar and stellar oscillations. We introduce and analyze hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations (HDG) that are stable and optimally convergent for all polynomial degrees greater than or equal to one. The proposed methods are robust with respect to the drastic changes in the magnitude of the coefficients that naturally occur in stars. Our analysis is based on the concept of discrete approximation schemes and weak T-compatibility, which exploits the weakly T-coercive structure of the equation. Compared to the $H^1$-conforming discretization of [Halla, Lehrenfeld, Stocker, 2022], our method offers improved stability and robustness. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the computational costs compared to the $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming DG discretization of [Halla, 2023], which has similar stability properties. These advantages make the proposed HDG methods well-suited for astrophysical simulations.</description>

      <title>Augmented data and neural networks for robust epidemic forecasting: application to COVID-19 in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data augmentation strategy aimed at improving the training phase of neural networks and, consequently, the accuracy of their predictions. Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty. The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system, making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region (Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates for Interior Penalty D.G. Methods for the Nonlinear Dynamics of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex Landau equation, a reaction diffusion system with applications in nonlinear optics and fluid dynamics. The equation's nonlinear imaginary component introduces rich dynamics and significant computational challenges. We address these challenges using Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. A rigorous stability analysis and a comparative study are performed on three distinct DG schemes : Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG), Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG), and Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG). These methods are compared in terms of their stability and computational efficiency. Our numerical analysis and computational results demonstrate that all three discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are stable. However, the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme proves to be the most robust, as its norm remains bounded even in the presence of nonlinear terms a property not shared by the others. A comparison between the Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG) and Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG) schemes shows that IIPG has superior stability properties. For high values of the penalty parameter, all methods exhibit similar stability behavior. Our results highlight the suitability of DG methods for simulating complex nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems and provide a practical framework for selecting the most efficient scheme for a given problem.</description>
