      <title>Spatio-temporal Joint Analysis of PM2.5 and Ozone in California with INLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial threat of concurrent air pollutants to public health is increasingly severe under climate change. To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision-transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 230 to 707 PFLOPS, with scaling efficiency maintained at 78% to 96% across 24,576 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the region of possible sprite inception in the mesosphere above winter thunderstorms under wind shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient luminous events (TLEs) is the collective name given to mesospheric electrical breakdown phenomena occurring in conjunction with strong lightning discharges in tropospheric thunderstorms. They include elves, sprites, haloes and jets, and are characterized by short lived optical emissions, mostly of red (665 nm) and blue (337 nm) wavelengths. Sprites are caused by the brief quasi-electrostatic field induced in the mesosphere, mostly after the removal of the upper positive charge of the thundercloud by a +CG, and they have been recorded above most of the lightning activity centers on Earth. In wintertime, there are just a few areas where lightning occurs, and of those, sprites have been observed over the Sea of Japan, the British Channel, and the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike their summer counterparts, winter thunderstorms tend to have weaker updrafts and as a result, reduced vertical dimensions and compact charge structures, whose positive and negative centers are located at lower altitudes. These storms are often susceptible to significant wind shear and as a result may exhibit a tilted dipole charge structure and a lateral offset of the upper positive charge relative to the main negative charge. We present results of numerical simulations using a three-dimensional explicit formulation of the mesospheric electrostatic electrical field following a lightning discharge from a typical mid-latitude winter thunderstorm exhibiting tilt due to wind shear and evaluate the regions of possible sprite inception. Our results show, as numerous observations suggest, that sprites can be shifted a large distance from the location of the parent +CG in the direction of the shear and will occur over a larger region compared with non-sheared storms.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusion models for downscaling &amp; bias correction of Earth system model precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and flooding. As these events cause severe losses of property and lives, accurate high-resolution simulation of precipitation is imperative. However, existing Earth System Models (ESMs) struggle with resolving small-scale dynamics and suffer from biases, especially for extreme events. Traditional statistical bias correction and downscaling methods fall short in improving spatial structure, while recent deep learning methods lack controllability over the output and suffer from unstable training. Here, we propose a novel machine learning framework for simultaneous bias correction and downscaling. We train a generative diffusion model in a supervised way purely on observational data. We map observational and ESM data to a shared embedding space, where both are unbiased towards each other and train a conditional diffusion model to reverse the mapping. Our method can be used to correct any ESM field, as the training is independent of the ESM. Our approach ensures statistical fidelity, preserves large-scale spatial patterns and outperforms existing methods especially regarding extreme events and small-scale spatial features that are crucial for impact assessments.</description>

      <title>Pixels and Predictions: Potential of GPT-4V in Meteorological Imagery Analysis and Forecast Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI, such as OpenAI's GPT-4V large-language model, has rapidly entered mainstream discourse. Novel capabilities in image processing and natural-language communication may augment existing forecasting methods. Large language models further display potential to better communicate weather hazards in a style honed for diverse communities and different languages. This study evaluates GPT-4V's ability to interpret meteorological charts and communicate weather hazards appropriately to the user, despite challenges of hallucinations, where generative AI delivers coherent, confident, but incorrect responses. We assess GPT-4V's competence via its web interface ChatGPT in two tasks: (1) generating a severe-weather outlook from weather-chart analysis and conducting self-evaluation, revealing an outlook that corresponds well with a Storm Prediction Center human-issued forecast; and (2) producing hazard summaries in Spanish and English from weather charts. Responses in Spanish, however, resemble direct (not idiomatic) translations from English to Spanish, yielding poorly translated summaries that lose critical idiomatic precision required for optimal communication. Our findings advocate for cautious integration of tools like GPT-4V in meteorology, underscoring the necessity of human oversight and development of trustworthy, explainable AI.</description>

      <title>Wave-resolving Voronoi model of Rouse number for sediment entrainment equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Transitions in Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence features an inverse energy cascade that produces large-scale flow structures such as large-scale vortices (LSVs) and unidirectional jets. We investigate the dynamics of such structures using extensive direct numerical simulations (DNS) of randomly forced, viscously damped 2D turbulence within a periodic rectangular (Cartesian) domain $[0,L_x]\times[0,L_y]$. LSVs form and dominate the system when the domain aspect ratio $\delta = L_x/L_y \approx 1$, while unidirectional jets predominate at $\delta \gtrsim 1.1$. At intermediate $\delta$, both structures are metastable, with noise-induced transitions between LSVs and jets. We derive and verify predictions for the dependence of kinetic energy E and flow polarity on the nondimensional control parameters. We further collect detailed statistics on the lifetimes of LSVs and jets from DNS runs that are up to 10738 viscous diffusive times long. The distribution of the lifetimes is consistent with that of a memoryless process. Our DNS show an exponential dependence of the mean lifetime on $\delta$. Mean lifetimes depend sensitively on the Reynolds number Re: as Re increases, the energy gap between LSV (lower E) and jet states (higher E) arising from anisotropic dissipation increases, leading to an approximately exponential increase in lifetimes with Re for both LSVs and jets. Similarly, as the forcing scale decreases, transitions become less frequent. We study the transitions in detail, revealing that they occur in two stages: an initial, rapid redistribution of kinetic energy by nonlinear triadic interactions deforms LSVs into jets or vice versa. In the second stage, the energy of the newly formed structure slowly adjusts to its associated equilibrium value on a longer, viscous timescale, producing hysteresis. Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of coherent large-scale structures in anisotropic turbulence.</description>
