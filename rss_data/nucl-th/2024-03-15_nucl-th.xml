      <title>Effects of neck and nuclear orientations on the mass drift in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarified that the fusion hindrance in heavy ion collisions is caused by the expansion of the neck bridge at the early stage of collision [Phys. Rev. C 108, 014612 (2023)]; however, our discussion was limited to the trajectory analysis. To get a reliable fusion cross section, it is important to understand the fusion process connecting with multinucleon transfer and also the process depending on the target orientation in detail. Especially, the effects of target orientation on the multinucleon transfer process have not been discussed so far in our model. First, we investigate precisely the start time of the neck expansion relevant to the mass transfer. The main aims of this paper are to discuss the mass drift in the collision with the different target orientations within the dynamical approach in the reaction 32S + 232Th. The orientation effects are incorporated within the framework of the Langevin equation. The start time of the neck expansion was presumed to be 10 zs by analysis in several entrance channels. By taking account of the target nuclear orientation, a strong mass-angle correlation was obtained which is compatible with the experimental data. Not only ``delayed relaxation'' of the neck but also the nuclear orientation effects have an important role in the strong correlation between fragment mass and its emitting angle. The mass evolution toward mass symmetry is slower than the standard mass drift mode assuming an exponential-type function. Particularly, the mass drift of the tip collision follows the slow mass drift mode assuming a Fermi-type function rather than an exponential-type function, which is related to the different features of the maximum neck cross-sectional area in the sticking process.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $\Lambda\alpha$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the $\Lambda$-${}^4\mathrm{He}$ ($\alpha$) momentum correlation in high-energy collisions to elucidate the interaction between Lambdas ($\Lambda$) and nucleons ($N$). We compare phenomenological $\Lambda\alpha$ potentials with different strength at short range. In addition to the conventional Gaussian type potentials, we construct the $\Lambda\alpha$ potentials by substituting the nucleon density distribution of $\alpha$ in the Skyrme-type $\Lambda$ potentials. We find that the dependence on the employed potential models is visible in the correlation functions from a small size source. This indicates that the $\Lambda\alpha$ momentum correlation could constrain the property of the $\Lambda N$ interaction at high densities, which is expected to play an essential role in dense nuclear matter. Also, we verify that the Lednicky-Lyuboshits formula can yield erroneous results for a small source size with a potential which has large interaction range, like the $\Lambda\alpha$ system.</description>

      <title>Detecting the third family of compact stars with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the anomaly detection framework based on Normalizing Flows (NF) models introduced in \cite{PhysRevC.106.065802} to detect the presence of a large (destabilising) dense matter phase transition in neutron star (NS) observations of masses and radii, and relate the feasibility of detection with parameters of the underlying mass-radius sequence, which is a functional of the dense matter equation of state. Once trained on simulated data featuring continuous $M(R)$ solutions (i.e., no phase transitions), NF is used to determine the likelihood of a first-order phase transition in a given set of $M(R)$ observations featuring a discontinuity, i.e., perform the anomaly detection. Different mock test sets, featuring two branch solutions in the $M(R)$ diagram, were parameterized by the NS mass at which the phase transition occurs, $M_c$, and the radius difference between the heaviest hadronic star and lightest hybrid star, $\Delta R$. We analyze the impact of these parameters on the NF performance in detecting the presence of a first-order phase transition. Among the results, we report that given a set of 15 stars with radius uncertainty of $0.2$ km, a detection of a two-branch solution is possible with 95\% accuracy if $\Delta R &gt; 0.4$ km.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of the sign of gluon polarization in the proton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the possible existence of negative gluon helicity, $\Delta g$, has been observed to be compatible with existing empirical constraints, including from jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC, and lattice QCD data on polarized gluon Ioffe time distributions. We perform a new global analysis of polarized parton distributions in the proton with new constraints from the high-$x$ region of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). A dramatic reduction in the quality of the fit for the negative $\Delta g$ replicas compared to those with positive $\Delta g$ suggest that the negative $\Delta g$ solution cannot simultaneously account for high-$x$ polarized DIS data along with lattice and polarized jet data.</description>

      <title>Collapsar disk outflows I: Viscous hydrodynamic evolution in axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate mass ejection from accretion disks formed during the collapse of rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. The neutrino-cooled, black hole (BH) accretion disk system that forms at the center of the star -- and the ensuing outflows -- provide the conditions for these systems to be candidate $r$-process element production sites and potential progenitors of broad-lined Type Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae. Here we present global, long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of collapsar disks that include angular momentum transport through shear viscosity, neutrino emission and absorption, a 19-isotope nuclear reaction network and nuclear statistical equilibrium solver, a pseudo-Newtonian BH with mass and spin modified by accreted matter, and self-gravity. Starting from a stellar profile collapsed in spherical symmetry, our models capture disk formation self-consistently, and are evolved until after the shock wave -- driven by disk winds -- reaches the surface of the star. None of our models achieve sufficient neutronization to eject significant amounts of $r$-process elements (detailed nucleosynthesis calculations will follow in a companion paper). Sufficient $^{56}$Ni is produced to power a typical type Ic-BL supernova light curve, but the average asymptotic velocity is a factor $\sim 2-3$ times too slow to account for the typical line widths in type Ic-BL supernova spectra. The gap in neutrino emission between BH formation and shocked disk formation, and the magnitude of the subsequent peak in emission, would be observable diagnostics of the internal conditions of the progenitor in a galactic collapsar. Periodic oscillations of the shocked disk prior to its expansion are also a potential observable through their impact on the the neutrino and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al.~[1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.03 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.07$. However, as first noted in~[1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>Curvature of the chiral phase transition line from the magnetic equation of state of (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dependence of the chiral phase transition temperature on baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials by calculating the leading order curvature coefficients in the light and strange quark flavor basis as well as in the conserved charge ($B, S$) basis. Making use of scaling properties of the magnetic equation of state (MEoS) and including diagonal as well as off-diagonal contributions in the expansion of the energy-like scaling variable that enters the parametrization of the MEoS, allows to explore the variation of $T_c(\mu_B,\mu_S) = T_c ( 1 - (\kappa_2^B \hat{\mu}_B^2 + \kappa_2^S \hat{\mu}_S^2 + 2\kappa_{11}^{BS} \hat{\mu}_B \hat{\mu}_S))$ along different lines in the $(\mu_B,\mu_S)$ plane. On lattices with fixed cut-off in units of temperature, $aT=1/8$, we find $\kappa_2^B=0.015(1)$, $\kappa_2^S=0.0124(5)$ and $\kappa_{11}^{BS}=-0.0050(7)$. We show that the chemical potential dependence along the line of vanishing strangeness chemical potential is about 10\% larger than along the strangeness neutral line. The latter differs only by about $3\%$ from the curvature on a line of vanishing strange quark chemical potential, $\mu_s=0$. We also show that close to the chiral limit the strange quark mass contributes like an energy-like variable in scaling relations for pseudo-critical temperatures. The chiral phase transition temperature decreases with decreasing strange quark mass, $T_c(m_s)= T_c(m_s^{\rm phy}) (1 - 0.097(2) (m_s-m_s^{\rm phys})/m_s^{\rm phy}+{\cal O}((\Delta m_s)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from glitch-induced f-mode oscillations in quark and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter in compact stars is dense enough that transient events within the star could have sufficiently high energies to produce detectable gravitational waves (GWs). These GWs could be used to constrain the equation of state (EoS) for matter in the star and could reveal that there is more than one type of EoS at play in the population, implying that multiple types of compact stars exist. One of these types could be quark stars, composed almost entirely of stable quark matter, and observing GWs is a way to test for the strange matter EoS. Here we explore the possibility that, if fundamental (f-) mode oscillations in pulsars are induced by a pulsar glitch, then these oscillations might produce detectable GWs. We use the existing population of pulsars and their glitches, as well as a much larger synthesized population, along with 15 EoSs (8 for neutron stars and 7 for quark stars) to generate frequencies, damping times, and GW strengths for each. We find that of the EoSs examined, all quark star EoSs produce narrower distributions of f-mode frequency than neutron star EoSs. This result, along with other elements of the data, could be used to differentiate between GWs (or other signals from f-modes) originating from neutron stars and quark stars and thus could confirm the existence of quark stars. We also find that GW astronomy is a potentially viable method for detecting a larger population of pulsars which are not observable electromagnetically and that future GW observatories have the possibility to greatly expand this capability.</description>

      <title>Comparing pion production in transport simulations of heavy-ion collisions at $270A$ MeV under controlled conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the TMEP, we present a detailed study of the performance of different transport models in Sn+Sn collisions at $270A$ MeV, and put particular emphasis on the production of pions and $\Delta$ resonances, which have been used as probes of the nuclear symmetry energy. We prescribe a common and rather simple physics model, and follow in detail the results of 4 BUU models and 6 QMD models. The nucleonic evolution of the collision and the nucleonic observables in these codes do not completely converge, but the differences among the codes can be understood as being due to several reasons: the basic differences between BUU and QMD models in the representation of the phase-space distributions, computational differences in the mean-field evaluation, and differences in the adopted strategies for the Pauli blocking in the collision integrals. For pionic observables, we find that a higher maximum density leads to an enhanced pion yield and a reduced $\pi^-/\pi^+$ yield ratio, while a more effective Pauli blocking generally leads to a slightly suppressed pion yield and an enhanced $\pi^-/\pi^+$ yield ratio. We specifically investigate the effect of the Coulomb force, and find that it increases the total $\pi^-/\pi^+$ yield ratio but reduces the ratio at high pion energies, although differences in its implementations do not have a dominating role in the differences among the codes. Taking into account only the results of codes that strictly follow the homework specifications, we find a convergence of the codes in the final charged pion yield ratio to a $1\sigma$ deviation of about $5\%$. However, the uncertainty is expected to be reduced to about $1.6\%$ if the same or similar strategies and ingredients, i.e., an improved Pauli blocking and calculation of the non-linear term in the mean-field potential, are similarly used in all codes.</description>

      <title>Multimodality of $^{187}$Ir fission studied by Langevin approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Background] The fission mechanism of sub-lead nuclides remains unclear, especially the types of fission modes involved and their corresponding shell effects. [Purpose] The aim is to identify the different modes in the fission of $^{187}$Ir, and investigate the corresponding mechanism. [Method] The three-dimensional Langevin approach considering nucleus elongation, deformation, and mass asymmetry is applied to simulate fission dynamics. The macro-microscopic models are used to calculate the transport coefficients. [Results] The fragment mass, deformation, and total kinetic energy (TKE) of $^{187}$Ir fission at different excitation energies are calculated. Based on the mass-TKE correlations, four fission modes are identified, namely two asymmetric standard modes, a symmetric super-long mode, and a symmetric liquid-drop mode. Strong excitation-energy resistance of two asymmetric modes is found. The mass distributions show the dominance of single-peak shape, which is in good agreement with experimental data. The fission potential energy surface and the fission dynamics are analyzed to investigate the origins of the modes and the competition between neutron and proton shell effects. [Conclusions] Multiple fission modes are included in the $^{187}$Ir fission behind the single-peak-like distribution of observables. The proton and neutron magic numbers with different asymmetry parameter might heighten the sensitivity to the uncertainties of shell corrections.</description>

Abstract: The magnitude of fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC exceeds conventional explanation. Here it is shown that if the scalar condensate, which is typically associated with chiral symmetry, is accompanied by an isospin=1 field, then the combination can produce large fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons.</description>

Abstract: This study utilizes the double copy relation to derive on-shell gravity as product of gauge fields in Anti-de Sitter(AdS)space. Comparing with its corresponding conformal field theory (CFT) gauge field, we establish a unique connection between CFT gauge field and another gauge field in on-shell AdS space, and confirmed it as a strong-weak correspondence having associated thermodynamic properties. Also, it provides gravity theory coupling to a tensor field instead of a scalar field, to be more complex but perhaps more accurate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>
