      <title>Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and approaches to optimize Z sensitivity. Specifically, we show that ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column considered. A monotonic $Z$-dependence is found when the reconstructed projected atomic potentials are integrated over a small region. When increasing the integration area, $Z$-contrast changes significantly, becoming highly non-monotonic and following trends in the orbital shell-structure. Moreover, the reconstructed projected potential aligns with the transmission function with an overall deviation of only 2.4\%. The non-monotonic $Z$-dependence is further shown to be useful to accentuate contrast between certain elements, allowing for distinguishability of elements that are only a single atomic number apart, and even in $&gt;$ 20 nm thick samples. This is demonstrated for $\beta$-CuZn ($Z$ = 29 and 30), with the differentiability between the elements explored for different signal quantification methods. The impact of electron dose and finite effective source size are also considered. These results demonstrate that the atom column integration area can optimize ptychographic $Z$-contrast for specific applications and experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Pulse Efficiency Constraints in Atom Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are designed around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i) Resonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer techniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii) very-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two interferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of expectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse - highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse fidelities.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of subabsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict and experimentally demonstrate a new type of collective (cooperative) coupling effect where a disordered atomic ensemble absorbs light with a rise-time longer (i. e., at a rate slower) than what is dictated by single-atom physics. This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as the absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a dilute ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms with a low optical depth, and time-resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant laser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on establishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction is not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly susceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 $\mu$K is enough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a theoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The model uses density-dependent dephasing rate of the long-range dipole-dipole correlations as a single adjustable parameter. Experiment-theory comparison indicates a dephasing coefficient of $\beta/2 \pi = 4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ Hz~cm$^3$, which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the known dipole-dipole line broadening coefficient in $^{87}$Rb.</description>

      <title>Repeated ancilla reuse for logical computation on a neutral atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical tweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number scaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom movement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the lifetime of an atom in the system.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological rate formulas for over-barrier ionization of hydrogen and helium atoms in strong constant electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic over-barrier ionization (OBI) of atoms in strong electric fields is studied, focussing on hydrogen and helium as concrete examples. Our goal is, on the one hand, to develop an intuitive physical picture behind established empirical formulas for the ionization rate. We show that the ionization rate in a near OBI regime can be modelled quantitatively by extending corresponding tunneling rates by the combined action of the Stark effect and a widened electron emission angle. On the other hand, we present analytical rate formulas in a far OBI regime which closely agree with available numerical data. In result, compact rate expressions describing OBI of hydrogen-like and helium atoms in a broad range of applied field strengths are obtained. They can be useful, for example, in numerical laser-plasma simulation codes to describe elementary ionization events.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a Poincar\'e beam with optically polarized atoms in the presence of constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the frequent applications of structured light modes in optically pumped atomic magnetometers. In this work, we theoretically explore how a Poincar\'e beam probes an optically polarized atomic medium. Specifically, we consider atoms polarized by a plane wave with linear polarization, immersed in a constant external magnetic field. We analyze how the polarization of the pump and probe light fields, along with the external magnetic field, impact the absorption profile. To this end, we employ a density matrix approach based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation. Our results reveal that the absorption profile exhibits an asymmetric pattern that depends on the magnetic field strength and the mutual orientation of the pump and probe light propagation directions relative to the quantization axis. For illustration, we assume the incoming radiation drives an electric dipole transition, $5s \, ^2S_{1/2}$ ($F=1$) $\rightarrow$ $5p \, ^2P_{3/2}$ ($F=0$), in rubidium atoms subjected to a magnetic field. These findings may aid in designing future experiments on optically pumped atomic magnetometers utilizing structured light modes.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Ground-State Transfer of Ultracold Bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of ultracold samples of $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules in their rovibrational ground state. By investigating potentially suitable excited states using one- and two-photon spectroscopy, we have identified a pathway to the ground state via an exceptionally narrow intermediate state. Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), we create trapped samples of up to 3500 molecules at temperatures of 1 $\mu$K with one-way efficiencies of 71%. The lifetime of these samples is limited by a near-universal two-body loss process, which could shed new light on similar loss mechanisms in other molecular species. Our results are a step towards establishing an alternative platform for the study of bosonic and fermionic quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&amp;F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&amp;F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions.
  We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&amp;F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&amp;D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>
