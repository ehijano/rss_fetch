      <title>Stability and dynamics of the laminar flow past rectangular prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laminar flow past rectangular prisms is studied in the space of length-to-height ratio ($1 \le L/H \le 5$), width-to-height ratio ($1.2 \le W/H \le 5$) and Reynolds number ($Re \lessapprox 700$). The primary bifurcation is investigated with linear stability analysis. For large $W/L$ it consists of an oscillating mode breaking the top/bottom planar symmetry. For smaller $W/L$ the flow becomes first unstable to stationary perturbations, and the wake experiences a static deflection, vertical for intermediate $W/L$ and horizontal for small $W/L$. Weakly nonlinear analysis and nonlinear direct numerical simulations are used for $L/H = 5$ and larger $Re$. For $W/H = 1.2$ and $2.25$, after the primary bifurcation the flow recovers the top/bottom planar symmetry but loses the left/right one, via supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations, respectively. Further increasing $Re$, the flow becomes unsteady and oscillates around either the deflected (small $W/H$) or the non-deflected (intermediate $W/H$) wake. For intermediate $W/H$ and $R$e, a periodic and fully symmetric regime is detected, with hairpin vortices shed from the top and bottom leading-edge (LE) shear layers; its triggering mechanism is discussed. At large $Re$ and for all $W/H$, the flow approaches a chaotic state characterised by the superposition of different modes: shedding of hairpin vortices from the LE shear layers, and wake flapping in the horizontal and vertical directions. In some portions of the parameter space the different modes synchronise, giving rise to periodic regimes also at relatively large $Re$.</description>

      <title>A progressive data-augmented RANS model for enhanced wind-farm simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of advanced simulation tools is essential, both presently and in the future, for improving wind-energy design strategies, paving the way for a complete transition to sustainable solutions. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are pivotal in enhancing our comprehension of the complex flow within and around wind farms and, hence, improving their capacity to accurately model turbulence within this context is a vital research goal. The enhancement is essential for a precise prediction of wake recovery and for capturing intricate flow phenomena such as secondary flows of Prandtl's second kind behind the turbines. To reach these objectives, here, we propose a progressive data-augmentation approach. We first incorporate the turbine-induced forces in the turbulent kinetic energy equation of the widely used $k-\omega\text{SST}$ model. Afterward, we utilize data from large-eddy simulations to progressively enhance the Reynolds-stress prediction of this baseline model, accurately capturing the evolution of eddy viscosity in the wake, as well as the emergence of secondary flows. We then apply the optimized model to two unseen cases with distinct layouts and conduct a comparative analysis focusing on the obtained quantities such as normalized streamwise velocity deficit, turbulence intensity, and power output. We also examine the success rate of the augmented model in predicting the secondary flows in the wake region. Our comparisons and validations demonstrate the superior performance of the progressive data-augmented model over the standard version in all cases considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Trapping and extreme clustering of finitely-dense inertial particles near a rotating vortex pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small heavy particles cannot get attracted into a region of closed streamlines in a non-accelerating frame (Sapsis &amp; Haller 2010). In a rotating system, however, particles can get trapped (Angilella 2010) near vortices. We perform numerical simulations examining trapping of inertial particles in a prototypical rotating flow: an identical pair of rotating Lamb-Oseen vortices, without gravity. Our parameter space includes the particle Stokes number $St$, measuring the particle's inertia, and a density parameter $R$, measuring the particle-to-fluid relative density. We focus on inertial particles that are finitely denser than the fluid. Particles can get indefinitely trapped near the vortices and display extreme clustering into smaller dimensional objects: attracting fixed-points, limit cycles and chaotic attractors. As $St$ increases for a given $R$, we may have an incomplete or complete period-doubling route to chaos, as well as an unusual period-halving route back to a fixed-point attractor. The fraction of trapped particles can vary non-monotonically with $St$. We may even have windows in $St$ for which no particle trapping occurs. At $St$ larger than a critical value, beyond no trapping occurs, significant fractions of particles can spend long but finite times in the vortex vicinity. The inclusion of the Basset-Boussinesq history (BBH) force is imperative in our study due to particle's finite density. BBH force significantly increases the basin of attraction as well as the range of $St$ where trapping can occur. Extreme clustering can be physically significant in planetesimal formation by dust aggregation in protoplanetary disks, phytoplankton aggregation in oceans, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is proposed for identification of the multipole structure of aeroacoustic noise sources from far-field measurements. The method is verified via tests with point multipoles and validated using experimental data on flow-induced cylinder noise and turbulent jet noise.</description>

      <title>How a table modulates the risk of airborne transmission between facing individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airborne transmission has been recognized as an important route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. While coughing and sneezing are spectacular sources of production of infected aerosols with far-reaching airflows, the prevalence of asymptomatic transmissions highlighted the importance of social activities. Gathering around a table, a common scenario of human interactions, not only fixes a typical distance between static interlocutors, but influences airborne transmission, by serving both as a flow diverter and a surface for droplet deposition. Here, we use high-fidelity large-eddy simulations to characterize short-range airborne transmission when two people face each other at a typical table. We show that compared to the natural distance travelled by free buoyant puffs and jets, the distance between the table and the emission constitutes a new length scale that modifies downward exhaled flows, common during nose breathing, speech, and laughter. When the table is close to the emitter, its main effect is to restrict the forward spread of emitted particles. However, if the distance between individuals is too short, particles reaching the recipient become more concentrated, rising transmission risks. Additionally, simulations of forceful exhalations, like laughter, demonstrate that the table acts as a filter that collects medium-sized particles that would have remained in the free jet otherwise, but can in that case be involved in the fomite transmission route. The table introduces a cut-off size for particles that depends on the inertia of the exhaled material, thereby modifying the size distribution of particles suspended in the air.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of the self-similar supersonic Marshak wave problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the similarity solutions for the Marshak wave problem, in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) diffusion approximation and in the supersonic regime. Self-similar solutions exist for a temporal power law surface temperature drive and a material model with power law temperature dependent opacity and energy density. The properties of the solutions in both linear and nonlinear conduction regimes are studied as a function of the temporal drive, opacity and energy density exponents. We show that there exists a range of the temporal exponent for which the total energy in the system decreases, and the solution has a local maxima. For nonlinear conduction, we specify the conditions on the opacity and energy density exponents under which the heat front is linear or even flat, and does posses its common sharp character; this character is independent of the drive exponent. We specify the values of the temporal exponents for which analytical solutions exist and employ the Hammer-Rosen perturbation theory to obtain highly accurate approximate solutions, which are parameterized using only two numerically fitted quantities. The solutions are used to construct a set of benchmarks for supersonic LTE radiative heat transfer, including some with unusual and interesting properties such as local maxima and non sharp fronts. The solutions are compared in detail to implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations as well gray diffusion simulations, showing a good agreement, which highlights their usefulness as a verification test problem for radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy stable gradient flow schemes for shape and topology optimization in Navier-Stokes flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topology optimization governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using a phase field model. Novel stabilized semi-implicit schemes for the gradient flows of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard types are proposed for solving the resulting optimal control problem. Unconditional energy stability is shown for the gradient flow schemes in continuous and discrete spaces. Numerical experiments of computational fluid dynamics in 2d and 3d show the effectiveness and robustness of the optimization algorithms proposed.</description>

      <title>Modeling considerations about a microchannel heat sink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many computational studies on hotspot microfluidic cooling devices found in the literature rely on simplified assumptions and conventions that do not capture the full complexity of the conjugate thermal problem, such as constant thermophysical fluid properties, radiation and free air convection on the external walls. These assumptions are generally applied to typical microfluidic devices with a large number of microchannels and operating at Reynolds numbers between 100-1000. A one microchannel chip is a suitable starting point to analyze more systematically the implications of these assumptions, in particular at lower Reynolds numbers. Although it is a simpler system, it has been studied experimentally and numerically as a basic block of a thermal microfluidic device. In this work we analyze the modeling of the overall heat transfer from a hotspot to a microfluidic heat sink, focusing on the effect of the different thermal transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection and radiation), temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of the fluid and the chip material. The study is developed as a function of the pressure difference applied to the system based on simulations performed using a Finite Volume Method. Analyzing and comparing the different contributions to the energy losses, this work provides a critical discussion of the usually considered approximations, in order to make a reliable modeling of the overall thermal performance of a single rectangular straight channel embedded in a PDMS microfluidic chip.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en waves at low Magnetic Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper seeks whether Alfv\'en waves (AW) can be produced in laboratory-scale liquid metal experiments, \emph{i.e.) at low-magnetic Reynolds Number ($R\!m$). AW are incompressible waves propagating along magnetic fields typically found geo and astrophysical systems. Until now, only faint linear waves have been experimentally produced in liquid metals because of the large magnetic dissipation they undergo when $R\!m\ll1$. Yet, controlling laboratory AW could emulate such far remote processes as anomalous heating in the solar corona, oscillations of the Earth inner core or turbulence in the solar wind. To answer this question, we force AW with an AC electric current in a liquid metal channel in a transverse magnetic field. We derive a wave-bearing extension of the usual low$-R\!m$ MHD approximation to identify two linear regimes: The purely diffusive regime exists when $N_\omega$, the ratio of the oscillation period to the timescale of diffusive two-dimensionalisation by the Lorentz force, is small. The propagative regime is governed by the ratio of the forcing period to the AW propagation timescale which, we call the Jameson number $J\!a$ after Jameson (1964), JFM. In this regime, AW are dissipative and dispersive as they propagate more slowly where velocity gradients are higher. Both regimes are recovered in the FLOWCUBE experiment, in excellent agreement with the model up to $J\!a \lesssim 0.85$ but near the $J\!a=1$ resonance, high amplitude waves become clearly nonlinear. Hence, in electrically driving AW, we were able to produce some of the propagative, diffusive and nonlinear processes of astro and geophysical AW.</description>
