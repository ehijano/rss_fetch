      <title>On a generalization of Godbersen's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing Godbersen's conjecture asserts that the Rogers-Shephard inequality for the volume of the difference body is refined by an inequality for the mixed volume of a convex body and its reflection in the origin. The conjecture is known in several special cases, notably for anti-blocking convex bodies. In this note, we propose a generalization of Godbersen's conjecture that refines Schneider's generalization of the Rogers-Shephard inequality to higher-order difference bodies and prove our conjecture for anti-blocking convex bodies. Moreover, we relate the conjectured inequality to the higher-rank mixed volume defined by the author and Wannerer which leads to an equivalent formulation in terms of the Alesker product of smooth, translation invariant valuations.</description>

      <title>Nash entropy, Calabi energy and geometric regularization of singular K\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove uniform Sobolev bounds for solutions of the Laplace equation on a general family of K\"ahler manifolds with bounded Nash entropy and Calabi energy. These estimates establish a connection to the theory of RCD spaces and provide abundant examples of RCD spaces topologically and holomorphically equivalent to projective varieties. Suppose $X$ is a normal projective variety that admits a resolution of singularities with relative nef or relative effective anti-canonical bundle. Then every admissible singular K\"ahler metric on $X$ with Ricci curvature bounded below induces a non-collapsed RCD space homeomorphic to the projective variety $X$ itself.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity formula and stratification of the singular set of perimeter minimizers in RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to establish a monotonicity formula for perimeter minimizing sets in RCD(0,N) metric measure cones, together with the associated rigidity statement. The applications include sharp Hausdorff dimension estimates for the singular strata of perimeter minimizing sets in non collapsed RCD spaces and the existence of blow-down cones for global perimeter minimizers in Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth.</description>

      <title>A review of the tangent space in sub-Finsler geometry and applications to the failure of the $\mathsf{CD}$ condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the construction of the tangent space to a sub-Finsler manifold in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Under suitable assumptions on the measure, the metric measure tangent is described by the nilpotent approximation, equipped with a scalar multiple of the Lebesgue measure. We apply this result in the study of the Lott-Sturm-Villani curvature-dimension condition in sub-Finsler geometry. In particular, we show the failure of the $\mathsf{CD}$ condition in 3D-contact sub-Finsler manifolds, equipped with a bounded measure.</description>

      <title>The Polytope of Probability Functions on a Finite Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kim, Kim, and Neggers (2019) defined probability functions on a poset, by listing some very natural conditions that a function \(\pi: P \times P \to [0,1]\) should satisfy in order to capture the intuition of "the likelihood that \(a\) precedes \(b\) in \(P\)". In particular, this generalizes the common notion of poset probability for finite posets, where \(\pi(a,b)\) is the proportion of linear extensions of \(P\) in which \(a\) precedes \(b\).
  They constructed a family of such functions for posets embedded in the ordered plane; that is two say, for posets of order dimension at most two.
  We study probability functions of a finite poset \(P\) by constructing an ancillary poset \(\tilde{P}\), that we call *probability functions posets*. The relations of this new poset encodes the restrictions imposed on probability functions of the original poset by the conditions of the definition. Then, we define the probability functions polytope, which parameterizes the probability functions on \(P\), and show that it can be realized as the order polytope of \(\tilde{P}\) intersected by a certain affine subspace.
  We give a partial description of the vertices of probability functions polytope and show that, in contrast to the order polytope, it is not always a lattice polytope.</description>
