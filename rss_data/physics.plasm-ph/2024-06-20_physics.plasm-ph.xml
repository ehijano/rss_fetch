      <title>Simulating nonlinear optical processes on a superconducting quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating plasma physics on quantum computers is difficult, because most problems of interest are nonlinear, but quantum computers are not naturally suitable for nonlinear operations. In weakly nonlinear regimes, plasma problems can be modeled as wave-wave interactions. In this paper, we develop a quantization approach to convert nonlinear wave-wave interaction problems to Hamiltonian simulation problems. We demonstrate our approach using two qubits on a superconducting device. Unlike a photonic device, a superconducting device does not naturally have the desired interactions in its native Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, Hamiltonian simulations can still be performed by decomposing required unitary operations into native gates. To improve experimental results, we employ a range of error mitigation techniques. Apart from readout error mitigation, we use randomized compilation to transform undiagnosed coherent errors into well-behaved stochastic Pauli channels. Moreover, to compensate for stochastic noise, we rescale exponentially decaying probability amplitudes using rates measured from cycle benchmarking. We carefully consider how different choices of product-formula algorithms affect the overall error and show how a trade-off can be made to best utilize limited quantum resources. This study provides a point example of how plasma problems may be solved on near-term quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Mode Coupling and Breathing Oscillation in Partially Magnetized Cross-Field Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on investigations of mode coupling between rotating spokes during the onset of the breathing oscillation. Demonstrating the existence of nonlinear coupling between the sporadic spokes and the breathing oscillation, we suggest the oscillating azimuthal electric field as the energy source for additional ionization within the plasma. Our results indicate that intermittent three-wave coupling is a possible mechanism for triggering low-frequency breathing oscillations in partially magnetized cross-field plasma.</description>

      <title>Sheath effects with thermal electrons on the resonance frequency of a DC-biased hairpin probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric constant of a sheath, whether ionic or electronic, formed around the cylindrical limbs of a hairpin probe, is often considered the same as that of a vacuum. However, this assumption does not hold true for electron sheaths and electron-permeating ionic sheaths, resulting in a deviation of the sheath dielectric constant from that of a vacuum. This deviation significantly influences the effective dielectric between the cylindrical limbs. As a result, it impacts the theoretically estimated resonance frequency characteristic curve of a DC-biased hairpin probe. In this study, we investigate the influence of electron temperature on the sheath dielectric and, consequently, on the resonance frequency characteristic curve. The findings shows that electron temperature primarily determines the resonance frequency characteristic curve. With increasing electron temperature, the peak in the resonance frequency characteristic curve shifts towards higher positive probe bias values and exhibits a broadening near the maxima instead of a sharp peak. This broadening near the maxima has also been validated with an experimentally measured resonance frequency characteristic curve in a capacitively coupled argon discharge.</description>

      <title>Development of Volume Produced Negative Ion Source using a CCRF Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows the development of a volume-produced negative ion source that consists of annular parallel plates driven by a 13.56 MHz capacitively coupled radio frequency in a push-pull configuration. This source shows advantages in controlling plasma conditions by varying the pressure, power, and applied axial magnetic field. It is found that the push-pull configuration allows the plasma potential to remain in the range of 20 to 40 Volts. Conversely, the application of a magnetic field helps serves to augment the production of negative ions in the central hollow part of the annular plate. Further, a plausible explanation to the obtained experimental results is presented.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear modulation of dispersive fast magnetosonic waves in an inhomogeneous rotating solar low-$\beta$ magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modulation of fast magnetosonic waves (MSWs) in rotating inhomogeneous low-$\beta$ magnetoplasmas with the effects of gravitation and the Coriolis force. By employing the standard multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique (RPT), we derive a nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation that governs the evolution of slowly varying MSW envelopes. The fast MSW becomes dispersive by the effects of the Coriolis force in the fluid motion, and the magnetic field and density inhomogeneity effects favor the Jeans instability in self-gravitating plasmas in a larger domain of the wave number ($k$, below the Jeans critical wave number, $k_J$) than homogeneous plasmas. The relative influence of the Jeans frequency ($\omega_J$, associated with the gravitational force) and the angular frequency ($\Omega_0$, relating to the Coriolis force) on the Jeans carrier MSW mode and the modulational instability (MI) of the MSW envelope is studied. We show that the MSW envelope (corresponding to the unstable carrier Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ and $k&lt;k_J$) is always unstable against the plane wave perturbation with no cut-offs for growth rates. In contrast, the stable Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ but $k&gt;k_J$ manifests either modulational stability or MI having a finite growth rate before being cut off. We find an enhancement of the MI growth rate by the influence of magnetic field or density inhomogeneity. The case with constant gravity force (other than the self-gravity) perpendicular to the magnetic field is also briefly discussed to show that the fast magnetosonic carrier mode is always unstable, giving MI of slowly varying envelopes with no cut-offs for the growth rates. Possible applications of MI in solar plasmas, such as those in the X-ray corona, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear drift kinetic theory of alpha particle transport by neoclassical tearing modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic theory of particles near resonances is a current topic of discussion in plasma physics and astrophysics. We extend this discussion to the kinetic theory of the interaction between alpha particles (energetic particles predicted to exist in large quantities in next-generation fusion experiments) and a neoclassical tearing mode (NTM), a resistively-driven perturbation that sometimes exists in a tokamak. We develop a quasilinear treatment of the interaction between alphas and an NTM, showing why an NTM can be a source of significant passing alpha particle transport in tokamaks. The limitations on quasilinear theory constrain our theory's applicability to small amplitude NTMs, highlighting the importance of nonlinear studies.</description>

      <title>Barrier discharges in CO$_2$ -- optical emission spectra analysis and E/N determination from intensity ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study barrier discharges in CO$_2$ using optical emission spectroscopy and electrical measurements. We record the spectra of weak CO$_2$ barrier discharge emission in UV-VIS-NIR range. The CO spectral bands of 3rd positive, Angstrom and Asundi systems are identified in the spectra, together with the CO+2 bands of the UV-doublet and the Fox-Duffendack-Baker systems. The effect of CO$_2$ flow rate variations on the relative intensities of the CO and CO$_2$ optical emissions is also investigated. We analyze the optical emission of selected vibrational spectral bands and attempt to determine the E/N using intensity ratio method with kinetic data available in the literature. The method, using intensities from different spectral bands, is tested on sinusoidal driven atmospheric pressure Townsend (APTD) and single-filament barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure. For APTD at different flows and known CO conversion factors, an attempt is made to use the ratio of selected CO to CO$_2$ band intensities. The technique of time-correlated single photon counting is used to obtain necessary sub-nanosecond temporal resolution and, importantly, high signal sensitivity for the single-filament experiment and its utilization gives a promising result, E/N of 330 Td in barrier discharge streamer. Nevertheless, the uncertainties coming from different kinetic data and the low sensitivity of some rate coefficient ratios complicate an easy utilisation of the method. Future steps are therefore proposed, including uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the simplified model and necessary CO+2 and CO synthetic spectra fitting.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent strong screening applied to thermonuclear reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent strong plasma screening around light nuclei is implemented in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch to determine the short-range screening potential, $e\phi(r)/T \geq 1$, relevant for thermonuclear reactions. We numerically solve the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation incorporating Fermi-Dirac statistics adopting a generalized screening mass to find the electric potential in the cosmic BBN electron-positron plasma for finite-sized $^4$He nuclei as an example. Although the plasma follows Boltzmann statistics at large distances, Fermi-Dirac statistics is necessary when work performed by ions on electrons is comparable to their rest mass energy. While strong screening effects are generally minor due to the high BBN temperatures, they can enhance the fusion rates of high-$Z&gt;2$ elements while leaving fusion rates of lower-$Z\le 2$ elements relatively unaffected. Our results also reveal a pronounced spatial dependence of the strong screening potential near the nuclear surface. These findings about the electron-positron plasma's role refine BBN theory predictions and offer broader applications for studying weakly coupled plasmas in diverse cosmic and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Picturing global substorm dynamics in the magnetotail using low-altitude ELFIN measurements and data mining-based magnetic field reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global reconfiguration of the magnetotail characterizes substorms. Current sheet thinning, intensification, and magnetic field stretching are defining features of the substorm growth phase and their spatial distributions control the timing and location of substorm onset. Presently, sparse in-situ observations cannot resolve these distributions. A promising approach is to use new substorm magnetic field reconstruction methods based on data mining, termed SST19. Here we compare the SST19 reconstructions to low-altitude ELFIN measurements of energetic particle precipitations to probe the radial profile of the equatorial magnetic field curvature during a 19~August 2022 substorm. ELFIN and SST19 yield a consistent dynamical picture of the magnetotail during the growth phase and capture expected features such as the formation of a thin current sheet and its earthward motion. Furthermore, they resolve a V-like pattern of isotropic electron precipitation boundaries in the time-energy plane, consistent with earlier observations but now over a broad energy range.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Efficiency Microwave Heating Producing Record Highly Charged Xenon Ion Beams with Superconducting ECR Ion Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense highly charged ion beam production is essential for high-power heavy ion accelerators. A novel movable Vlasov launcher for superconducting high charge state Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source has been devised that can affect the microwave power effectiveness by a factor of about 4 in terms of highly charged ion beam production. This approach based on a dedicated microwave launching system instead of the traditional coupling scheme has led to new insight on microwave-plasma interaction. With this new understanding, the world record highly charged xenon ion beam currents have been enhanced by up to a factor of 2, which could directly and significantly enhance the performance of heavy ion accelerators and provide many new research opportunities in nuclear physics, atomic physics and other disciplines.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability Aspects Near the Parker Sonic Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the first ever systematic theoretical formulation to address the long-standing issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This is predicated on the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. For this purpose, a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics is given, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework to accomplish this task. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>Scaling up global kinetic models of pulsar magnetospheres using a hybrid force-free-PIC numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-in-cell approach has proven effective at modeling neutron star and black hole magnetospheres from first principles, but global simulations are plagued with an unrealistically small separation between the scales where microphysics operates and the system-size scales due to limited numerical resources. A legitimate concern is whether the scale separation currently achieved is large enough, such that results can be safely extrapolated to realistic scales. In this work, our aim is to explore the effect of scaling physical parameters up, and to check whether salient features uncovered by pure kinetic models at smaller scales are still valid, with a special emphasis on particle acceleration and high-energy radiation emitted beyond the light cylinder. To reach this objective, we develop a new hybrid numerical scheme coupling the ideal force-free and the particle-in-cell methods, to optimize the numerical cost of global models. We propose a domain decomposition of the magnetosphere based on the magnetic field topology using the flux function. The force-free model is enforced along open field lines while the particle-in-cell model is restricted to the reconnecting field line region. As a proof of concept, this new hybrid model is applied to simulate a weak millisecond pulsar magnetosphere with realistic scales using high-resolution axisymmetric simulations. Magnetospheric features reported by previous kinetic models are recovered, and strong synchrotron radiation above 100MeV consistent with the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar population is successfully reproduced. This work further consolidates the shining reconnecting current sheet scenario as the origin of the gamma-ray emission in pulsars, as well as firmly establishes pulsar magnetospheres as at least TeV particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Plasma modes in QED super-strong magnetic fields of magnetars and laser plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-magnetized plasmas, where the magnetic field strength exceeds the Schwinger field of about $B_{Q}\approx4\times10^{13}$~gauss, become of great scientific interest, thanks to the current advances in laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations of magnetar emission. These advances demand better understanding of how quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects influence collective plasma phenomena. In particular, Maxwell's equations become nonlinear in the strong-QED regime. Here we present the `QED plasma framework' which will allow one to {\em systematically} explore collective phenomena in a QED-plasma with arbitrarily strong magnetic field. Further, we illustrate the framework by exploring low-frequency modes in the ultra-magnetized, cold, electron-positron plasmas. We demonstrate that the classical picture of five branches holds in the QED regime; no new eigenmodes appear. The dispersion curves of all the modes are modified. The QED effects include the overall modification to the plasma frequency, which becomes field-dependent. They also modify resonances and cutoffs of the modes, which become both field- and angle-dependent. The strongest effects are (i) the {\em field-induced transparency of plasma} for the O-mode via the dramatic reduction of the low-frequency cutoff well below the plasma frequency, (ii) the {\em Alfven mode suppression} in the large-$k$ regime via the reduction of the Alfven mode resonance, and (iii) the {\em O-mode slowdown} via strong angle-dependent increase of the index of refraction. These results should be important for understanding of a magnetospheric pair plasma of a magnetar and for laboratory laser-plasma experiments in the QED regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active feedback control in magnetic confinement fusion devices is desirable to mitigate plasma instabilities and enable robust operation. Optical high-speed cameras provide a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic and can be suitable for these applications. In this study, we process fast camera data, at rates exceeding 100kfps, on $\textit{in situ}$ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to track magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode evolution and generate control signals in real-time. Our system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts the $n$=1 MHD mode amplitude and phase using camera images with better accuracy than other tested non-deep-learning-based methods. By implementing this model directly within the standard FPGA readout hardware of the high-speed camera diagnostic, our mode tracking system achieves a total trigger-to-output latency of 17.6$\mu$s and a throughput of up to 120kfps. This study at the High Beta Tokamak-Extended Pulse (HBT-EP) experiment demonstrates an FPGA-based high-speed camera data acquisition and processing system, enabling application in real-time machine-learning-based tokamak diagnostic and control as well as potential applications in other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Generation of THz waves through interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study explores radiation in THz spectrum region through the interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma. The interaction of the two-color laser with plasma electrons induces transverse nonlinear current in two dimensions, resulting in generation of a wakefield and a forward wave. The investigation revealed that during the non-relativistic regime of laser-plasma interaction, interdependence exists between the electric fields of the forward wave and the wake. Conversely, in the relativistic regime, the dynamic of interaction changes, and plasma electrons are influenced not only by the electric field of the laser pulse but also by relativistic effects like Lorentz contraction, responding to both the electric and magnetic field components. This leads to generation of wake and forward wave radiations. The interplay between various laser and plasma parameters is analyzed, shedding light on the conditions leading to radiation angular distribution patterns in the forward and backward directions. The impact of spatial laser profile, a DC external magnetic field, polarization states, and plasma interaction length on the generated wake and forward wave patterns has been investigated. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the objective is to elucidate the controlled directional features of the resulting fields and radiation patterns.</description>

Abstract: Emission of terahertz waves in free electron lasers (FELs) with both planar (linear) and helical undulators has been explored. The analysis employs Lienard-Wiechert fields to characterize FEL radiation within the THz region. Specifically, the study delves into the analytical examination of radiation pattern of THz waves, which provides insight into the angular distribution of radiation energy. The variations of radiation pattern for various parameters such as different harmonics, Lorentz factor, magnetic parameter, and total number of periods of planar and helical undulators were investigated. The Fourier transform of free electron laser electric field is showcased across four distinct sets of FEL parameters. The interplay between electron beam and undulators parameters sheds light on how these factors influence the directionality of THz waves. Simulation results indicate that planar undulators often produce radiation with noticeable side lobes, especially at higher harmonics, while helical undulators typically exhibit reduced side lobes, resulting in a more focused main radiation peak. However, the radiation pattern of THz waves tends to concentrate predominantly in the forward direction and the polarization of the emitted radiation is determined by the properties of the undulator and electron beam, rather than the specific undulator geometry. The study underscores that an optimal selection of undulator and beam parameters can effectively maximize the angular distribution of emitted radiation.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Energetic Electron Fluxes from 150 km to 20,000 km: an ELFIN-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05579</link>

Abstract: The strong variations of energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere are notoriously hard to forecast. Developing accurate empirical models of electron fluxes from low to high altitudes at all latitudes is therefore useful to improve our understanding of flux variations and to assess radiation hazards for spacecraft systems. In the present work, energy- and pitch-angle-resolved precipitating, trapped, and backscattered electron fluxes measured at low altitude by Electron Loss and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) CubeSats are used to infer omnidirectional fluxes at altitudes below and above the spacecraft, from 150 km to 20,000 km, making use of adiabatic transport theory and quasi-linear diffusion theory. The inferred fluxes are fitted as a function of selected parameters using a stepwise multivariate optimization procedure, providing an analytical model of omnidirectional electron flux along each geomagnetic field line, based on measurements from only one spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The modeled electron fluxes are provided as a function of $L$-shell, altitude, energy, and two different indices of past geomagnetic activity, computed over the preceding 4 hours or 3 days, potentially allowing to disentangle impulsive processes (such as rapid injections) from cumulative processes (such as inward radial diffusion and wave-driven energization). The model is validated through comparisons with equatorial measurements from the Van Allen Probes, demonstrating the broad applicability of the present method. The model indicates that both impulsive and time-integrated geomagnetic activity partly control electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt and in the plasma sheet.</description>
