      <title>Visualisation of spherical harmonics in Peirce's quincuncial projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi)$ are complex-valued functions on the surface of a sphere, and have found widespread application in physics and astronomy. Every physics students knows them from quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory, where they form the basis of hydrogen orbitals and of the multipole expansion, respectively. More advanced applications include the physics of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves. In this paper I aim to contrast their usual $3d$ visualisation with Peirce's quincuncial projection, a conformal projection of the sphere onto a $2d$ unfolded square dihedron, where the projection respects the fundamental rotational symmetries and preserves angles. With this mapping, I guide the reader through the properties of the spherical harmonics in a pedagogical way and show that many of their mathematical relations have an intuitive visualisation on Peirce's $2d$ map, which might be useful for people challenged by processing $3d$ shapes, or which people might appreciate aesthetically.</description>

      <title>The Soul of Waves: Physical Interpretation of Dispersion Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This pedagogical paper presents a comprehensive framework for interpreting dispersion relations across fundamental physical systems. We adopt a novel approach that starts from the mathematical form $\omega(\mathbf{k})$ and systematically extracts its physical content, rather than deriving it from first principles. Through an in-depth case study of the massive Klein-Gordon dispersion relation $\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + c^2k^2$, we demonstrate how this single equation encodes phase velocity, group velocity, density of states, effective mass, and impedance. The analysis reveals the universal nature of this dispersion form, which manifests in quantum fields, plasmas, superconductors, and photonic crystals with different physical interpretations of its parameters. We complement this with detailed examination of classical systems including mass-spring chains and hydrodynamic waves, providing tangible analogies that bridge conceptual understanding between quantum and classical wave phenomena. The paper includes eleven carefully designed figures that visualize key concepts and a comprehensive catalog of dispersion relations in the Appendix. Aimed at advanced undergraduates and instructors, this work emphasizes conceptual understanding through physical interpretation, offering a unified pedagogical framework for teaching wave propagation across physics curricula while maintaining mathematical rigor and depth.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Moment Matrix Blocks Spectra using Mutual Shadow Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mutual shadow area of pairs of surface regions is used for guiding the study of the spectral components and rank of their wave interaction, as captured by the corresponding moment matrix blocks. It is demonstrated that the mutual shadow area provides an asymptotically accurate predictor of the location of the singular value curve knee. This predicted knee index is shown to partition the interacting parts of the range and domain of blocks into two subspaces that can be associated with different wave phenomena: an "aperture" subspace of dimension that scales with the subdomains area (or length in 2-D) and a remainder "diffraction" subspace of dimension that scales much slower with the electrical length, depending on the geometric configuration. For interactions between open surface domains typical for the common hierarchical partitioning in most fast solvers, the latter can be attributed to the domain edges visible by its interacting counterpart. For interactions in 3-D with a small aspect angles between the source and observers, the diffraction subspace dimension is dominant in determining the rank until fairly large electrical lengths are reached. This explains the delayed asymptotic scaling of ranks and impressive fast solver performance observed in recent literature for seemingly arbitrary scatterers with no special geometric characteristics. In the extreme cases of "endfire" reduced dimensionality interactions, where the shadow area vanishes, the diffraction governs also the asymptotic rank, which translates to superior asymptotic solver performance.</description>

      <title>Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</description>

      <title>For the use of exterior form in daily physics, an introduction without coordinate frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a short introduction of the exterior form formalism focus on its applications in physics and then mostly aimed to physics students. As a rule of a game played here we never use a coordinate frame neither in the definitions nor in the proofs but only at the end in order to recover the classical physics equations. This approach is unusual but we think is helpful for the understanding and very valuable to grab the physical meanings of the mathematical object.</description>

      <title>Lambert's problem in orbital dynamics: a self--contained introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a "free fall" trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest unperturbed case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>Topological aspects of zero modes in cavity resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the zero modes of electromagnetic fields in a cavity resonator and the cavity's topological characteristics. We show that the dimension of the electromagnetic zero-mode space coincides with the dimension of the corresponding homology group of the cavity. Moreover, we prove that the alternating sum of the dimensions of the electromagnetic zero-mode spaces is closely related to the Euler characteristic of the cavity boundary, and hence to the integral of the curvature.</description>
