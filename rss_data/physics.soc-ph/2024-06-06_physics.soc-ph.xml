      <title>Mitigating an epidemic on a geographic network using vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model describing the propagation of an epidemic on a geographical network. The size of the outbreak is governed by the initial growth rate of the disease given by the maximal eigenvalue of the epidemic matrix formed by the susceptibles and the graph Laplacian representing the mobility. We use matrix perturbation theory to analyze the epidemic matrix and define a vaccination strategy, assuming the vaccination reduces the susceptibles. When mobility and local disease dynamics have similar time scales, it is most efficient to vaccinate the whole network because the disease grows uniformly. However, if only a few vertices can be vaccinated then which ones do we choose? We answer this question, and show that it is most efficient to vaccinate along an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian. We illustrate these general results on a 7 vertex graph and a realistic example of the french rail network. When mobility is slower than local disease dynamics, the epidemic grows on the vertex with largest susceptibles. The epidemic growth rate is more reduced when vaccinating a larger degree vertex; it also depends on the neighboring vertices. This study and its conclusions provides guidelines for the planning of vaccination on a network at the onset of an epidemic.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Risk of Proliferation via Fissile Material Breeding in ARC-class Fusion Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Construction of a nuclear weapon requires access to kilogram-scale quantities of fissile material, which can be bred from fertile material like U-238 and Th-232 via neutron capture. Future fusion power plants, with total neutron source rates in excess of $10^{20}$ n/s, could breed weapons-relevant quantities of fissile material on short timescales, posing a breakout proliferation risk. The ARC-class fusion reactor design is characterized by demountable high temperature superconducting magnets, a FLiBe liquid immersion blanket, and a relatively small size ($\sim$ 4 m major radius, $\sim$ 1 m minor radius). We use the open-source Monte Carlo neutronics code OpenMC to perform self-consistent time-dependent simulations of a representative ARC-class blanket to assess the feasibility of a fissile breeding breakout scenario. We find that a significant quantity of fissile material can be bred in less than six months of full power operation for initial fertile inventories ranging from 5 to 50 metric tons, representing a non-negligible proliferation risk. We further study the feasibility of this scenario by examining other consequences of fissile breeding such as reduced tritium breeding ratio, extra heat from fission and decay heat, isotopic purity of bred material, and self-protection time of irradiated blanket material. We also examine the impact of Li-6 enrichment on fissile breeding and find that it substantially reduces breeding rate, motivating its use as a proliferation resistance tool.</description>
