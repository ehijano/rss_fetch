      <title>Multimodal Semantic Communication for Generative Audio-Driven Video Conferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an efficient multimodal data communication scheme for video conferencing. In our considered system, a speaker gives a talk to the audiences, with talking head video and audio being transmitted. Since the speaker does not frequently change posture and high-fidelity transmission of audio (speech and music) is required, redundant visual video data exists and can be removed by generating the video from the audio. To this end, we propose a wave-to-video (Wav2Vid) system, an efficient video transmission framework that reduces transmitted data by generating talking head video from audio. In particular, full-duration audio and short-duration video data are synchronously transmitted through a wireless channel, with neural networks (NNs) extracting and encoding audio and video semantics. The receiver then combines the decoded audio and video data, as well as uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) based model to generate the lip movement videos of the speaker. Simulation results show that the proposed Wav2Vid system can reduce the amount of transmitted data by up to 83% while maintaining the perceptual quality of the generated conferencing video.</description>

      <title>Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Virtual Reality Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10811v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatial computing Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with VR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in VR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to VR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of VR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Producer vs. Rapper: Who Dominates the Hip Hop Sound? A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hip-hop music, rappers and producers play important, but rather different roles. However, both contribute to the overall sound, as rappers bring in their voice, while producers are responsible for the music composition and mix. In this case report, we trained Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) with songs produced by Dr. Dre, Rick Rubin and Timbaland using the goniometer and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). With these maps, we investigate whether hip hop producers have a unique sound profile. Then, we test whether collaborations with the rappers Eminem, Jay-Z, LL Cool J and Nas stick to, or break out of this sound profile. As these rappers are also producers of some songs, we investigate how much their sound profile is influenced by the producers who introduced them to beat making. The results speak a clear language: producers have their own sound profile that is unique concerning the goniometer, and less distinct concerning MFCCs. They dominate the sound of hip hop music over rappers, who emulate the sound profile of the producers who introduced them to beat making.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation for Real-Time Classification of Early Media in Voice Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the industrial setting of real-time classification of early media exchanged during the initialization phase of voice calls. We explore the application of state-of-the-art audio tagging models and highlight some limitations when applied to the classification of early media. While most existing approaches leverage convolutional neural networks, we propose a novel approach for low-resource requirements based on gradient-boosted trees. Our approach not only demonstrates a substantial improvement in runtime performance, but also exhibits a comparable accuracy. We show that leveraging knowledge distillation and class aggregation techniques to train a simpler and smaller model accelerates the classification of early media in voice calls. We provide a detailed analysis of the results on a proprietary and publicly available dataset, regarding accuracy and runtime performance. We additionally report a case study of the achieved performance improvements at a regional data center in India.</description>

      <title>Feature distribution Adaptation Network for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22023v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel deep inductive transfer learning framework, named feature distribution adaptation network, to tackle the challenging multi-modal speech emotion recognition problem. Our method aims to use deep transfer learning strategies to align visual and audio feature distributions to obtain consistent representation of emotion, thereby improving the performance of speech emotion recognition. In our model, the pre-trained ResNet-34 is utilized for feature extraction for facial expression images and acoustic Mel spectrograms, respectively. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.</description>

      <title>CHORDONOMICON: A Dataset of 666,000 Songs and their Chord Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chord progressions encapsulate important information about music, pertaining to its structure and conveyed emotions. They serve as the backbone of musical composition, and in many cases, they are the sole information required for a musician to play along and follow the music. Despite their importance, chord progressions as a data domain remain underexplored. There is a lack of large-scale datasets suitable for deep learning applications, and limited research exploring chord progressions as an input modality. In this work, we present Chordonomicon, a dataset of over 666,000 songs and their chord progressions, annotated with structural parts, genre, and release date - created by scraping various sources of user-generated progressions and associated metadata. We demonstrate the practical utility of the Chordonomicon dataset for classification and generation tasks, and discuss its potential to provide valuable insights to the research community. Chord progressions are unique in their ability to be represented in multiple formats (e.g. text, graph) and the wealth of information chords convey in given contexts, such as their harmonic function . These characteristics make the Chordonomicon an ideal testbed for exploring advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers, graph machine learning, and hybrid systems that combine knowledge representation and machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <title>Structured Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement via Style Prior Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet presents significant challenges. Such challenges include maintaining track cohesion, ensuring long-term coherence, and optimizing computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is generated by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. Our key design is the use of vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of the orchestration style, which enables flexible, controllable, and structured music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity while improving efficiency. Additionally, our system supports a variety of music genres and provides style control at different composition hierarchies. We further show that our system achieves superior coherence, structure, and overall arrangement quality compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters. Implementation and Checkpoints are available at https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Encoder-Free Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) mostly rely on vision encoders to extract visual features followed by large language models (LLMs) for visual-language tasks. However, the vision encoders set a strong inductive bias in abstracting visual representation, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, and semantic priors, which could impede the flexibility and efficiency of the VLMs. Training pure VLMs that accept the seamless vision and language inputs, i.e., without vision encoders, remains challenging and rarely explored. Empirical observations reveal that direct training without encoders results in slow convergence and large performance gaps. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-based and encoder-free models, and present a simple yet effective training recipe towards pure VLMs. Specifically, we unveil the key aspects of training encoder-free VLMs efficiently via thorough experiments: (1) Bridging vision-language representation inside one unified decoder; (2) Enhancing visual recognition capability via extra supervision. With these strategies, we launch EVE, an encoder-free vision-language model that can be trained and forwarded efficiently. Notably, solely utilizing 35M publicly accessible data, EVE can impressively rival the encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks. It significantly outperforms the counterpart Fuyu-8B with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. We believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across modalities. Our code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/baaivision/EVE.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.</description>
