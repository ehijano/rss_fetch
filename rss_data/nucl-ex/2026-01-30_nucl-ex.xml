      <title>The $^{8}$Be nucleus and the Hoyle state in dissociation of relativistic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The review presents the key results and generalizations of the BECQUEREL experiment at JINR, obtained in the study of unstable nuclear states in the relativistic dissociation of a wide variety of nuclei. The productivity of this method is ensured by record-breaking spatial resolution and full sensitivity to relativistic fragments. According to invariant masses calculated on the basis of precise data of emission angles in the extremely narrow fragmentation cone, the contributions of the decays of $^8$Be(0$^+$), $^8$Be(2$^+$), $^9$Be(1.7), $^9$B, $^6$Be, $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) or the Hoyle state and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) have been identified now. The increase in the contribution of $^8$Be(0$^+$) with the multiplicity of accompanying $\alpha$-particles, followed by $^9$B and $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$), has been established. The structure of these states and the diversity of parent nuclei without the influence of the initial energy assume the coalescence of $\alpha$-particles and nucleons which appear in dissociation. The initial density and duration of the secondary interaction of the latter may be sufficient up to the lowest-energy fusion reactions. Such a scenario requires low-energy physics concepts to interpret the relativistic fragmentation. The usage of automated microscopy for the analysis of irradiation beams from the JINR NICA accelerator complex becomes a modern basis to apply the nuclear emulsion method which has become fundamental in the physics of the micro-world. Having become observable since the pioneering era of cosmic ray physics fragmentation, the events of relativistic nuclei in nuclear emulsions highlight the potential of this method to study extremely cold ensembles of H and He nuclei, thereby advancing the physics of nuclear clustering and, potentially, expanding nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Particle-Identification Silicon-Telescope Array Coupled with the VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Particle-Identification Silicon-Telescope Array (PISTA) is a new detection system designed for high-resolution studies of the fission process induced by multi-nucleon transfer in inverse kinematics. It is specifically optimized for experiments with the VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer at GANIL (Grand Acc\'el\'erateur National d'Ions Lourds). The array comprises eight trapezoidal $\Delta$E-E silicon telescopes arranged in a corolla configuration. Each telescope integrates two single-sided stripped silicon detectors, enabling target-like recoil identification, energy loss measurements, and trajectory reconstruction. Positioned in close proximity to the target, PISTA's compact geometry achieves high-efficiency tracking of target-like recoils produced in multi-nucleon transfer reactions at Coulomb barrier energies. The spatial segmentation of the array allows precise determination of the mass and charge of the target-like nucleus, and excitation energy of fissioning systems. This work presents the particle identification and excitation energy reconstruction performances for the interactions of $^{238}$U beam with $^{12}$C target. An excitation energy resolution of 870 keV (FWHM) was determined together with mass resolution of 1.1\% (FWHM). The combination of PISTA and VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer enables unprecedented investigations of the fission process as a function of the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus, particularly for exotic systems produced in transfer-induced reactions.</description>

      <title>From Beam to Bedside: Reinforcing Domestic Supply of $^{99}$Mo/$^{99m}$Tc using Novel High-Current D+ Cyclotrons for Compact Neutron Generation and $^{99}$Mo Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technetium-99m ($^{99m}$Tc) is essential to more than 16 million diagnostic procedures performed annually in the United States. It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns. This work presents the physics motivation, technical design considerations, and projected neutron yields, outlining a pathway from a neutrino-physics prototype to a biomedical isotope production platform.</description>

      <title>Nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from radiatively-corrected antineutrino scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon axial-vector form factor, $G_A$, is critical to determine the electroweak interactions of leptons with nucleons. Important examples of processes influenced by $G_A$ are elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering and muon capture by the proton. Sparse experimental data results in a large uncertainty on the momentum dependence of $G_A$ and has motivated the consideration of new experimental probes and first-principles lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) evaluations. The comparison of new and precise theoretical predictions for $G_A$ with future experimental data necessitates the application of radiative corrections to experimentally-observable processes. We apply these corrections in the extraction of $G_A$ and the associated axial-vector radius from the recent MINERvA antineutrino-hydrogen data, compare the effects from radiative corrections to other uncertainties in neutrino scattering experiments, and discuss the comparison of lattice QCD evaluations to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Resonance Contributions to Radiative Corrections in Charged-Current Elastic (Anti)Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering at GeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of virtual resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>
