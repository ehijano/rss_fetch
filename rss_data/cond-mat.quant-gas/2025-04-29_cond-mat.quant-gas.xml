      <title>Learning the Position of Image Vortices from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The point vortex model is an idealized model for describing the dynamics of many vortices with numerical efficiency, and has been shown to be powerful in modeling the dynamics of vortices in a superfluid. The model can be extended to describe vortices in fluids with a well defined boundary, as an image vortex can be added to the equations of motion to impose the correct velocity profile at the boundary. The mathematical formulation of the image vortex depends on the boundary in question, and is well known for a wide variety of problems, although the formulation of an image vortex in a fluid with a soft boundary remains under debate, as the boundary condition is ill-posed. Such a boundary is common-place in the dynamics of a vortex in an ultra-cold atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, for example, which is typically trapped in a harmonic potential.
  In order to address this problem, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics framework is applied to data from mean-field simulations to extract an approximate point vortex model for a vortex in a circular power law trapping potential. A formulation for the position of an image vortex in such a trap is presented, and the accuracy of this model is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Texture evolution during the development of turbulence in a trapped atomic superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of out-of-equilibrium systems, such as turbulent Bose-Einstein condensates, remains a significant challenge. Identifying characteristic timescales is crucial for describing this process, since interactions between excitations drive an energy cascade from large to small scales, influencing the evolution of the distribution and magnitude of density fluctuations in real and momentum space. Motivated by these considerations, we investigate the use of density texture as a potential tool to characterize the temporal evolution of turbulence. Our experiment and simulations demonstrate this approach and include an estimate of the characteristic time for texture relaxation.</description>

      <title>Geometric potential for a Bose-Einstein condensate on a curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined on a curved surface and unravel the effects of curvatures. Starting with a general formulation for any smooth surface, we apply it to a prolate ellipsoid, which is inspired by recent bubble trap experiments. Using a perturbative approach to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and a general Ansatz, followed by a dimensional reduction, we derive an effective two-dimensional equation that includes a curvature-dependent geometric potential. We compute the ground state using Thomas-Fermi approximation and, for an isotropic confinement, we find that the highest accumulation of atoms happens on the regions with the greatest difference between the principal curvatures. For a prolate ellipsoid, this accumulation happens on the equator, which is contrary to previous findings that describe accumulation on the poles of a bubble trap. Finally, we explain the reasons for this difference: the higher accumulation of atoms on the poles happens due to anisotropies in the confinement, while the higher accumulation on the equator happens exclusively due to the geometric properties of the surface.</description>

      <title>Paired Parton Trial States for the Superfluid-Fractional Chern Insulator Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of hard-core bosons on a lattice, half-filling a Chern band such that the system has a continuous transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a superfluid state (SF) depending on the bandwidth to bandspacing ratio. We construct a parton-inspired trial wavefunction ansatz for the ground states that has remarkably high overlap with exact diagonalization in both phases and throughout the phase transition. Our ansatz is stable to adding some bosonic interactions beyond the on-site hard core constraint. We confirm that the transition is well described by a projective translation symmetry-protected multiple parton band gap closure, as has been previously predicted. However, unlike prior work, we find that our wavefunctions require anomalous (BCS-like) parton correlations to describe the phase transition and SF phase accurately.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Multi-loop and Multi-axis Atomtronic Sagnac Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained Josephson dynamics and self-trapping in supersolids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the self-sustained Josephson junction dynamics in dipolar supersolids, predicting the possibility of self-trapping alongside the experimentally observed Josephson oscillations [Biagioni, G. et al., Nature 629, 773 (2024)]. Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Hence, the associated Hamiltonian allows us to straightforwardly determine the self-trapping regime. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson junction dynamics across its full range, and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions. We further find that the off-axis droplets move in the radial direction during the evolution in accordance with the size of the central droplet. Such movements do not interfere with the model predictions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>Local vs non-local dynamics in cavity-coupled Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</description>

      <title>The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</description>
