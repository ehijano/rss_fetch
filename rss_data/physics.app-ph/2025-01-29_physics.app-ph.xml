      <title>Convection-modulated topological edge mode and extended-localized criticality in thermal metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection offers a dynamic and flexible approach to achieving a variety of novel physical phenomena beyond pure conduction. Here, we demonstrate that thermal metamaterials with convection modulation enable the realization of non-Hermitian topological edge modes and bulk mode criticality. We illustrate that a periodic modulation can induce localized edge modes within the band gap. The temperature field of the topological state is localized at the edge rings, decaying exponentially at a fixed rate. Additionally, we introduce an extended-localized criticality through the quasiperiodic convection modulation in thermotics. The convections have an advantage of fantastic tunability in the application. Our work proposes a scheme for implementing topological modes and bulk mode criticality through modulating convection in diffusion systems, paving the way for the design of reconfigurable thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Empirical modeling and hybrid machine learning framework for nucleate pool boiling on microchannel structured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-structured surfaces influence nucleation characteristics and bubble dynamics besides increasing the heat transfer surface area, thus enabling efficient nucleate boiling heat transfer. Modeling the pool boiling heat transfer characteristics of these surfaces under varied conditions is essential in diverse applications. A new empirical correlation for nucleate boiling on microchannel structured surfaces has been proposed with the data collected from various experiments in previous studies since the existing correlations are limited by their accuracy and narrow operating ranges. This study also examines various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on the microchannel structured surfaces dataset to predict the nucleate pool boiling Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC). With the aim to integrate both the ML and domain knowledge, a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Aided Framework (PIMLAF) is proposed. The proposed correlation in this study is employed as the prior physics-based model for PIMLAF, and a DNN is employed to model the residuals of the prior model. This hybrid framework achieved the best performance in comparison to the other ML models and DNNs. This framework is able to generalize well for different datasets because the proposed correlation provides the baseline knowledge of the boiling behavior. Also, SHAP interpretation analysis identifies the critical parameters impacting the model predictions and their effect on HTC prediction. This analysis further makes the model more robust and reliable.

      <title>Fixed-Frequency Reconfigurable Leaky-Wave Antennas with Simplified Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a reconfigurable leaky-waveguide antenna with a simplified biasing scheme for dynamic beam steering at a fixed frequency. Unlike prior metasurface-aided leaky-waveguide antennas that employ tunable metasurfaces as radiative apertures, our approach utilizes them as a waveguide wall solely to control the guided mode. As a result, the proposed structure eliminates the need for local biasing schemes commonly required in earlier designs, significantly simplifying the biasing process. The radiation is achieved by employing passive, angle-independent metasurfaces that allow beam steering across broadside. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design are validated through full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Temperature and Density Discontinuities for Phase-Change Heat Transfer With Non-condensable Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent prior work, the author derived interfacial mass and heat flux conditions for phase-change processes. The mass flux condition is identical to the Schrage equation, but the additional heat flux expression enables one to couple the interface to the continua in both the liquid and the vapor phases and compute the interfacial temperature and density discontinuities. However, questions exist on how to treat phase change heat transfer in the presence of non-condensable gases. In this work, the author shows that the same set of interfacial conditions can be used to account for the presence of non-condensable gases. Although the mass flux of non-condensable gas is zero, their presence impacts the heat transfer. For evaporation, when the presence of the non-condensable gas is small, temperature and density discontinuities persist across the interface, as well as inverted temperature distributions. For condensation, however, no temperature inversion happens in the presence of a small amount of non-condensable gas and the interfacial temperature jump is significantly smaller. When a large amount of non-condensable gas is present, such as for evaporation into and condensation from air, the temperature discontinuities at the interface are significantly smaller and no temperature inversion happens. For evaporation driven purely by humidity difference, temperature inversion and discontinuity still exist. Results from this work will benefit the modeling of phase change processes in the presence of non-condensable gases, evaporative cooling in air, air-gap distillation, atmospheric water harvesting, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Recording Architecture for Three-Dimensional Magnetic Recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic recording (3DMR) is a highly promising approach to achieving ultra-large data storage capacity in hard disk drives. One of the greatest challenges for 3DMR lies in performing sequential and correct writing of bits into the multi-layer recording medium. In this work, we have proposed a hierarchical recording architecture based on layered heat-assisted writing with a multi-head array. The feasibility of the architecture is validated in a dual-layer 3DMR system with FePt-based thin films via micromagnetic simulation. Our results reveal the magnetization reversal mechanism of the grains, ultimately attaining appreciable switching probability and medium signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each layer. In particular, an optimal head-to-head distance is identified as the one that maximizes the medium SNR. Optimizing the system's noise resistance will improve the overall SNR and allow for a smaller optimal head-to-head distance, which can pave the way for scaling 3DMR to more recording layers.</description>

      <title>Influence of Humidity on the Resistive Switching of Hexagonal Boron Nitride-Based Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional material-based memristors have recently gained attention as components of future neuromorphic computing concepts. However, their surrounding atmosphere can influence their behavior. In this work, we investigate the resistive switching behavior of hexagonal boron nitride-based memristors with active nickel electrodes under vacuum conditions. Our cells exhibit repeatable, bipolar, nonvolatile switching under voltage stress after initial forming, with a switching window &gt; 10${^3}$ under ambient conditions. However, in a vacuum, the forming is suppressed, and hence, no switching is observed. Compact model simulations can reproduce the set kinetics of our cells under ambient conditions and predict highly suppressed resistive switching in a water-deficient environment, supporting the experimental results. Our findings have important implications for the application of h-BN-based memristors with electrochemically active electrodes since semiconductor chips are typically processed under high vacuum conditions and encapsulated to protect them from atmospheric influences.</description>

      <title>Optimizing electro-optic modulators for interfacing color centers in an integrated silicon carbide platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide is a promising material platform for hosting various color centers suitable for quantum information processing. Here, we report for the first time the design and demonstration of an integrated electro-optic modulator that can directly interface the silicon vacancy centers in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform. Despite a relatively low electro-optic coefficient ($0.22$ pm/V), the optimized silicon carbide modulator is able to work in the 920 nm range with a propagation loss of less than $0.5$ dB/cm, featuring an a 3-dB bandwidth around 500 MHz, an extinction ratio of 8-12 dB for an operating peak-to-peak voltage of 10 V, and a footprint of less than $0.1\ \text{mm}^2$. With such modulation performance, our work provides a cost-effective solution for the chip-scale implementation of the electro-optic modulation technology for interfacing color centers in the silicon carbide platform.</description>

      <title>Compact, widely tunable ultrashort burst pulse generator using four mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort burst laser pulses serve as powerful tools for precise laser processing, broadband ultrafast spectroscopy, and high-speed laser-scanning microscopy. However, the performance of conventional burst pulse generators is limited by constraints in the pulse time interval variability, pulse energy variability, pulse number variability, and overall system complexity. Here, we present a compact burst pulse generator that offers a broad tuning range for pulse time intervals, along with control over the number of pulses and pulse energies within the burst. It consists of four mirrors, two of which are parallel to each other, and outputs pulses that are equally spaced both temporally and spatially. We demonstrated the generation of a burst laser pulse by shaping a single ultrashort laser pulse into six pulses with time intervals ranging from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. The pulse time intervals and energies were consistent with theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The fluid dynamics of liquid mushrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets that impact the surface of a deep liquid pool may form a vertical jet after the cavity formation event, provided they have sufficient impact energy. Depending on the associated time scales and the effect of the Rayleigh Plateau instability, this jet may either continue to rise, or may form satellite droplets via necking. Collision of these structures with a second incoming droplet, ejected from the same dispensing tip as the first droplet, may result in the formation of various lamellar patterns, depending on the impact conditions, giving rise to liquid mushroom and or umbrella structures. In this research, we experiment for the first time with hydrodynamics of such liquid mushrooms, and study the effect of droplet impact height, surface tension, and viscosity on the dynamics of such lamellar formations. We further explore the role of the orientation of incoming droplet impact, ie whether head on or offset collision with the rising jet or satellite droplet. We discuss the spatiotemporal evolution of the lamella diameters, and its susceptibility to surface tension, viscosity, and droplet impact height. We put forward a theoretical model based on energetics, to predict the maximum spread diameter of the lamellae, which yields accurate predictions with respect to our experiments. Our findings may help to provide important insights towards a fluid dynamic phenomenon observed often in nature and may be important in niche utilities as well.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulations of three-dimensional nanotube networks: Enhanced modeling using unit cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a simulation approach for three-dimensional nanotube networks using cubic and tetragonal unit cells to enhance modeling efficiency. A random-walk algorithm was developed to generate these networks, which were analyzed in a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation to assess their electrical conductivity. The percolation probability as a function of the nanotube filling factor can be derived from these simulation results. It is found that smaller tetragonal unit cells can replicate the behavior of larger networks with significantly reduced computational effort, achieving a 20 times reduction in computational time while receiving similar results. In this work, we focus on carbon-doped titanate nanotubes for hydrogen applications, but the method is adaptable for other nanocomposite applications. The findings provide a universal framework for the investigation of nanotube-based materials.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of quasisymmetric stellarators and their coil sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We augment the `QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository' (QUASR) to include vacuum field stellarators with quasihelical symmetry using a globalized optimization workflow. The database now has almost 370,000 quasisaxisymmetry and quasihelically symmetric devices along with coil sets, optimized for a variety of aspect ratios, rotational transforms, and discrete rotational symmetries. This paper outlines a couple of ways to explore and characterize the data set. We plot devices on a near-axis quasisymmetry landscape, revealing close correspondence to this predicted landscape. We also use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it can easily be visualized in two or three dimensions. Principal component analysis also gives a mechanism to compare the new devices here to previously published ones in the literature. We are able to characterize the structure of the data, observe clusters, and visualize the progression of devices in these clusters. The topology of the data is governed by the interplay of the design constraints and valleys of the quasisymmetry objective. These techniques reveal that the data has structure, and that typically one, two or three principal components are sufficient to characterize it. The latest version of QUASR is archived at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10050655 and can be explored online at quasr.flatironinstitute.org.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analog Signal Processing Platform Enabled with Acoustic Charge Transport in Two-dimensional Materials</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional Acoustic Charge Transport (2D-ACT) devices, which integrate two dimensional semiconductor field-effect transistor (FET) with high-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) device provide a potential compact platform for the processing of analog signals in a wireless, non-contact, low-loss and real-time way. It is expected to be used in long-distance space communication and sensing. However, current investigations into 2D-ACT devices are still limited to the observation of DC acoustoelectric currents, and have yet to achieve real-time electronic signal processing capabilities. In this paper, we have designed a hybrid acoustoelectric platform composed of two-dimensional semiconductor FET and SAW device. The platform is capable of processing DC signals, exhibiting ambipolar transport behavior. The sub-wavelength channel length of the FET within the platform allows for the real-time observation of carrier distribution at a microscopic scale in conjunction with the SAW potential, and facilitating the reproduction and intensity regulation of AC signals. By adjusting the relative phase and intensity ratio of two counter-propagating SAWs, the platform also enables the addition and subtraction of AC signals.</description>

      <title>Design of superparamagnetic nanoparticle-materials for high-frequency inductor cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The progress in the semiconductor industry has resulted in great demand for high-frequency magnetic materials applicable in microfabricated inductor cores. Nanocomposite materials, containing magnetic nanoparticles in a non-conducting matrix, may provide a solution for materials with high susceptibility (/permeability) and low power loss in the MHz regime, where traditional ferrites fail in performance. Here, we present a design guide for usage of magnetic nanoparticles in such materials. We use statistical mechanics methods to derive the magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles in case of uniaxial or cubic anisotropy, as function of particle size and applied field direction, and investigate shape and interaction effects on the susceptibility. Using the derived susceptibilities, with inductor-core applications in mind, we show that close-to-spherical particles of materials with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic anisotropy, such as FeNi$_3$, are optimal. Additionally, the particle size shall be optimized to be as large as possible while maintaining superparamagnetic behaviour at the relevant frequency. Based on this, we predict that high particle susceptibilities of $&gt;$700 (/$&gt;$1500) are possible for randomly oriented (/aligned) 20$\pm$1 nm diameter FeNi$_3$ particles, together with high-frequency stability, shown by low out-of-phase component at 2 MHz. This implies that materials containing nanoparticles have the potential to be tuned to outperform state-of-the-art ferrite inductor-core materials at MHz-frequencies.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes per se are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, as the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be true in 1D cases.</description>

Abstract: Simulations of the operation of fields of borehole heat exchangers involve a wide spectrum of time scales, and hourly simulations for decades are required for the evaluation of the heat transfer in the subsurface due to these systems. Most current models rely on time and space superposition of fundamental analytical solutions of the heat equation to build the solution for complex borehole fields configurations and loading conditions. These procedures are robust and accurate but do not have favorable scaling properties, and the problems can become quickly computationally intractable as the size increases. In this context, acceleration algorithms for temporal superposition are key to overcome this limitation. This paper presents developments on the so-called "non-history dependent" acceleration scheme and its application to the point and line source solutions, which are commonly used as building blocks in borehole field simulations.
  The results obtained show promising properties as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of time steps, and near double precision accuracy can be achieved by refining the discretizations used to compute the integrals arising from the scheme.</description>
