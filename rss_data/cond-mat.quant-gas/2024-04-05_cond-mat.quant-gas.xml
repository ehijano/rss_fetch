      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in a ferromagnetic superfluid: effects of axial magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An easy-plane ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas undergoes two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, associated with mass and spin superfluidity respectively. We study the effect of axial magnetization on the superfluid properties of this system. We find that nonzero axial magnetization couples mass and spin superflow, via a mechanism analogous to the Andreev-Bashkin effect present in two-component superfluids. With sufficiently large axial magnetization mass and spin superfluidity arise simultaneously. The cross-over to this phase provides a finite-temperature generalization of the zero-temperature broken-axisymmetric to easy-axis transition. We present analytic relations connecting mass and spin superfluidity with experimentally observable coherence of the three spinor components and local magnetization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases of a Dipolar Fermi Gas with Laser-assisted Interwire Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate unconventional superfluid phases of fermionic dipolar particles lying in a double-wire setup with laser-assisted interwire tunneling. Our numerical simulations, based on the nonlocal Kohn-Sham Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, reveal the existence of a large Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) region with a stripe phase under an imbalance of particle densities between two wires. When the laser-assisted interwire tunneling is present, it induces a transition from the FFLO phase to the topological superfluid phase and the associated Majorana zero modes exhibit an oscillation structure, which is significantly enhanced by the long-range nature of the interwire dipolar interaction. This distinguishes itself from the results obtained with usual contact interaction and offers new opportunities for manipulating and reshaping Majorana zero modes by adjusting the degree of the nonlocality and the interwire separation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced mobility of quantum droplets in periodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict that one- and two-dimensional self-bound quantum droplets, forming in Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum corrections to the mean-field energy, may demonstrate exceptional mobility in periodic optical lattices and that they may exhibit considerable displacements across the lattice, remaining dynamically stable, even under weak initial phase kicks imparted to them. Mobility properties of quantum droplets are determined by their internal structure and strongly depend on the number of particles in them. We find that due to the peculiar effect of the LHY quantum corrections, odd (i.e., on-site centered) and even (i.e., intersite-centered) one-dimensional quantum droplets feature alternating mobility and immobility bands closely corresponding to the regions, where translational perturbation mode is unstable and stable, respectively. This picture becomes even richer in two-dimensional case, where odd-odd, even-odd or even-even quantum droplets also feature alternating mobility and immobility domains, and where, surprisingly, the droplet may be mobile in one direction, but immobile in the orthogonal direction. We link changes in mobility properties with multiple intersections of energy $E(\mu)$ and norm $N(\mu)$ dependencies for droplets with different internal structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum slush state in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an exotic quantum state which does not order at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a disorder-free system. At zero temperature, this model exhibits a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. This state, dubbed quantum slush state, features a quasi-long-range order with an algebraic decay for its correlation function, and is different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>High fidelity control of a many-body Tonks--Girardeau gas with an effective mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are powerful tools that can be used to control quantum systems with high fidelity. They work particularly well for single particle and non-interacting systems which can be described exactly and which possess invariant or self-similar dynamics. However, finding an exact STA for strongly correlated many-body systems can be difficult, as their complex dynamics may not be easily described, especially for larger systems that do not possess self-similar solutions. Here, we design STAs for one-dimensional bosonic gas in the Tonks--Girardeau limit by using a mean-field approach that succinctly captures the strong interaction effects through a quintic nonlinear term in the Schr\"odinger equation. We show that for the case of the harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent trap frequency the mean-field approach works exactly and recovers the well-known STA from literature. To highlight the robustness of our approach we also show that it works effectively for anharmonic potentials, achieving higher fidelities than other typical control techniques.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>
