      <title>Ultra-Low-Power Spiking Neurons in 7 nm FinFET Technology: A Comparative Analysis of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, Morris-Lecar, and Axon-Hillock Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's remarkable energy efficiency and parallel processing capabilities for large-scale artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of three spiking neuron circuit architectures-Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH)-implemented in a 7 nm FinFET technology. Through extensive SPICE simulations, we explore the optimization of spiking frequency, energy per spike, and static power consumption. Our results show that the AH design achieves the highest throughput, demonstrating multi-gigahertz firing rates (up to 3 GHz) with attojoule energy costs. By contrast, the ML architecture excels in subthreshold to near-threshold regimes, offering robust low-power operation (as low as 0.385 aJ/spike) and biological bursting behavior. Although LIF benefits from a decoupled current mirror for high-frequency operation, it exhibits slightly higher static leakage compared to ML and AH at elevated supply voltages. Comparisons with previous node implementations (22 nm planar, 28 nm) reveal that 7 nm FinFETs can drastically boost energy efficiency and speed albeit at the cost of increased subthreshold leakage in deep subthreshold regions. By quantifying design trade-offs for each neuron architecture, our work provides a roadmap for optimizing spiking neuron circuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to deliver neuromorphic hardware capable of both ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.</description>

      <title>Izhikevich-Inspired Temporal Dynamics for Enhancing Privacy, Efficiency, and Transferability in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit diverse temporal spike patterns, which are believed to support efficient, robust, and adaptive neural information processing. While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.</description>

      <title>A New Scope and Domain Measure Comparison Method for Global Convergence Analysis in Evolutionary Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence analysis is a fundamental research topic in evolutionary computation (EC). The commonly used analysis method models the EC algorithm as a homogeneous Markov chain for analysis, which is not always suitable for different EC variants, and also sometimes causes misuse and confusion due to their complex process. In this article, we categorize the existing researches on convergence analysis in EC algorithms into stable convergence and global convergence, and then prove that the conditions for these two convergence properties are somehow mutually exclusive. Inspired by this proof, we propose a new scope and domain measure comparison (SDMC) method for analyzing the global convergence of EC algorithms and provide a rigorous proof of its necessity and sufficiency as an alternative condition. Unlike traditional methods, the SDMC method is straightforward, bypasses Markov chain modeling, and minimizes errors from misapplication as it only focuses on the measure of the algorithm's search scope. We apply SDMC to two algorithm types that are unsuitable for traditional methods, confirming its effectiveness in global convergence analysis. Furthermore, we apply the SDMC method to explore the gene targeting mechanism's impact on the global convergence in large-scale global optimization, deriving insights into how to design EC algorithms that guarantee global convergence and exploring how theoretical analysis can guide EC algorithm design.</description>

      <title>TS-SNN: Temporal Shift Module for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04165v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Call for Action: towards the next generation of symbolic regression benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering interpretable mathematical expressions. However, benchmarking SR methods remains challenging due to the diversity of algorithms, datasets, and evaluation criteria. In this work, we present an updated version of SRBench. Our benchmark expands the previous one by nearly doubling the number of evaluated methods, refining evaluation metrics, and using improved visualizations of the results to understand the performances. Additionally, we analyze trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and energy consumption. Our results show that no single algorithm dominates across all datasets. We propose a call for action from SR community in maintaining and evolving SRBench as a living benchmark that reflects the state-of-the-art in symbolic regression, by standardizing hyperparameter tuning, execution constraints, and computational resource allocation. We also propose deprecation criteria to maintain the benchmark's relevance and discuss best practices for improving SR algorithms, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning and energy-efficient implementations.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.</description>

      <title>TrajEvo: Designing Trajectory Prediction Heuristics via LLM-driven Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Algorithms Are Significantly More Robust to Noise When They Ignore It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized search heuristics (RSHs) are known to have a certain robustness to noise. Mathematical analyses trying to quantify rigorously how robust RSHs are to a noisy access to the objective function typically assume that each solution is re-evaluated whenever it is compared to others. This aims at preventing that a single noisy evaluation has a lasting negative effect, but is computationally expensive and requires the user to foresee that noise is present (as in a noise-free setting, one would never re-evaluate solutions).
  In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of an evolutionary algorithm solving a single-objective noisy problem without re-evaluations. We prove that the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm without re-evaluations can optimize the classic LeadingOnes benchmark with up to constant noise rates, in sharp contrast to the version with re-evaluations, where only noise with rates $O(n^{-2} \log n)$ can be tolerated. This result suggests that re-evaluations are much less needed than what was previously thought, and that they actually can be highly detrimental. The insights from our mathematical proofs indicate that this similar results are plausible for other classic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HM-DF SNN: Transcending Conventional Online Learning with Advanced Training and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. Compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training methods, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion. However, current online learning framework cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Hybrid Mechanism-Driven Firing (HM-DF) model, which is a family of advanced models that respectively adopt different spiking calculation schemes in the upper-region and lower-region of the firing threshold. We point out that HM-DF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and tackle the mismatch problem of surrogate gradients, as well as achieving full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that HM-DF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the field of online learning, without triggering further power consumption.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Abstract Rules in Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of abstract rules from exemplars is a cornerstone of genuine intelligence in both biological and artificial systems. However, the internal organizational principles underlying different abstract rules remain poorly understood. We propose a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN), inspired by astrocyte signaling. The model globally configures and locally fine-tunes intrinsic neuronal properties via a two-stage neuromodulatory mechanism. This design enhances neuronal adaptability and diversity, thus enabling fine-grained analysis of internal organizational principles. We evaluate abstract rule emergence across four cognitive task sets. To probe internal organization, we examine network-level connectivity via structural modularity analysis and neuron-level functional biases via bin-wise lesion studies based on intrinsic properties. Our experiments show that HM-RSNN successfully achieves abstract rule emergence, with rule-contingent organizational principles evident at both network and neuron levels. These findings highlight the critical role of dynamic internal organization in supporting flexible cognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve complex new learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition Applied to Sustainability Data Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.</description>
