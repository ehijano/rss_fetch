      <title>Behind the mirror: the hidden dissipative singular solutions of ideal reversible fluids on log-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical observations show that turbulence exhibits a broad range of scaling exponents, characterizing how the velocity gradients diverge in the inviscid limit. These exponents are thought to be linked to singular solutions of the Euler equations. In this work, we propose a dynamic approach to construct concept of these solutions directly from the fluid equations, using a reversible framework and introducing the efficiency $\cal{E}$, a non-dimensional number that quantifies the amount of energy stored within the flow due to an applied force. To circumvent the computational burden of tracking singularities at finer and finer scale, we test this approach on fluids on log-lattices, which allow for high effective resolutions at a moderate cost, while preserving the same symmetries and global conservation laws as ordinary fluids. We observe a phase transition at a given efficiency, separating regular, viscous solutions (hydrodynamic phase), from singular, inviscid solutions (singular phase). The singular solutions experience self-similar blow-ups with exponents corresponding to non-dissipative solutions. By applying a stochastic regularization, we are able to go past the blow-up, and show that the resulting solutions converge to power-law solutions with exponents characterizing dissipative solutions. Overall, the range of scaling exponents observed for log-lattice solutions is comparable to those of ordinary fluids.</description>

      <title>The Perturbation Theory Approach to Stability in the Scattered Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattered disk objects (SDOs) are distant minor bodies that orbit the sun on highly eccentric orbits, frequently with perhelia near Neptune's orbit. Gravitational perturbations due to Neptune frequently lead to chaotic dynamics, with the degree of chaotic diffusion set by an object's perihelion distance. Batygin et al. (2021) developed a perturbative approach for scattered disk dynamics, finding that, to leading order in semi-major axis ratio, an infinite series of $2:j$ resonances drives the dynamics of the distant scattered disk, with overlaps between resonances driving chaotic motion. In this work we extend this model by taking the spherical harmonic expansion for Neptune's gravitational potential to octupole order and beyond. In continuing the expansion out to smaller semi-major axis limits, we find that the $1:j$ and $3:j$ resonances that emerge in the octupole expansion do not individually set new limits on the stability boundary. Instead, we find that for increasingly Neptune-proximate orbits, resonances of progressively higher index are dominant in explaining the emergence of chaotic behavior. In this picture, the mutual intersections between series of $2:j$, $3:j$, $4:j \dots,$ resonant chains explain local chaotic evolution of SDOs and shape the dynamical distribution of the population at large.</description>

      <title>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.</description>

      <title>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>
