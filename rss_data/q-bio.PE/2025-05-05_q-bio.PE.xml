      <title>Spatial modeling of forest-savanna bistability: Impacts of fire dynamics and timescale separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest-savanna bistability - the hypothesis that forests and savannas exist as alternative stable states in the tropics - and its implications are key challenges for mathematical modelers and ecologists in the context of ongoing climate change. To generate new insights into this problem, we present a spatial Markov jump process model of savanna forest fires that integrates key ecological processes, including seed dispersal, fire spread, and non-linear vegetation flammability. In contrast to many models of forest-savanna bistability, we explicitly model both fire dynamics and vegetation regrowth in a mathematically tractable framework. This approach bridges the gap between slow-timescale vegetation models and highly resolved fire dynamics, shedding light on the influence of short-term and transient processes on vegetation cover. In our spatial stochastic model, bistability arises from periodic fires that maintain low forest cover, whereas dense forest areas inhibit fire spread and preserve high tree density. The deterministic mean-field approximation of the model similarly predicts bistability, but deviates quantitatively from the fully spatial model, especially in terms of its transient dynamics. These results also underscore the critical role of timescale separation between fire and vegetation processes in shaping ecosystem structure and resilience.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating growth rates link turnover and unevenness in species-rich communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maintenance of diversity, the `commonness of rarity', and compositional turnover are ubiquitous features of species-rich communities. Through a stylized model, we consider how these features reflect the interplay between environmental stochasticity, intra- and interspecific competition, and dispersal. We show that, even when species have the same time-average fitness, fitness fluctuations tend to drive the community towards ever-growing unevenness and species extinctions, but self-limitation and/or dispersal allow high-diversity states to be sustained. We then analyze the species-abundance distribution and the abundance distribution of individual species over time in such high-diversity states. Their shapes vary predictably along two axes -- Exclusion-Stabilization and Exclusion-Buffering -- that describe the relative strength of the underlying ecological processes. Predicted shapes cover different empirically observed cases, notably power-law and unimodal distributions. An effective focal-species model allows us to relate static abundance distributions with turnover dynamics, also when species have different mean fitness. The model suggests how community statistics and time series of individual species can inform on the relative importance of the ecological processes that structure diversity.</description>

      <title>From random walks to epidemic spreading: Compartment model with mortality for vector transmitted diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for vector-transmitted diseases, such as Malaria and Dengue, spreading over complex networks. Individuals are represented by independent random walkers and vectors by infected nodes. Both walkers and nodes can be susceptible (S) or infected (I). Infected walkers may die (entering the dead compartment D), while infected nodes remain alive. Susceptible walkers can be infected by visiting infected nodes, and susceptible nodes by visits from infected walkers. We derive explicit expressions for the basic reproduction numbers $R_0$ (without mortality) and $R_M$ (with mortality), proving that $R_M &lt; R_0$. When $R_M , R_0 &gt; 1$, the healthy state is unstable, and for zero mortality, an endemic equilibrium emerges. We also study the effects of confinement measures. Simulations align well with mean-field predictions on strongly connected graphs but deviate for weakly connected networks. Our model has various interdisciplinary applications which include the modeling of chemical reaction kinetics, contaminant spread, and wildfire propagation.</description>

      <title>Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.</description>
