      <title>Dust populations from 30 to 1000 au in the debris disk of HD 120326</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. To date, more than a hundred debris disks have been spatially resolved. Among them, the young system HD 120326 stands out, displaying different disk substructures on both intermediate (30-150 au) and large (150-1000 au) scales. Aims. We present new VLT/SPHERE (1.0-1.8 $\mu$m) and ALMA (1.3 mm) data of the debris disk around HD 120326. By combining them with archival HST/STIS (0.2-1.0 $\mu$m) and archival SPHERE data, we have been able to examine the morphology and photometry of the debris disk, along with its dust properties. Methods. We present the open-access code MoDiSc (Modeling Disks in Scattered light) to model the inner belt jointly using the SPHERE polarized and total intensity observations. Separately, we modeled the ALMA data and the spectral energy distribution (SED). We combined the results of both these analyses with the STIS data to determine the global architecture of HD 120326. Results. For the inner belt, identified as a planetesimal belt, we derived a semi-major axis of 43 au, fractional luminosity of 1.8 x 10-3 , and maximum degree of polarization of 45-57 % at 1.6 $\mu$m. The spectral slope of its reflectance spectrum is red between 1.0 and 1.3 $\mu$m and gray between 1.3 and 1.8 $\mu$m. Additionally, the SPHERE data show that there could be a halo of small particles or a second belt at distances &lt;150 au. Using ALMA, we derived in the continuum (1.3 mm) an integrated flux of 541-581 $\mu$Jy. We did not detect any 12CO emission. At larger separations (&gt;150 au), we highlight a spiral-like feature spanning hundreds of astronomical units in the STIS data. Conclusions. Further data are needed to confirm and better constrain the dust properties and global morphology of HD 120326.</description>

      <title>Logos-Zoe: A contact binary triple system in the trans-neptunian belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trans-neptunian object (58534) 1997 CQ$_{29}$ (a.k.a. Logos) is a resolved wide binary in the dynamically Cold Classical population. With Hubble Space Telescope resolved observations where the primary Logos is well separated from its secondary Zoe it can be established that Logos has a time-variable brightness. Logos' brightness varied by several tenths of a magnitude over a short timescale of hours while the brightness variability of Zoe was on a longer timescale. New unresolved ground-based observations obtained with the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the Magellan-Baade telescope confirm at least one highly variable component in this system. With our ground-based observations and photometric constraints from space-based observations, we suggest that the primary Logos is likely a close/contact binary whose rotational period is 17.43$\pm$0.06 h for a lightcurve amplitude of 0.70$\pm$0.07 mag while Zoe is potentially a (very) slow rotator with an unknown shape. Using the Candela software, we model the Logos-Zoe system and predict its upcoming mutual events season using rotational, physical, and mutual orbit parameters derived in this work or already published. Zoe's shape and rotational period are still uncertain, so we consider various options to better understand Zoe. The upcoming mutual event season for Logos-Zoe starts in 2026 and will last for four years with up to two events per year. Observations of these mutual events will allow us to significantly improve the physical and rotational properties of both Logos and Zoe.</description>

      <title>Stringent Limits on H$_3^+$ Emission from the Hot Jupiters WASP-80b and WASP-69b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of auroras on exoplanets would provide numerous insights into planet-star systems, including potential detections of the planetary magnetic fields, constraints on host-star wind properties, and information on the thermal structures of planets. However, there have not yet been any discoveries of auroras on exoplanets. In this paper, we focus on the search for infrared auroral emission from the molecular ion H$_3^+$, which is common in the atmospheres of solar system planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Using Keck/NIRSPEC high-resolution spectroscopy, we search for H$_3^+$ emission from two hot Jupiters, WASP-80b and WASP-69b. We do not see any evidence of emission in the observed spectra when cross-correlating with an H$_3^+$ spectral model or when using an auto-correlation approach to search for any significant features. We therefore place upper limits on the total emission of $5.32 \times 10^{18}$ W for WASP-80b and $1.64 \times 10^{19}$ W for WASP-69b. These upper limits represent the most stringent limits to date and approach the regime of emission suspected from theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Lunar impact ejecta flux on the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer of material between planetary bodies due to impact events is important for understanding planetary evolution, meteoroid impact fluxes, the formation of near-Earth objects (NEOs), and even the provenance of volatile and organic materials at Earth. This study investigates the dynamics and fate of lunar ejecta reaching Earth. We employ the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator withing the REBOUND package to track for 100,000 years the trajectories of 6,000 test particles launched from various lunar latitudes and longitudes. Our model incorporates a realistic velocity distribution for ejecta fragments (tens of meters in size), derived form large lunar cratering events. Our results show that 22.6% of lunar ejecta collide with Earth, following a power-law $C(t) \propto t^{0.315}$ with half of the impacts occurring within ~10,000 years. We also confirm that impact events on the Moon's trailing hemisphere serve as a dominant source of Earth-bound ejecta, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, a small fraction of ejecta remains transiently in near-Earth space, providing evidence that lunar ejecta may contribute to the NEO population. This aligns with recent discoveries of Earth co-orbitals such as Kamo'oalewa (469219, 2016 HO3) and 2024 PT5, both exhibiting spectral properties consistent with lunar material. These findings enhance our understanding of the lunar ejecta flux to Earth, providing insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of this flux and its broader influence on the near-Earth environment.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits to the Proper Motions of JuMBO 24, a Jupiter-Mass Binary Object Candidate in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.</description>

      <title>Estimates of Rotation Periods for Jupiter Trojans with the Zwicky Transient Facility Photometric Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new rotational period estimates for 216 Jupiter Trojans using photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), including 80 Trojans with previously unknown periods. Our analysis reveals rotation periods ranging from 4.6 hours to 447.8 hours. These results support the existence of a spin barrier for Trojans larger than 10 km, with periods clustering between 4 and 4.8 hours. This spin barrier is roughly twice as long as that observed for main-belt asteroids, suggesting that Jupiter Trojans have significantly lower bulk densities, likely due to a higher fraction of ices and volatile materials in their composition. We identify three new Trojans with reliable rotation periods near the spin barrier, doubling the number of known Trojans in this critical period range. Using these results, we estimate a mean density of approximately 0.52 g/cm^3 for rubble-pile Trojans. Our findings support the growing evidence that many Trojans are rubble-pile bodies with distinct physical properties compared to main-belt asteroids. Looking forward, we anticipate that data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide rotational period estimates for several hundred thousand Trojans, down to objects as small as 1 km, enabling a more detailed investigation of their rotational properties and internal structure.</description>

      <title>Retrieving day- and nightside atmospheric properties of the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-2109b. Detection of Fe and CO emission lines and evidence for inefficient heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) TOI-2109b marks the lower edge of the equilibrium temperature gap between 3500 K and 4500 K, an unexplored thermal regime that separates KELT-9b, the hottest planet yet discovered, from all other currently known gas giants. To study the structure of TOI-2109b's atmosphere, we obtained high-resolution emission spectra of both the planetary day- and nightsides with CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$. By applying the cross-correlation technique, we identified the emission signatures of Fe I and CO, as well as a thermal inversion layer in the dayside atmosphere; no significant H$_2$O signal was detected from the dayside. None of the analyzed species were detectable from the nightside atmosphere. We applied a Bayesian retrieval framework that combines high-resolution spectroscopy with photometric measurements to constrain the dayside atmospheric parameters and derive upper limits for the nightside hemisphere. The dayside thermal inversion extends from 3200 K to 4600 K, with an atmospheric metallicity consistent with that of the host star (0.36 dex). Only weak constraints could be placed on the C/O ratio ($&gt;$ 0.15). The retrieved spectral line broadening is consistent with tidally locked rotation, indicating the absence of strong dynamical processes. An upper temperature limit of 2400 K and a maximum atmospheric temperature gradient of 700 K/log bar could be derived for the nightside. Comparison of the retrieved dayside T-p profile with theoretical models, the absence of strong atmospheric dynamics, and significant differences in the thermal constraints between the day- and nightside hemispheres suggest a limited heat transport efficiency across the planetary atmosphere. Overall, our results place TOI-2109b in a transitional regime between the UHJs below the thermal gap, which show both CO and H$_2$O emission lines, and KELT-9b, where molecular features are largely absent.</description>

      <title>Are there Spectral Features in the MIRI/LRS Transmission Spectrum of K2-18b?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the composition of an exoplanet atmosphere relies on the presence of detectable spectral features. The strongest spectral features, including DMS, look approximately Gaussian. Here, I perform a suite of Gaussian feature analyses to find any statistically significant spectral features in the recently published MIRI/LRS spectrum of K2-18b (N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025). In N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025, they claim a 3.4-$\sigma$ detection of spectral features compared to a flat line. In 5 out of 6 tests, I find the data preferred a flat line over a Gaussian model, with a $\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ of 1.06. When centering the Gaussian where the absorptions for DMS and DMDS peak, I find ln(B) = 1.21 in favour of the Gaussian model, with a $\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ of 0.99. With only $\sim$2-$\sigma$ in favour of Gaussian features, I conclude no strong statistical evidence for spectral features.</description>

      <title>The effects of transport processes on the bulk composition of the first generation of planetesimals interior to the water iceline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CHNOS elemental budgets of rocky planets are crucial for their structure, evolution and potential chemical habitability. It is unclear how the nonlocal disk processes affecting dust in planet-forming disks affect the CHNOS elemental budgets of nascent planets both inside and outside the Solar System. We aim to quantify the coupled effect of dynamical and collisional processes on the initial refractory CHNOS budgets of planetesimals, forming interior to the water ice line for a Solar and non-Solar composition consistent with the star HIP 43393. Methods. We utilize the SHAMPOO code to track the effects of dynamical and collisional processes on 16000 individual dust monomers. Each monomer is here assigned a refractory chemical composition and mineralogy informed by the equilibrium condensation code GGCHEM given the P-T conditions at the initial position of the monomer. Monomers travel embedded in aggregates through a young class I disk, whose structure is calculated with the ProDiMo code. Furthermore, monomers are allowed to undergo dehydration and desulfurization. We find that solid material becomes well-mixed both radially and vertically. For both the Solar and HIP43393 compositions, the solid phase in the disk midplane regions interior to r~0.7AU can become enriched in hydrogen and sulfur by up to 10at% relative to predictions from purely local calculations. This originates from the inward radial transport of hydrated and sulfur-bearing minerals such as lizardite and iron sulfide. Nonlocal disk processing in a young turbulent, massive disk can lead to significant compositional homogenization of the midplane dust and by extension of the initial composition of planetesimals. Planetesimals forming at r&lt;0.7AU may become enriched in hydrated minerals and sulfur, which could result in more widespread aqueous alteration interior to the water iceline compared to planetesimals that emerge...</description>

      <title>A Mission to Demonstrate Rapid-Response Flyby Reconnaissance for Planetary Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: International and U.S. strategies and protocols have identified the need to develop rapid-response spacecraft reconnaissance capabilities as a priority to advance planetary defense readiness. A space-based reconnaissance response is recommended for potential impactors as small as 50 m, making these small objects the most likely to trigger a space-based response and the ones that drive the reconnaissance capabilities needed. Even following the successful completion of the NEO Surveyor mission and Rubin Observatory survey efforts, roughly half of the 50-m near-Earth object (NEO) population will remain undiscovered. As a result, 50-m impactors may not be found with long warning times, and a rapid-response flyby mission may be the only reconnaissance possible. To develop a robust flyby reconnaissance capability for planetary defense, four major requirements are defined for a demonstration mission. 1. Enable a flyby of greater than 90 percent of the potential asteroid threat population. 2. Demonstrate the flyby reconnaissance for a 50 m NEO. 3. Obtain the information needed to determine if and where it would impact the Earth. 4. Determine key properties of the asteroid to inform decision makers. As commonly noted in the planetary defense community, in planetary defense, you do not pick the asteroid, the asteroid picks you. Thus, a planetary defense flyby reconnaissance demonstration mission is not about just flying by an asteroid, but rather it is about developing a robust capability for the objects that are most likely to require a short-warning-time, space-based response.</description>

      <title>Plasma Mechanism of Radio Emission Generation at the Bow Shock of the Exoplanet HD 189733b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the possibility of efficient radio emission generation in the bow shock region of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets. As a source of energetic electrons, the shock drift acceleration mechanism at a quasi-perpendicular shock is proposed. Electrons reflected and accelerated by the shock propagate through the relatively dense stellar wind plasma and excite plasma waves; therefore, a plasma emission mechanism is considered as the source of the resulting radio waves. Using the bow shock of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b as a case study, the properties of the energetic electron beam, the excited plasma waves, and the resulting radio frequencies are estimated. An energy-based analysis is carried out to identify the range of stellar wind parameters for which radio emission from the bow shock of the exoplanet HD 189733b could be detectable by modern astronomical instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets and disc winds play an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs and the formation of planetary systems. However, there is still a lack of observational data regarding the presence and parameters of outflows, especially for close young binaries. In this study, we aim to find the HH flow near the young sub-arcsecond binary DF Tau and explore its morphology. Narrow-band H$\alpha$ and H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m imaging and spectroscopic observations of DF Tau and its vicinity were performed. We have discovered several emission nebulae near the binary, which likely result from the interaction of gas outflow from the binary components with the surrounding medium. The outflow appears to occur both in the form of jets, generating numerous Herbig-Haro objects (HH 1266 flow), and as a weakly collimated wind responsible for the formation of the ring-like nebula around the binary and the rim of the cometary globule. We have found that the angle between the jet and the counter-jet is $168^\circ$ and discuss the complex morphology of the HH flow.</description>

      <title>Measuring the degree of clustering and diffusion of trans-Neptunian objects</title>

Abstract: The outer solar system is populated by a broad aggregate of minor bodies, which occupy orbits whose dynamical character ranges from long-term stable to rapidly diffusive. We investigate the chaotic properties of known distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) by numerically integrating TNO clones and statistically analyzing their orbital diffusion. Comparing the measured diffusion with an analytical criterion yields a dynamically motivated separation into classes of stable, metastable and unstable objects. We then measure the level of clustering of the longitudes of perihelia and of the orbital poles, as functions of orbital distance and of their stability properties. Distant (meta)stable objects appear increasingly clustered in perihelion around $\varpi \sim 50^\circ$ for increasing semi-major axis, while the orbits of unstable objects are well described by two, roughly equally-populated groups of "clustered" and "anti-clustered" objects, with means around $\sim 25^\circ$ and $\sim 205^\circ$ respectively. We further find that, compared to the solar system's total angular momentum vector, the mean orbital poles of distant TNOs are significantly more misaligned for (meta)stable objects, while they remain roughly aligned for unstable objects. TNOs with intermediate orbital periods also appear to be misaligned with respect to the forced plane predicted by secular theory with the known planets. This gradation based on stability, if validated further by the upcoming VRO survey, necessitates a dynamical explanation.</description>

      <title>Dust Clumping in Outer Protoplanetary Disks: the Interplay Among Four Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust concentration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is the first step towards planetesimal formation, a crucial yet highly uncertain stage in planet formation. Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a powerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive to the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave instability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh refinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and accommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas dynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust strongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated with small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is observed, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI, and those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction of such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution, and has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition, we find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain parts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary destruction of dust clumps.</description>

      <title>Perihelion precession in non-Newtonian central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.</description>
