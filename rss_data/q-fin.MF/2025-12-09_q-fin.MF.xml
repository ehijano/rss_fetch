      <title>Market Reactions to Material Cybersecurity Incident Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines short-term market responses to material cybersecurity incidents disclosed under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K. Drawing on a sample of disclosures made between 2023 and 2025, daily stock price movements were evaluated over a standardized event window surrounding each filing. On average, companies experienced negative price reactions following the disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident. Comparisons across company characteristics indicate that smaller companies tended to incur more pronounced declines, while differences by sector and beta were not evident. These findings offer empirical insight into how public markets interpret cybersecurity risks when they are formally reported and suggest that firm size may influence the degree of sensitivity to such events.</description>

      <title>Asian option valuation under price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the valuation of Asian options in a binomial market with permanent price impact, extending the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein framework under a modified risk-neutral probability. We obtain an exact pathwise representation for geometric Asian options and derive two-sided bounds for arithmetic Asian options. Our analysis identifies the no-arbitrage region in terms of hedging volumes and shows that permanent price impact systematically raises Asian option prices. Numerical examples illustrate the effect of the impact parameter and hedging volumes on the resulting prices.</description>

      <title>On the structure of increasing profits in a 1D general diffusion market with interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a financial market model consisting of a risky asset, modeled as a general diffusion parameterized by a scale function and a speed measure, and a bank account process with a constant interest rate. This flexible class of financial market models allows for features such as reflecting boundaries, skewness effects, sticky points, and slowdowns on fractal sets. For this market model, we study the structure of a strong form of arbitrage opportunity called increasing profits. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the existence of increasing profits in terms of an auxiliary deterministic signed measure $\nu$ and a canonical trading strategy $\theta$, both of which depend only on the deterministic parametric characteristics of our model, namely the scale function, the speed measure, and the interest rate. More precisely, we show that an increasing profit exists if and only if $\nu$ is nontrivial, and that this is equivalent to $\theta$ itself generating an increasing profit. Second, we provide a precise characterization of the entire set of increasing profits in terms of $\nu$ and $\theta$, and moreover characterize the value processes associated with increasing profits. Finally, we establish novel connections between no-arbitrage theory and the general theory of stochastic processes. Specifically, we relate the failure of the representation property for general diffusions to the existence of certain types of increasing profits whose value processes are dominated by the quadratic variation measure of a space-transformed version of the asset price process.</description>

      <title>Formal State-Machine Models for Uniswap v3 Concentrated-Liquidity AMMs: Priced Timed Automata, Finite-State Transducers, and Provable Rounding Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrated-liquidity automated market makers (CLAMMs), as exemplified by Uniswap v3, are now a common primitive in decentralized finance frameworks. Their design combines continuous trading on constant-function curves with discrete tick boundaries at which liquidity positions change and rounding effects accumulate. While there is a body of economic and game-theoretic analysis of CLAMMs, there is negligible work that treats Uniswap v3 at the level of formal state machines amenable to model checking or theorem proving.
  In this paper we propose a formal modeling approach for Uniswap v3-style CLAMMs using (i) networks of priced timed automata (PTA), and (ii) finite-state transducers (FST) over discrete ticks. Positions are treated as stateful objects that transition only when the pool price crosses the ticks that bound their active range. We show how to encode the piecewise constant-product invariant, fee-growth variables, and tick-crossing rules in a PTA suitable for tools such as UPPAAL, and how to derive a tick-level FST abstraction for specification in TLA+.
  We define an explicit tick-wise invariant for a discretized, single-tick CLAMM model and prove that it is preserved up to a tight additive rounding bound under fee-free swaps. This provides a formal justification for the "$\epsilon$-slack" used in invariance properties and shows how rounding enters as a controlled perturbation. We then instantiate these models in TLA+ and use TLC to exhaustively check the resulting invariants on structurally faithful instances, including a three-tick concentrated-liquidity configuration and a bounded no-rounding-only-arbitrage property in a bidirectional single-tick model. We discuss how these constructions lift to the tick-wise structure of Uniswap v3 via virtual reserves, and how the resulting properties can be phrased as PTA/TLA+ invariants about cross-tick behaviour and rounding safety.</description>

      <title>Amortizing Perpetual Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce amortizing perpetual options (AmPOs), a fungible variant of continuous-installment options suitable for exchange-based trading. Traditional installment options lapse when holders cease their payments, destroying fungibility across units of notional. AmPOs replace explicit installment payments and the need for lapsing logic with an implicit payment scheme via a deterministic decay in the claimable notional. This amortization ensures all units evolve identically, preserving fungibility. Under the Black-Scholes framework, AmPO valuation can be reduced to an equivalent vanilla perpetual American option on a dividend-paying asset. In this way, analytical expressions are possible for the exercise boundaries and risk-neutral valuations for calls and puts. These formulas and relations allow us to derive the Greeks and study comparative statics with respect to the amortization rate. Illustrative numerical case studies demonstrate how the amortization rate shapes option behavior and reveal the resulting tradeoffs in the effective volatility sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Long memory score-driven models as approximations for rough Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the continuous-time limit of score-driven models with long memory. By extending score-driven models to incorporate infinite-lag structures with coefficients exhibiting heavy-tailed decay, we establish their weak convergence, under appropriate scaling, to fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with Hurst parameter $H &lt; 1/2$. When score-driven models are used to characterize the dynamics of volatility, they serve as discrete-time approximations for rough volatility. We present several examples, including EGARCH($\infty$) whose limits give rise to a new class of rough volatility models. Building on this framework, we carry out numerical simulations and option pricing analyses, offering new tools for rough volatility modeling and simulation.</description>
