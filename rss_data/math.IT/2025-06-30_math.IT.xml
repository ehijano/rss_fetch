      <title>Multi-IRS Aided ISAC System: Multi-Path Exploitation Versus Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where multiple IRSs are strategically deployed not only to assist the communication from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to a multi-antenna communication user (CU), but also enable the sensing service for a point target in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region of the BS. First, we propose a hybrid multi-IRS architecture, which consists of several passive IRSs and one semi-passive IRS equipped with both active sensors and reflecting elements. To be specific, the active sensors are exploited to receive the echo signals for estimating the target's angle information, and the multiple reflecting paths provided by multi-IRS are employed to improve the degree of freedoms (DoFs) of communication. Under the given budget on the number of total IRSs elements, we theoretically show that increasing the number of deployed IRSs is beneficial for improving DoFs of spatial multiplexing for communication while increasing the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of target estimation, which unveils a fundamental tradeoff between the sensing and communication performance. To characterize the rate-CRB tradeoff, we study a rate maximization problem, by optimizing the BS transmit covariance matrix, IRSs phase-shifts, and the number of deployed IRSs, subject to a maximum CRB constraint. Analytical results reveal that the communication-oriented design becomes optimal when the total number of IRSs elements exceeds a certain threshold, wherein the relationships of the rate and CRB with the number of IRS elements/sensors, transmit power, and the number of deployed IRSs are theoretically derived and demystified. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the superiority of our proposed designs over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Massive MIMO: A Cost-Efficient Technique for Uniform Service in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) has evolved along two tracks: cellular and cell-free, each with unique advantages and limitations. The cellular approach suffers from worse user spectral efficiency at cell edges, whereas the cell-free approach incurs high implementation costs due to a large-scale distributed infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel networking paradigm, termed heterogeneous massive MIMO (HmMIMO), which seamlessly integrates co-located and distributed antennas. Differing from two conventional paradigms, HmMIMO remains a base station with a large antenna array at the center of each cell, aided by distributed antennas deployed at cell edges. Our findings demonstrate that this paradigm achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and implementation complexity.</description>

      <title>The Condition Number in Phase Retrieval from Intensity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of phase retrieval by analyzing the condition number of the nonlinear map $\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \bigl(\lvert \langle {\boldsymbol{a}}_j, \boldsymbol{x} \rangle \rvert^2 \bigr)_{1 \le j \le m}$, where $\boldsymbol{a}_j \in \mathbb{H}^n$ are known sensing vectors with $\mathbb{H} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}\}$. For each $p \ge 1$, we define the condition number $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p}$ as the ratio of optimal upper and lower Lipschitz constants of $\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ measured in the $\ell_p$ norm, with respect to the metric $\mathrm {dist}_\mathbb{H}\left(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}\right) = \|\boldsymbol{x} \boldsymbol{x}^\ast - \boldsymbol{y} \boldsymbol{y}^\ast\|_*$. We establish universal lower bounds on $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p}$ for any sensing matrix $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{H}^{m \times d}$, proving that $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_1} \ge \pi/2$ and $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_2} \ge \sqrt{3}$ in the real case $(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{R})$, and $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p} \ge 2$ for $p=1,2$ in the complex case $(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{C})$. These bounds are shown to be asymptotically tight: both a deterministic harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{E}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 2}$ and Gaussian random matrices $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{H}^{m \times d}$ asymptotically attain them. Notably, the harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{E}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 2}$ achieves the optimal lower bound $\sqrt{3}$ for all $m \ge 3$ when $p=2$, thus serving as an optimal sensing matrix within $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 2}$. Our results provide the first explicit uniform lower bounds on $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p}$ and offer insights into the fundamental stability limits of phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Power Amplifier-Resilient Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Joint Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter analyzes the effects of power amplifiers (PAs) on the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO systems. We model signal transmission incorporating nonlinear PA distortion and derive a unified spectral efficiency (SE) expression applicable to arbitrary precoding schemes. To combat PA-induced performance degradation, a joint optimization approach for user association and max-min power control is proposed. Furthermore, a low-complexity alternative is developed to approximate the joint optimization with reduced computational overhead. Simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed approaches over conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>On Drug Delivery System Parameter Optimisation via Semantic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of semantic information theory to drug delivery systems (DDS) within the molecular communication (MC) framework. To operationalise this, we observe a DDS as a molecular concentration-based channel. Semantic information is defined as the amount of information required for a DDS to achieve its therapeutic goal in a dynamic environment. We derive it by introducing interventions, defined as modifications to DDS parameters, a viability function, and system-environment correlations quantified via the channel capacity. Here, the viability function represents DDS performance based on a drug dose-response relationship. Our model considers a system capable of inducing functional changes in a receiver cancer cell, where exceeding critical DDS parameter values can significantly reduce performance or cost-effectiveness. By analysing the MC-based DDS model through a semantic information perspective, we examine how correlations between the internalised particle concentration $(Y)$ and the particle concentration in the extracellular environment $(X)$ evolve under interventions. The final catalogue of results provides a quantitative basis for DDS design and optimisation, offering a method to determine optimal DDS parameter values under constraints such as chemical budget, desired effect and accuracy. Thus, the proposed framework can serve as a novel tool for guiding DDS design and optimisation.</description>

      <title>When Every Symbol Counts: Resilient Wireless Systems Under Finite Blocklength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G evolves, wireless networks become essential for critical operations and enable innovative applications that demand seamless adaptation to dynamic environments and disruptions. Because these vital services require uninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is essential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery procedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short packets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication efficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can backfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under longer blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints within a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the wireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused by FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results reveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery from the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the system to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption, yielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we show that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster reconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the trade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL conditions.</description>

      <title>Some more constructions of $n-$cycle permutation polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $ n-$cycle permutation polynomials with small n have the advantage that their compositional inverses are efficient in terms of implementation. These permutation polynomials have significant applications in cryptography and coding theory. In this article, we propose criteria for the construction of $ n-$cycle permutation using linearized polynomial $ L(x) $ for larger $ n $. Furthermore, we investigate and generalize certain novel forms of $ n-$cycle permutation polynomials. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by constructing explicit $ n-$cycle permutation of the form $ L(x)+\gamma h(Tr_{q^{m}/q}(x)) $, and $ G(x)+\gamma f(x) $ with a Boolean function $ f(x) $. The polynomial $ x^{d}+\gamma f(x) $ with $ f(x) $ being a Boolean function is shown to be quadruple and quintuple permutation polynomials. Moreover, linear binomial triple-cycle permutation polynomials are constructed.</description>

      <title>Pinsker's inequality for adapted total variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinsker's classical inequality asserts that the total variation $TV(\mu, \nu)$ between two probability measures is bounded by $\sqrt{ 2H(\mu|\nu)}$ where $H$ denotes the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). Considering the discrete metric, $TV$ can be seen as a Wasserstein distance and as such possesses an adapted variant $ATV$. Adapted Wasserstein distances have distinct advantages over their classical counterparts when $\mu, \nu$ are the laws of stochastic processes $(X_k)_{k=1}^n, (Y_k)_{k=1}^n$ and exhibit numerous applications from stochastic control to machine learning. In this note we observe that the adapted total variation distance $ATV$ satisfies the Pinsker-type inequality $$ ATV(\mu, \nu)\leq \sqrt{n} \sqrt{2 H(\mu|\nu)}.$$</description>

      <title>dreaMLearning: Data Compression Assisted Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage, which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types, tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning, and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for efficient and scalable learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive one-weight codes over a finite field of non-prime order are equivalent to special subspace coverings of the points of a projective space, which we call multispreads. The current paper is devoted to the characterization of the parameters of multispreads, which is equivalent to the characterization of the parameters of additive one-weight codes and, via duality, of additive completely regular codes of covering radius 1 (intriguing sets). We characterize these parameters for the case of the prime-square order of the field and make a partial characterization for the prime-cube case and the case of the fourth degree of a prime, including a complete characterization for orders 8, 27, and 16.

      <title>Bounding User Contributions for User-Level Differentially Private Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of releasing the sample mean of bounded samples in a dataset, privately, under user-level $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP). We aim to derive the optimal method of preprocessing data samples, within a canonical class of processing strategies, in terms of the error in estimation. Typical error analyses of such \emph{bounding} (or \emph{clipping}) strategies in the literature assume that the data samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and sometimes also that all users contribute the same number of samples (data homogeneity) -- assumptions that do not accurately model real-world data distributions. Our main result in this work is a precise characterization of the preprocessing strategy that gives rise to the smallest \emph{worst-case} error over all datasets -- a \emph{distribution-independent} error metric -- while allowing for data heterogeneity. We also show via experimental studies that even for i.i.d. real-valued samples, our clipping strategy performs much better, in terms of \emph{average-case} error, than the widely used bounding strategy of Amin et al. (2019).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated communication and sensing, which can make full use of the limited spectrum resources to perform communication and sensing tasks simultaneously, is an up-and-coming technology in wireless communication networks. In this work, we investigate the secrecy performance of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted secure integrated communication, sensing, and computing system, where the UAV sends radar signals to locate and disrupt potential eavesdroppers while providing offload services to ground users (GUs). Considering the constraints of UAV maximum speed, transmit power, and propulsion energy, as well as secure offloading, data transmission, and computation time, the total energy consumption of GUs is minimized by jointly optimizing user offloading ratio, user scheduling strategy, transmit beamforming, and UAV trajectory. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem caused by tightly coupled dependent variables. In particular, the original optimization problem is decomposed into four sub-optimization problems, and the non-convex sub-problems are transformed into approximately convex forms via successive convex approximation. Then, all sub-problems are solved successively by using the block coordinate descent technique. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dependence of Samples along the Langevin Dynamics and Algorithms via Contraction of $\Phi$-Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixing time of a Markov chain determines how fast the iterates of the Markov chain converge to the stationary distribution; however, it does not control the dependencies between samples along the Markov chain. In this paper, we study the question of how fast the samples become approximately independent along popular Markov chains for continuous-space sampling: the Langevin dynamics in continuous time, and the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Proximal Sampler in discrete time. We measure the dependence between samples via $\Phi$-mutual information, which is a broad generalization of the standard mutual information, and which is equal to $0$ if and only if the the samples are independent. We show that along these Markov chains, the $\Phi$-mutual information between the first and the $k$-th iterate decreases to $0$ exponentially fast in $k$ when the target distribution is strongly log-concave. Our proof technique is based on showing the Strong Data Processing Inequalities (SDPIs) hold along the Markov chains. To prove fast mixing of the Markov chains, we only need to show the SDPIs hold for the stationary distribution. In contrast, to prove the contraction of $\Phi$-mutual information, we need to show the SDPIs hold along the entire trajectories of the Markov chains; we prove this when the iterates along the Markov chains satisfy the corresponding $\Phi$-Sobolev inequality, which is implied by the strong log-concavity of the target distribution.</description>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, encapsulates the complementary relationship between the wave and particle behaviors of quantum systems. In this paper, we treat quantum coherence and classical distinguishability as complementary resources and uncover a novel duality relation, which is explored through quantum state discrimination under incoherent operations, extending beyond typical interference scenarios. We prove that in an ensemble of mutually orthogonal pure states, the sum of `co-bits', quantifying the coherence preserved under incoherent free operations, and classical bits, representing the distinguishability extracted via quantum state discrimination, is bounded. This coherence-distinguishability duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between the simultaneous preservation of a system's quantum coherence (wave-like property) and the extraction of its classical distinguishability (particle-like property). Our findings provide a fresh perspective on wave-particle duality through quantum resource theories, offering complementary insights into manipulating quantum and classical resources, with implications for quantum foundations and quantum technologies.</description>
