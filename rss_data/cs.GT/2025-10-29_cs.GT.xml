      <title>Matchings Under Biased and Correlated Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Emergent Topological Properties in Socio-Economic Networks through Learning Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individual learning behavior and structural dynamics interact is essential to modeling emergent phenomena in socioeconomic networks. While bounded rationality and network adaptation have been widely studied, the role of heterogeneous learning rates both at the agent and network levels remains under explored. This paper introduces a dual-learning framework that integrates individualized learning rates for agents and a rewiring rate for the network, reflecting real-world cognitive diversity and structural adaptability.
  Using a simulation model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma and Quantal Response Equilibrium, we analyze how variations in these learning rates affect the emergence of large-scale network structures. Results show that lower and more homogeneously distributed learning rates promote scale-free networks, while higher or more heterogeneously distributed learning rates lead to the emergence of core-periphery topologies. Key topological metrics including scale-free exponents, Estrada heterogeneity, and assortativity reveal that both the speed and variability of learning critically shape system rationality and network architecture. This work provides a unified framework for examining how individual learnability and structural adaptability drive the formation of socioeconomic networks with diverse topologies, offering new insights into adaptive behavior, systemic organization, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Self interest cumulative subtraction games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subtraction games have a rich literature as normal-play combinatorial games (e.g., Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy, 1982). Recently, the theory has been extended to zero-sum scoring play (Cohensius et al. 2019). Here, we take the approach of cumulative self-interest games, as introduced in a recent framework preprint by Larsson, Meir, and Zick. By adapting standard Pure Subgame Perfect Equilibria (PSPE) from classical game theory, players must declare and commit to acting either ``friendly'' or ``antagonistic'' in case of indifference. Whenever the subtraction set has size two, we establish a tie-breaking rule monotonicity: a friendly player can never benefit by a deterministic deviation to antagonistic play. This type of terminology is new to both ``economic'' and ``combinatorial'' games, but it becomes essential in the self-interest cumulative setting. The main result is an immediate consequence of the tie-breaking rule's monotonicity; in the case of two-action subtraction sets, two antagonistic players are never better off than two friendly players, i.e., their PSPE utilities are never greater. For larger subtraction sets, we conjecture that the main result continues to hold, while tie-breaking monotonicity may fail, and we provide empirical evidence in support of both statements.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Nash Equilibrium Synthesis with Partially Ordered Temporal Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a central solution concept for reasoning about self-interested agents. We address the problem of synthesizing Nash equilibria in two-player deterministic games on graphs, where players have private, partially-ordered preferences over temporal goals. Unlike prior work, which assumes preferences are common knowledge, we develop a communication protocol for equilibrium synthesis in settings where players' preferences are private information. In the protocol, players communicate to synthesize equilibria by exchanging information about when they can force desirable outcomes. We incorporate privacy by ensuring the protocol stops before enough information is revealed to expose a player's preferences. We prove completeness by showing that, when no player halts communication, the protocol either returns an equilibrium or certifies that none exists. We then prove privacy by showing that, with stopping, the messages a player sends are always consistent with multiple possible preferences and thus do not reveal some given secret regarding a player's true preference ordering. Experiments demonstrate that we can synthesize non-trivial equilibria while preserving privacy of preferences, highlighting the protocol's potential for applications in strategy synthesis with constrained information sharing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Screening with Endogenous Information Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-product monopoly pricing where the seller jointly designs the selling mechanism and the information structure for the buyer to learn his values. Unlike the case with exogenous information, we show that when the seller controls information, even uniform pricing guarantees at least half of the optimal revenue. Moreover, for negatively affiliated or exchangeable value distributions, deterministic pricing is revenue-optimal. Our results highlight the power of information design in making pricing mechanisms approximately optimal in multi-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Data Auctions for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of data selling for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks in Generative AI applications. We model each buyer's valuation of a dataset with a natural coverage-based valuation function that increases with the inclusion of more relevant data points that would enhance responses to anticipated queries. Motivated by issues such as data control and prior-free revenue maximization, we focus on the scenario where each data point can be allocated to only one buyer. We show that the problem of welfare maximization in this setting is NP-hard even with two bidders, but design a polynomial-time $(1-1/e)$ approximation algorithm for any number of bidders. Unfortunately, however, this efficient allocation algorithm fails to be incentive compatible. The crux of our approach is a carefully tailored post-processing step called data burning which retains the $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor but achieves incentive compatibility. Our thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world image and text datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our algorithm compared to popular baseline algorithms for combinatorial auctions.</description>
