      <title>Conditional estimates on the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions with applications to low-lying zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we use Beurling-Selberg extremal functions to bound the mean and mean square of the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions to a large prime modulus $q$. As applications, we give alternative proofs of several results on low-lying zeros of $L(s,\chi)$ and obtain a new lower bound on the proportion of $L(s,\chi)$ modulo $q$ with zeros close to the central point. In particular, we show conditionally that for any $\beta&gt;1/4$, there exist a positive proportion of Dirichlet $L$-functions whose first zero has height less than $\beta$ times the average spacing between consecutive zeros.</description>

      <title>Subconvex $L^p$-sets, Weyl's inequality, and equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine sets $\mathscr A$ of natural numbers having the property that for some real number $p\in (0,2)$, one has the subconvex bound $$\int_0^1 \Bigl| \sum_{n\in \mathscr A\cap [1,N]}e(n\alpha)\Bigr|^p\, {\rm d}\alpha \ll N^{-1}|\mathscr A\cap [1,N]|^p.$$ We show that exponential sums over such sets satisfy inequalities analogous to Weyl's inequality, and in many circumstances of the same strength as classical versions of Weyl's bound. We also examine equidistribution of polynomials modulo $1$ in which the summands are restricted to these subconvex $L^p$-sets. In addition, we describe applications to problems involving character sums and averages of arithmetic functions.</description>

      <title>On certain sums over primes and the Riesz function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer some comments on series involving the M$\ddot{o}$bius function which approximate sums over primes. To accomplish this, we utilize the derivative of the Gram series by applying Riemann-Stieltjes integration. We offer a new formula connecting the derivative of the Gram series to the Riesz function, which we then use to obtain general integral relationships.</description>

      <title>The Weyl bound for triple product L-functions in the cubic level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the strong subconvexity bounds for triple product L-functions in the cubic level aspect. Our proof on the Weyl-type bound synthesizes techniques from classical analytic number theory with methods in automorphic forms and representation theory. The methods include the refined Petersson trace formula for the newforms of cubic level, classical Voronoi summation formula, Jutila's circle method, Kuznetsov trace formula and the spectral large sieve inequality.</description>

      <title>Iwahori-Hecke model for the universal supersingular representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$. When $F$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, Anandavardhanan-Borisagar and Anandavardhanan-Jana introduced an Iwahori-Hecke model for the universal supersingular representation $\pi_r$ in the regular case $ 0 &lt; r &lt; q-1$. When $F=\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, the first author introduced an Iwahori-Hecke model for $\pi_r$ when $r = 0, p - 1$. We extend this result to an arbitrary local field $F$ for $r = 0, q - 1$.
  We also write down an explicit non-split self-extension of $\pi_r$ which has a four-dimensional space of $I(1)$-invariants when $F = \mathbb{Q}_p$ and $r = 0, p-1$.</description>

      <title>Galois module structures and the Hasse principle in twist families via the distribution of Selmer groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address several seemingly disparate problems in arithmetic geometry: the statistical behaviour of the Galois module structure of Mordell--Weil groups of a fixed elliptic curve over varying quadratic extensions; the frequency of failure of the Hasse principle in quadratic twist families of genus $1$ hyperelliptic curves; and the Hasse principle for Kummer varieties. The common technical ingredient for all of these is a result on the distribution of $2$-Selmer ranks in certain sparse families of quadratic twists of a given abelian variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to rings and fields, written for a quarter-long undergraduate course. It includes the basic properties of ideals, modules, algebras and polynomials, the constructions of ring extensions and finite fields, some number-theoretical applications (such as a proof of quadratic reciprocity and Jacobsthal's formulas for $p = x^2 + y^2$), and tastes of Gr\"obner bases and the Smith normal form. Familiarity with groups and vector spaces is assumed, though no deep results from either theory are used.
  Over 200 exercises are included (mostly without solutions).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Scalar Selection in Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Differential Evolution for Enhanced Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fundamental component of modern public-key cryptosystems that enable efficient and secure digital signatures, key exchanges, and encryption. Its core operation, scalar multiplication, denoted as $k \cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar, relies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$ is selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in resource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches may yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to side-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we introduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly maximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a population-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary representations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically uniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection as an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based cryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly higher than conventionally generated scalars. The proposed method can be integrated into existing ECC-based protocols, offering a deterministic, tunable alternative to traditional randomness, ideal for applications in blockchain, secure messaging, IoT, and other resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conjectural formula for the order of the poles of intertwining operators in the context of the representation theory of general linear groups over $p$-adic fields. More specifically, we conjecturally relate the order of the pole to the dimension of a Hom-space associated with irreducible components of Lusztig's characteristic variety in type $A$. We verify the conjecture in a wide range of cases.</description>

      <title>Multifactorisations and Divisor Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a joint ordered multifactorisation for a given positive integer $n\geq 2$ into $m$ parts, where $n=n_1~\times~\ldots~\times~n_m$, and each part $n_j$ is split into one or more component factors. Our central result gives an enumeration formula for all such joint ordered multifactorisations $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$. As an illustrative application, we show how each such factorisation can be used to uniquely construct and so count the number of distinct additive set systems (historically referred to as complementing set systems). These set systems under set addition generate the first $n$ non-negative consecutive integers uniquely and, when each component set is centred about 0, exhibit algebraic invariances. For fixed integers $n$ and $m$, invariance properties for $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$ are established. The formula for $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$ is comprised of sums over associated divisor functions and the Stirling numbers of the second kind, and we conclude by deducing sum over divisor relations for our counting function $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$.</description>

Abstract: We define a Hopf algebra of polylogarithms of an arbitrary field, which is a candidate for a conjectural Hopf algebra of framed mixed Tate motives.

      <title>Quadratic forms of holomorphic cusp forms and the decay of their $\ell^p$-norms for $0 &lt; p &lt; 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that, given an orthonormal basis of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, conditionally, quadratic forms composed of cusp forms -- each expressed as a bounded linear combination of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms -- are generally not themselves expressible as bounded linear combinations of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms when the sum of the weights exceeds some absolute constant, provided that the coefficients of the quadratic form satisfy appropriate nonvanishing and boundedness conditions. This illustrates the finiteness of the number of solutions to the linear equation of modular forms equated to a quadratic form of large weight.
  We also show that, conditionally, for $0 &lt; p &lt; 2$, the $\ell^p$-norm of such quadratic forms in holomorphic Hecke cusp forms tends to zero asymptotically with respect to expansion in this orthonormal basis of Hecke eigenforms.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation phenomena in mixed moments for orthogonal families of $L$-Functions and their applications: automorphic periods, Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight forms, and isotropy subgroups of Tate--Shafarevich groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Keating--Snaith conjecture for orthogonal families may be viewed as analogous to a Gaussian distribution with a negative mean, and the possibility that mixed moments resemble a composition of independent moments, these two insights were combined and applied in Lester and Radziwi\l\l's proof of quantum unique ergodicity for half-integral weight automorphic forms, via Soundararajan's method under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This observation also yields a crucial and nontrivial saving in the resolution of certain arithmetic problems.
  Inspired by this, we select a series of typical mixed orthogonal families of $L$-functions: $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twisted families. Under the assumptions of the GRH and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture, we prove upper bound estimates for their moments and present the following three arithmetic applications:
  i) The decorrelation of automorphic periods averaged over imaginary quadratic fields.
  ii) The decorrelation of Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms.
  iii) The decorrelation of the analytic orders of isotropy subgroups of Tate--Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves under quadratic twists.</description>

      <title>New examples of $M\setminus L$: intruder sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</description>

      <title>On the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1967, Klarner proposed a problem concerning the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations. The problem considers the feasibility of placing $n$ mutually non-attacking queens on the reflecting chessboard, an $n\times n$ chessboard with a $1\times n$ "reflecting strip" of squares added along one side of the board. A queen placed on the reflecting chessboard can attack the squares in the same row, column, and diagonal, with the additional feature that its diagonal path can be reflected via the reflecting strip. Klarner noted the equivalence of this problem to a number theory problem proposed by Slater, which asks: for which $n$ is it possible to pair up the integers 1 through $n$ with the integers $n+1$ through $2n$ such that no two of the sums or differences of the $n$ pairs of integers are the same. We prove the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations for all sufficiently large $n$, thereby resolving both Slater's and Klarner's questions for all but a finite number of integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotient function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotient function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type dichotomy for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

Abstract: Gosper developed an algorithm for performing arithmetic operations on continued fractions (CFs), getting a CF as the result. Straightforward implementation of the algorithm leads to infinite loops on some inputs. Here we present a modified version of the arithmetic algorithm and prove that it avoids all difficulties with infinite loops. We then combine CF arithmetic with the spigot algorithm to compute the CF expansions of exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions of CFs. We have implemented these algorithms in Haskell.</description>
