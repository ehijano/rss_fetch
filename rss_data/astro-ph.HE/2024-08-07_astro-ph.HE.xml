      <title>XMM-Newton high-resolution spectroscopy of EXO 0748-676 after its re-emergence from a long quiescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EXO 0748-676 is a well-studied neutron star (NS) Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) that recently emerged from 16 years of quiescence into a new outburst. Here, we report the results from a 53 ks XMM-Newton observation to compare with studies for the previous outburst, particularly focusing on high-resolution spectroscopy using the same instrument (RGS) that produced important results for this source during the previous outburst. The EPIC light curve reveals a type I X-ray burst at MJD 60492.31. The entire data are divided into burstless, pre-, and post-burst spectra to understand the effect of the burst on the ionization structure. The spectra for dip and non-dip phases are also created. The primary spectral feature in all phases is a broad O VII recombination line, along with velocity-broadened OVIII, NVII, and Ne IX lines. Notably, the Ne IX line is detected at different ionization states for the pre-burst (11.65 \AA) and post-burst (13.56 \AA) phases. The O VIII line profile also shows a difference in equivalent width between dip and non-dip phases. These findings suggest the presence of highly ionized circumstellar material or collisionally ionized gas affected by the burst and dips. The source remains in a soft spectral state, which is consistent with observations during the previous outburst.</description>

      <title>Impact of Systematic Modeling Uncertainties on Kilonova Property Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise atomic structure and therefore the wavelength-dependent opacities of lanthanides are highly uncertain. This uncertainty introduces systematic errors in modeling transients like kilonovae and estimating key properties such as mass, characteristic velocity, and heavy metal content. Here, we quantify how atomic data from across the literature as well as choices of thermalization efficiency of r-process radioactive decay heating impact the light curve and spectra of kilonovae. Specifically, we analyze the spectra of a grid of models produced by the radiative transfer code \texttt{Sedona} that span the expected range of kilonova properties to identify regions with the highest systematic uncertainty. Our findings indicate that differences in atomic data have a substantial impact on estimates of lanthanide mass fraction, spanning approximately one order of magnitude for lanthanide-rich ejecta, and demonstrate the difficulty in precisely measuring the lanthanide fraction in lanthanide-poor ejecta. Mass estimates vary typically by 25-40$\%$ for differing atomic data. Similarly, the choice of thermalization efficiency can affect mass estimates by 20$\%$ to 50$\%$. Observational properties such as color and decay rate are \textit{highly} model-dependent. Velocity estimation, when fitting solely based on the light curve, can have a typical error of $\sim 100\%$. Atomic data of light r-process elements can strongly affect blue emission. Even for well-observed events like GW170817, the total lanthanide production estimated using different atomic datasets can vary by a factor of $\sim6$.</description>

      <title>Argon X-ray absorption in the local ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive analysis of the argon K-edge absorption region (3.1-4.2 \AA) using high-resolution HETGS {\it Chandra} spectra of 33 low-mas X-ray binaries. Utilizing R-matrix theory, we computed new K photoabsorption cross-sections for {\rm Ar}~{\sc i}--{\rm Ar}~{\sc xvi} species. For each X-ray source, we estimated column densities for the {\rm Ar}~{\sc i}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc ii}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc iii}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc xvi}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc xvii} and {\rm Ar}~{\sc xviii} ions, which trace the neutral, warm and hot components of the gaseous Galactic interstellar medium. We examined their distribution as a function of Galactic latitude, longitude, and distances to the sources. However, no significant correlations were discerned among distances, Galactic latitude, or longitude. Future X-ray observatories will allow us to benchmark the atomic data as the main resonance lines will be resolved.</description>

      <title>A NuSTAR Census of the X-ray Binary Population of the M31 Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using hard (E&gt;10 keV) X-ray observations with NuSTAR, we are able to differentiate between accretion states, and thus compact object types, of neutron stars and black holes in X-ray binaries (XRBs) in M31, our nearest Milky Way-type neighbor. Using ten moderate-depth (20-50 ks) observations of the disk of M31 covering a total of ~0.45 deg$^{2}$, we detect 20 sources at 2$\sigma$ in the 4-25 keV band pass, 14 of which we consider to be XRB candidates. This complements an existing deeper (100-400 ks) survey covering ~0.2 deg$^{2}$ of the bulge and the northeastern disk. We make tentative classifications of 9 of these sources with the use of diagnostic color-intensity and color-color diagrams, which separate sources into various neutron star and black hole regimes, identifying 3 black holes and 6 neutron stars. In addition, we create X-ray luminosity functions for both the full (4-25 keV) and hard (12-25 keV) band, as well as sub-populations of the full band based on compact object type and association with globular clusters. Our best fit globular cluster XLF is shallower than the field XLF, and preliminary BH and NS XLFs suggest a difference in shape based on compact object type. We find that the cumulative disk XLFs in the full and hard band are best fit by power laws with indices of 1.32 and 1.28 respectively. This is consistent with models of the Milky Way XLF from Grimm et al. (2002), Voss &amp; Ajello (2010), and Doroshenko et al. (2014).</description>

      <title>Exploring the broadband spectral and timing characteristics of GRS 1915+105 with AstroSat and NICER observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we undertake a spectral-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary source GRS 1915+105 using simultaneous observations carried out by AstroSat (LAXPC and SXT) and NICER in 2017. The source showed two flux levels (high and low), whose energy spectra can be described by the thermal comptonization of disk photons. The spectral parameters obtained by the joint fitting of SXT/LAXPC and NICER/LAXPC were consistent. The power density spectra from LAXPC and NICER revealed a broad, prominent feature at approximately 2 Hz. The energy dependence of the fractional R.M.S. and time lag of this feature cannot be explained by only variations of coronal spectral parameters. Instead, a model where the coronal heating rate varies first and induces a change in the disk temperature and inner radius can explain the variation. Our results underline the importance of simultaneous observations by AstroSat and NICER and highlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the spectral-temporal behavior of black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the range of impacts of helium in the spectra of double detonation models for Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the double detonation scenario the ignition of a surface He detonation on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf leads to a secondary core detonation. Double detonation models have shown promise for explaining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with a variety of luminosities. A key feature of such models is unburnt He in the ejecta, which can show significant variation in both its mass and velocity distribution. Many previous radiative transfer simulations for double detonation models have neglected treatment of non-thermal ionization and excitation, preventing them from robustly assessing whether He spectral features are expected to form. We present a non local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer simulation, including treatment for non-thermal electrons, for a double detonation model with a modest mass of He (${\sim}$0.04 M${\odot}$) ejected at reasonably low velocities (${\sim}$12000$\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Despite our simulation predicting no clear optical He features, a strong and persistent He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ absorption feature forms that is significantly blended with the spectral contribution of Mg II 10927$\,\r{A}$. For some normal SNe Ia the Mg feature shows an extended blue wing, previously attributed to C I, however the simulated He feature shows its strongest absorption at wavelengths consistent with this wing. We therefore suggest this extended wing is instead a spectral signature of He. The He feature predicted by this particular model is too strong and persistent to be consistent with normal SNe Ia, however, this motivates further work to use this observable signature to test the parameter space for double detonation models.</description>

      <title>Crab Pulsar: IXPE Observations Reveal Unified Polarization Properties Across Optical and Soft X-Ray Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-dependent analysis of the polarized emission from the Crab pulsar based on three sets of observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We found that a phenomenological model involving a simple linear transformation of the Stokes parameters adequately describes the IXPE data. This model enables us to establish, for the first time, a connection between the polarization properties of the Crab pulsar in the optical and soft X-ray bands, suggesting a common underlying emission mechanism across these bands. In particular, the phase-dependent polarization degree in X-rays for pure pulsar emission shows similar features but is reduced by a factor $\approx (0.46-0.56)$ compared to the optical band, implying an energy-dependent polarized emission. In addition, using this model, we study the polarization angle swing in X-rays and identify a potentially variable phase-shift at the interpulse relative to the optical band, alongside a phase-shift marginally consistent with zero persisting at the main pulse. While the variability presents a new challenge for theoretical interpretation, our findings suggest that the emission mechanism for the main pulse is likely located far from the neutron star surface, perhaps near or beyond the light cylinder, rather than operating in the inner magnetosphere where vacuum birefringence is expected to be at work. Ignoring the phase-shifts would result in identical phase-dependent polarization angles between the optical and X-ray bands for pure pulsar emission.</description>

      <title>Study of a Tilted Thin Accretion Disk around a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accreting collapsed object GRO J1655-40 could contain the gravitomagnetic monopole (GMM), and it was shown to be better described by the Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) spacetime instead of the Kerr spacetime. The warped accretion disk has also been observed for the same collapsed object. Motivated by these, we study a tilted thin inner accretion disk around a slowly-spinning KTN black hole that contains a small GMM. Such a tilting could have a significant effect on the X-ray spectral and timing features via the Lense-Thirring effect. Taking into account the contribution from the inner accretion disk for the KTN black hole, here we calculate the radial profile of a tilt angle. Depending on the numerical values of the viscosity of the accreting material and Kerr parameter, we show that the GMM tends the angular momentum of the disk to align along the black hole's spin axis, or to make it more tilted. Our solution for the radial profile of the tilted disk around a KTN black hole could be useful to probe the strong gravity regime, and could also give indirect evidence for the existence of GMM in nature.</description>

      <title>A search for soft X-ray emission lines in the afterglow spectrum of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 221009A was the Brightest gamma-ray burst Of All Time (BOAT), surpassing in prompt brightness all GRBs discovered in ~50 yr and in afterglow brightness in ~20 yr. We observed the BOAT with XMM-Newton 2.3 d after the prompt. The X-ray afterglow was still very bright and we collected the largest number of photons with the Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) on a GRB. We searched the RGS data for narrow emission or absorption features. We did not detect any bright line feature. A candidate narrow feature is identified at a (rest-frame) energy of 1.455+0.006-0.014 keV, consistent with an Mg XII K{\alpha} emission line, slightly redshifted (0.012) with respect to the host galaxy. We assessed a marginal statistical significance of 3.0sigma for this faint feature based on conservative Monte Carlo simulations, which requires caution for any physical interpretation. If this line feature would be for real, we propose that it might originate from the reflection in the innermost regions of the infalling funnel from low-level late-time activity emission of the central engine.</description>

      <title>Ninety percent circular polarization detected in a repeating fast radio burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extra-galactic sources with unknown physical mechanisms. They emit millisecond-duration radio pulses with isotropic equivalent energy of $10^{36}\sim10^{41}$ ergs. This corresponds to a brightness temperature of FRB emission typically reaching the level of $10^{36}$ K, but can be as high as above $10^{40}$ K for sub-microsecond timescale structures, suggesting the presence of underlying coherent relativistic radiation mechanisms. polarization carries the key information to understand the physical origin of FRBs, with linear polarization usually tracing the geometric configuration of magnetic fields and circular polarization probing both intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects. Here we show that the repeating sources FRB 20201124A emits $90.9\pm 1.1\%$ circularly polarized radio pulses. Such a high degree of circular polarization was unexpected in theory and unprecedented in observation in the case of FRBs, since such a high degree of circular polarization was only common among Solar or Jovian radio activities, attributed to the sub-relativistic electrons. We note that there is no obvious correlation between the degree of circular polarization and burst fluence. Besides the high degree of circular polarization, we also detected rapid swing and orthogonal jump in the position angle of linear polarization. The detection of the high degree circular polarization in FRB 20201124A, together with its linear polarization properties that show orthogonal modes, place strong constraints on FRB physical mechanisms, calling for an interplay between magnetospheric radiation and propagation effects in shaping the observed FRB radiation.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Flashes on Helium Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 $M_\odot$ helium novae with mass accretion rates of $(1.6-7.5) \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days to 10 years) and high X-ray luminosities ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transients or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical pre-maximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of nova study. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from literature on extra-galactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the redshift dependence of (rest frame) host galaxy dispersion measures of localized FRBs by assuming it to vary as a simple power law ($\propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$). We simultaneously fit $\alpha$ as well as the host dispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that $\alpha\approx 0$ is preferred over higher values of $\alpha$ with either a positive or negative sign. Such constraints have implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Supernovae Interacting with Dense Circumstellar Matter with a Flat Density Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure ($\rho \propto r^{-s}, s &lt; 1.5$) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes - the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM - predominantly determine the qualitative behaviour of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the nature and identity of dark matter is a key goal in the physics community. In the case that TeV-scale dark matter particles decay or annihilate into standard model particles, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (greater than 100 GeV) will be present in the final state. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array that can indirectly detect VHE gamma rays in an energy range of 100 GeV to &gt; 30 TeV. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are ideal candidates in the search for dark matter due to their high dark matter content, high mass-to-light ratios, and their low gamma-ray fluxes from astrophysical processes. This study uses a legacy data set of 638 hours collected on 17 dSphs, built over 11 years with an observing strategy optimized according to the dark matter content of the targets. The study addresses a broad dark matter particle mass range, extending from 200 GeV to 30 PeV. In the absence of a detection, we set the upper limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross section.</description>

      <title>Selection bias obfuscates the discovery of fast radio burst sources</title>

Abstract: FRBs are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterised by their high energy and short-duration (~$\mu$s-ms)[1]. Their elusive physical origin remains a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates[2],[3]. Previous studies have employed various methodologies to address the FRB origin problem, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments[4]-[6], assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift[7]-[9], and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts[10]. However, these studies are susceptible to significant biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias likely leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated[6]. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is likely responsible for the observed bias[11],[12]. However, a larger sample of localised FRBs is required to robustly quantify its contribution in the inclination-related selection bias.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Constraints on Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions with $N$-Body Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the elastic scattering cross section between dark matter and protons using the DES Year 3 weak lensing data. This scattering induces a dark acoustic oscillation structure in the matter power spectra. To address non-linear effects at low redshift, we utilize principal component analysis alongside a limited set of $N$-body simulations, improving the reliability of our matter power spectrum prediction. We further perform a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive the upper bounds on the DM-proton elastic scattering cross-section, assuming different velocity dependencies. Our results, presented as the first Frequentist upper limits, are compared with the ones obtained by Bayesian approach. Compared with the upper limits derived from the Planck cosmic microwave background data, our findings from DES Year 3 data exhibit improvements of up to a factor of five. In addition, we forecast the future sensitivities of the China Space Station Telescope, the upcoming capabilities of this telescope could improve the current limits by approximately one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar electron number density via neutrino flavor data at Borexino</title>

Abstract: Understanding the physics of the deep solar interior, and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and binary neutron-star (NS) mergers, is of keen interest in many avenues of research. To date, this physics is based largely on simulations via forward integration. While these simulations provide valuable constraints, it could be insightful to adopt the "inverse approach" as a point of comparison. Within this paradigm, parameters of the solar interior are not output based on an assumed model, but rather are inferred based on real data. We take the specific case of solar electron number density, which historically is taken as output from the standard solar model. We show how one may arrive at an independent constraint on that density profile based on available neutrino flavor data from the Earth-based Borexino experiment. The inference technique's ability to offer a unique lens on physics can be extended to other datasets, and to analogous questions for CCSN and NS mergers, albeit with simulated data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Muonization by Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing in Protoneutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$-$\bar\nu_s$ mixing in the protoneutron star (PNS) created in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We point out the importance of the feedback on the general composition of the PNS in addition to the obvious feedback on the $\nu_\mu$ lepton number. We show that for our adopted mixing parameters $\delta m^2\sim 10^2$~keV$^2$ and $\sin^2 2\theta$ consistent with the current constraints, sterile neutrino production is dominated by the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein conversion of $\bar\nu_\mu$ into $\bar\nu_s$ and that the subsequent escape of $\bar\nu_s$ increases the $\nu_\mu$ lepton number, which in turn enhances muonization of the PNS primarily through $\nu_\mu+n\to p+\mu^-$. While these results are qualitatively robust, their quantitative effects on the dynamics and active neutrino emission of CCSNe should be evaluated by including $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$-$\bar\nu_s$ mixing in the simulations.</description>
