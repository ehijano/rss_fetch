      <title>Perturbative soft graviton theorems in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion assuming a small cosmological constant, we compute the leading and subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in \cite{Sayali_Diksha} for the soft photons.</description>

      <title>Classical Black Hole Probes of UV Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Swampland program, black hole attractors have been employed to probe infinite distances in moduli space, where the EFT cutoff goes to zero in Planck units and UV effects become significant. In this paper, we take the perspective of the two-derivative action of string theoretic effective field theories and explore various families of extremal black hole solutions that probe infinite distance limits at their horizons. While these solutions do not include higher-order corrections in the EFT expansion, we find that, in many cases, the smallest BPS black holes in these families remarkably reproduce either the species scale or some other Kaluza-Klein scale. In highly supersymmetric cases, this match with UV scales even persists in the interior of moduli space. We even find that non-BPS black holes solutions in circle compactification of Type II string theories follow the species scale in decompactification limits. These observations suggests that the two-derivative action may encode information about relevant UV scales. We discuss the interplay of these results with emergence and UV/IR mixing in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entropy Cone Beyond AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend all known area inequalities obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces of AdS boundary regions -- the holographic entropy cone -- to static generalized entanglement wedges of bulk regions in arbitrary spacetimes. The generalized holographic entropy cone is subject to a mutual independence condition on the bulk regions: each bulk input region must be outside the entanglement wedge of the union of all others. The condition captures when gravitating regions involve fundamentally distinct degrees of freedom despite the nonlocality inherent in the holographic principle.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter is, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states, and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter.</description>

      <title>From noncommutative Yang-Mills to noncommutative gravity through a classical double copy map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the first nontrivial noncommutative correction to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, which arises from the double copy of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory (ncYM). We start by considering linear and quadratic $\theta$-corrections up to cubic order in fields in ncYM theory and in arbitrary $D$ dimensions. We compute the first nontrivial corrections to the three-points vertex operators and use them to construct a double copy theory of the form ncYM $\times$ ncYM. The resulting theory is given by a double geometrical formalism which includes noncommutative corrections to the perturbative cubic double field theory (DFT) formulation, where the star product of the theory is doubled in agreement with the doubling of the physical coordinates of the theory. Upon solving the level matching condition the noncommutative products are identified and they produced $\theta^2$-corrections to the cubic DFT action. We analyze the pure gravitational limit of this formulation considering $D=4$ and imposing the transverse-traceless gauge.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describe a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behavior expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>No "chaos" in bosonic string massive scalar amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute directly in covariant formalism a variety of four point massive scalar amplitudes in bosonic string with scalars up to level 10 and at least one tachyon.
  All computed amplitudes are perfectly regular and show no sign of erratic behavior.
  We give a naive argument based on a very simple model of why this can reasonably be expected and we check on the explicit examples that the intuition derived from the model is sensible.
  Furthermore we discuss the complications due to null states (BRST exact states) in actually computing the covariant bosonic string spectrum and how these can be overcome by using a ``$\Pi$ gauge'' which makes manifest that the degeneration of any spin at any mass level is independent on the spacetime dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article continues previous work done in arXiv:2406.01907. It is shown in more detail how vacuum partition functions and the cosmological constant vanish at all orders of perturbation theory. Further, all-multiplicity higher-loop amplitudes are given and shown to be modular invariant, to have proper factorization, and to be UV-finite at least up to one-loop level, formally even to all levels. Therefore, the model provides a modular invariant and unitary N=8 supergravity theory in twistor space with embedded Super-Yang-Mills and promising UV-finiteness behavior.</description>

      <title>A microscopic model of de Sitter spacetime with an observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple microscopic quantum mechanical model of low-dimensional de Sitter holography with an observer. Using semiclassical gravity and elementary thermodynamic considerations, we derive a formula for the total entropy of a 3D Schwarzschild-de Sitter universe with an observer. We then match this entropy formula with the exactly known spectral density of the double scaled SYK model. Our result gives a de Sitter interpretation of the appearance of two notions of temperature in DSSYK.</description>

      <title>Holographic confining theories on space-times with constant positive curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Varying the curvature, quantum phase transitions are investigated in holographic confining QFTs defined on a fixed constant positive curvature background. We find a competition between two branches of solutions and a phase transition as one varies the space-time curvature. The low-curvature phase has the same kind of IR geometry as the flat-space solution, while the high-curvature phase has a regular interior. We argue that, depending on the leading asymptotic exponent of the scalar potential, the transition may be first-order or higher-order.</description>

      <title>Microcausality without Lorentz invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcausality -- the vanishing of commutators outside the lightcone -- is a fundamental property of relativistic quantum field theories. We derive its implications for two-point functions of scalar operators on {\it Lorentz-breaking} states. We restrict to spatially homogeneous and isotropic states, at zero and finite temperature, such as finite-density states of matter and primordial inflationary states. In a mixed $(t, \vec k \, )$ representation, we find certain analyticity and exponential boundedness conditions, which we verify in a variety of examples. Crucially, we discuss how our conditions can be tested within the regime of validity of Lorentz-breaking low-energy effective field theories, clarifying the role of the group velocity of low-energy excitations. In the cosmological case, we derive a positivity condition on an EFT coefficient in an inflationary background. Lastly, we comment on how microcausality can be used to constrain higher-point correlation functions, via suitable nested commutators.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from vacuum transition during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.</description>

      <title>Displacement memory and B-memory in generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) memory effect is studied in the context of generalised Ellis-Bronnikov (GEB) wormholes. We solved the geodesic equations in this wormhole spacetime, in the presence of a GW pulse. The resulting evolution of the geodesic separation shows the presence of displacement and velocity memory. Memory effect due to a gravitational wave ensures that there is a permanent effect on spacetime geometry. The corresponding geodesic evolution, being metric dependent, would display distinct results in each case. Motivated by the same, we study further aspects of memory effect on the geodesic congruences, known as the B-memory, by solving the Raychaudhuri equations. Since future GW detectors will be able to probe the memory effect, our work presents GEB spacetime as a black hole mimicker with distinguishing features.</description>

      <title>Sharp Page transitions in generic Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the entanglement dynamics of a subsystem initialized in a pure state at high energy density (corresponding to negative temperature) and coupled to a cold bath. The subsystem's R\'enyi entropies $S_\alpha$ first rise as the subsystem gets entangled with the bath and then fall as the subsystem cools. We find that the peak of the min-entropy, $\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} S_\alpha$, sharpens to a cusp in the thermodynamic limit, at a well-defined time we call the Page time. We construct a hydrodynamic ansatz for the evolution of the entanglement Hamiltonian, which accounts for the sharp Page transition as well as the intricate dynamics of the entanglement spectrum before the Page time. Our results hold both when the bath has the same Hamiltonian as the system and when the bath is taken to be Markovian. Our ansatz suggests conditions under which the Page transition should remain sharp even for R\'enyi entropies of finite index $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the weakly interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

      <title>Novel echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a novel class of echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity and show that they are generated due to the large-scale structure of the cosmos, rather than near-horizon modifications of black holes as well as wormhole spacetimes. To this end, we take into account the evolution of a massive scalar perturbation on the background geometry of conformal Weyl black holes and show that the corresponding effective potential enjoys a double-peak barrier against the incident scalar waves. We perform the calculations for the time evolution profiles of scalar perturbations to understand how the linear term in the metric function and the cosmological constant produce echoes. The Prony method is also employed to calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the early-stage quasinormal ringing phase.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons, which differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalence principle are realised in Weyl transverse gravity (and its generalisations). The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>

Abstract: QCD admits a contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which potentially gives rise to nontrivial phases and violates CP. This is essentially a question of how the vacuum reacts to the $\theta$ term. In this talk I will address the problem using new developments on the lattice. The overall solution is contrasted with the axion `solution'.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conference \emph{Black Holes Inside and Out} marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on conceptual issues, especially on the key features that distinguish the LQG approach, and on concrete results that underlie the paradigm that has emerged. This is \emph{not} meant to be an exhaustive review. Rather, it is a broad-brush stroke portrait of the present status. Further details can be found in the references listed.</description>

      <title>Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin Transformations in Quantum Electrodynamics: For Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations for a charged fermion propagator at the two-loop level in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Starting with an arbitrary covariant gauge $\xi$ and space-time dimension $d$, we provide its explicit expressions in three and four-dimensional QED. We begin with the tree-level fermion propagator in the Landau gauge and gauge-transform it to obtain an analytical expression for an all order result in an arbitrary covariant gauge. We expand it out to two-loops both for the massless and massive propagators in three and four space-time dimensions. In addition to comparing with all earlier results in the literature wherever possible, we also study constraints of multiplicative renormalizabilty of our results in four-dimensional QED which are logarithmically divergent. Finally, we analyze representative solutions of the fermion propagator which correspond to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in QED. We study the gauge dependence of these emergent solutions, that of the Euclidean pole mass and the chiral fermion condensate.</description>

Abstract: We compute exactly the scalar determinants $\det(\Delta+M^{2})$ on the two-dimensional round disks of constant curvature $R=0$, $\mp 2$, for any finite boundary length $\ell$ and mass $M$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using the $\zeta$-function prescription. When $M^{2}=\pm q(q+1)$, $q\in\mathbb N$, a simple expression involving only elementary functions and the Euler $\Gamma$ function is found. Applications to two-dimensional Liouville and Jackiw-Teitelboim quantum gravity are presented in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Bayesian RG Flow in Neural Network Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.</description>

Abstract: We show that tree-level and one-loop Mellin space correlators in anti-de Sitter space obey certain difference equations, which are the direct analog to the differential equations for Feynman loop integrals in the flat space. Finite-difference relations, which we refer to as ``summation-by-parts relations'', in parallel with the integration-by-parts relations for Feynman loop integrals, are derived to reduce the integrals to a basis. We illustrate the general methodology by explicitly deriving the difference equations and summation-by-parts relations for various tree-level and one-loop Witten diagrams up to the four-point bubble level.</description>

This allows one to compute the free energy without solving any supergravity equations, just assuming the solutions exist. As well as recovering some known results in the literature with ease, we also present new supergravity results that match with holographically dual field theory computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing techniques from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory, we model the dynamics of hierarchical triples, which are three-body systems composed of two bodies separated by a distance $r$ and a third body a distance $\rho$ away, with $r \ll \rho$. We apply the method of regions to systematically expand in the small ratio $r/\rho$ and illustrate this approach for evaluating Fourier transform integrals, which have been the bottleneck for deriving complete results in position space. In the limit where the distant third body is much heavier than the other two, we derive new analytic results in position space for the three-body conservative potential at $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ and at leading and next-to-leading order in $r/\rho$. We also derive new results for arbitrary masses in the rest frame of the distant particle. Our results are exact in velocity, and can be used in analyses involving both bound and unbound hierarchical triples in astrophysical systems.</description>

Abstract: We construct the double copy of the chiral higher-spin theory. It is a Lorentz invariant theory with the little group spectrum given by the tensor square of the chiral higher-spin theory spectrum. Moreover, its interactions factorise in close analogy with the way interactions factorise in lower-spin double-copy theories. We also propose theories, which can be viewed as products of self-dual Yang-Mills theory, self-dual gravity and chiral higher-spin theories taken in different combinations and powers.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Weyl calculus for gauge theory and non-dissipative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a theory of fermions interacting with a (in general, non-Abelian) gauge field. The theory is assumed to be essentially inhomogeneous, which might be provided by non-trivial background fields interacting with both fermions and gauge bosons. For this theory, a version of Wigner-Weyl calculus is developed, in which the Wigner transformation of the fermion Green function belongs to the adjoint representation of the gauge group. We demonstrate the power of the proposed formalism through the representation of responses of vector and axial currents to the gauge field strength through the topological invariants composed of the Wigner transformed two-point Green functions. This way a new family of non-dissipative transport phenomena is introduced. In particular, we discuss the non-Abelian versions of the chiral separation effect and of the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Holographic Generalised Gukov-Witten Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spindle and disc solutions have received significant attention in recent literature. However, it is not entirely clear what these supergravity solutions represent in the dual SCFT. In this work we elucidate this issue by considering a different global completion of the spindle solution, focusing on a single conical defect. We argue that these solutions can be interpreted as the insertion of a single (generalised) Gukov-Witten defect in the bulk SCFT. We give compelling evidence for this claim by uplifting the solutions to type IIB supergravity and showing that the five-dimensional $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS solutions uplifts to the bubbling surface operators solutions. Their less supersymmetric cousins give rise to a large class of holographic generalised Gukov-Witten surface operators for which we perform a detailed geometric analysis. To corroborate these claims we compute a variety of holographic observables such as the renormalised action, stress tensor one-point function and defect entanglement entropy. In addition, we extend the holographic inflow mechanism to account for bulk-to-defect inflow to study the symmetries and anomalies of the bulk and defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>De Sitter space constraints on brane tensions and couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of bounds on the tensions of $p$-branes in de Sitter space in terms of the Hubble rate and the strength of a class of Chern-Simons-like couplings. The world-volume couplings involve Abelian 1-form gauge fields in the bulk and possibly field strengths intrinsic to the brane. In many cases these couplings are the D-brane Chern-Simons terms present in string theory, while in other cases they are the interactions of axion domain walls with $U(1)$ fields. Our arguments use the same logic and assumptions as the recent Festina Lente proposal (thus utilizing the properties of Nariai de Sitter black holes) and generalize it to extended objects, thereby providing a bottom-up set of constraints independent of any particular UV completion. We compare these bounds to the properties of (wrapped) D-branes in Type II string theory in the weak coupling limit, under the assumption that these properties are not modified significantly in de Sitter constructions. We find that all constraints are satisfied by D-branes, providing further evidence for the Festina Lente conjecture. For the particular case of 2-branes with Chern-Simons interactions we obtain a bound, which however can be evaded if the theory contains a light axion. Similarly, we find the bounds do not apply to axion domain walls due to the presence of the axion.</description>

      <title>Uplifts in the Penumbra: Features of the Moduli Potential away from Infinite-Distance Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of meta-stable four-dimensional de Sitter vacua in type IIB string compactifications represents an important question and an ongoing area of work. There is considerable support both for stringy de Sitter vacua in the interior of moduli space and for their scarceness in the strict asymptotic regime towards infinite-distance boundaries of the compactification moduli space. Here, we present evidence for the existence of uplifting vacua in the three-form flux-induced scalar potential of the complex structure moduli of type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds in the cross-over region between the interior of the moduli space and its strictly asymptotic infinite-distance regions. Moreover, we also exhibit the existence of long-range axion valleys which, while not yet supporting slow-roll inflation, do show a flattened scalar potential from complex structure moduli backreaction and axion monodromy. We further illustrate how such regions hosting axion valleys may be obtained by using machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how to detect the large quantum fluctuations in the throat of a near-extremal black hole, where the dynamics are governed by the Schwarzian theory. To this end, we scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that the absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that the density of black hole states is suppressed in this regime. Nevertheless, two effects outweigh this suppression. First, quantum fluctuations enhance absorption transitions between individual states, with the effect becoming stronger closer to the ground state. Second, these fluctuations significantly reduce stimulated emission. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametric representation has been used since a long time for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. As a dimension independent intermediate representation, it allows a clear description of singularities. Recently, it has become a choice tool for the investigation of the type of transcendent numbersappearing in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. The inclusion of numerators has however stagnated since the ground work of Nakanishi. I here show howto greatly simplify the formulas through the use of Dodgson identities. In the massless case in particular, reduction to the completion to a vacuum graph allows for a strong reduction of the maximal power of the Symanzik polynomial in the denominator.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial black holes formation from preheating instabilities: the case of Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) in the early universe inflationary cosmology has garnered significant attention. One plausible scenario for primordial black hole (PBH) formation arises during the preheating stage following inflation. Notably, this scenario does not necessitate any ad-hoc fine-tuning of the scalar field potential. This paper focuses on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent possibility of PBH formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model for inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is based on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon during inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different phases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain range of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation (type II modes) but evolve identically to type I modes if they fall into the instability band, leading to large density perturbation above the threshold and can potentially also contribute to the PBH formation. We detail the conditions determining the possible collapse of type I and/or type II modes whose wavelengths are larger than the Jeans length we derive from the effective sound speed of scalar field fluctuations. Since the preheating stage is an 'inflaton' (approximately) matter-dominated phase, we follow the framework of the critical collapse of fluctuations and compute the mass fraction using the well-known Press-Schechter and the Khlopov-Polnarev formalisms, and compare the two. Finally, we comment on the implications of our study for the investigations concerned with primordial accretion and consequent PBH contribution to the dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytic expressions for three-flavor neutrino oscillations in presence of invisible neutrino decay and matter effects. Using the well-known Cayley-Hamilton formalism, the leading-order terms are derived for oscillation probabilities in all major channels assuming the neutrino mass eigenstate $\nu_3$ to decay. Our work extends and complements previous studies utilizing the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, providing the series expansions for $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_e$, $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\mu$, $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\tau$, $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$. The accuracy of the analytical formulas is investigated by comparing the results with numerically calculated probabilities. We also comment on the implications on unitarity violation.</description>

      <title>Kramer's Escape Rate and Phase Transition Dynamics in AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional static methods in phase transition studies, provide good insights into the thermodynamics of black holes. However, they practically lose sight of the dynamic aspects and temporal sequence of events. The Kramer's escape rate, central to our research, offers a somewhat dynamic approach to phase transition. We examine the free energy landscapes for black holes under the influence of 'dark' and 'stringy dark' structures, assessing how additional parameters affect the escape rates and dynamics of the transition during the first-order phase transition from small to large black holes. In our analysis, we consider the escape rate as a function of the black hole radius and study its variations. We will observe that, on one hand, the escape rate well represents our assumption based on the movement from zero, increasing to a maximum point, and then decreasing back to zero as reactive structures become active during the phase transition interval. However, the critical point in this method is the encounter with a specific and distinct point. This is where the diagram of the direct process (escape rate from small to large black holes) intersects with the reverse process (large to small black holes), becoming equally probable (contact point). The point, which seems improbable at the onset of the phase transition or very negligible, gains more significance as the process progresses. This increase indicates the dominance of a region where the escape rate from larger black holes to smaller ones prevails. The predominance of the reverse process, which increases as we approach the end of the process and is necessarily accompanied by a variation in radius, may be considered as a natural reaction of the black hole against the 'phase change' action. A reaction which attempting to prevent any uncontrolled radial growth that could jeopardize the stability of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the package {\tt Blade} as the first implementation of the block-triangular form improved Feynman integral reduction method. The block-triangular form has orders of magnitude fewer equations compared to the plain integration-by-parts system, allowing for strictly block-by-block solutions. This results in faster evaluations and reduced resource consumption. We elucidate the algorithms involved in obtaining the block-triangular form along with their implementations. Additionally, we introduce novel algorithms for finding the canonical form and symmetry relations of Feynman integrals, as well as for performing spanning-sector reduction. Our benchmarks for various state-of-the-art problems demonstrate that {\tt Blade} is remarkably competitive among existing reduction tools. Furthermore, the {\tt Blade} package offers several distinctive features, including support for complex kinematic variables or masses, user-defined Feynman prescriptions for each propagator, and general integrands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use recent progress on Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions [18] to give explicit, closed form formulas for the star product on some functions on the affine space ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma)$ of (smooth) connections on the trivialized principal $G$-bundle on a compact, oriented two manifold $\Sigma.$ These formulas give a close relation between knot invariants, such as the Kauffman bracket polynomial, and the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, arising in Chern Simons gauge theory, and deformation quantization of ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma).$ This relation echoes the relation between the manifold invariants of Witten [20] and Reshetikhin-Turaev [16] and {\em geometric} quantization of this space (or its symplectic quotient by the action of the gauge group). In our case this relation arises from explicit algebraic formulas arising from the (mathematically well-defined) functional integrals of [18].</description>

Abstract: We review the description of classical gravitational scatterings of two compact objects by means of the eikonal framework. This encodes via scattering amplitudes both the motion of the bodies and the gravitational-wave signals that such systems produce. As an application, we combine the next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform derived in the post-Newtonian (PN) limit with the 4PM static loss due to the linear memory effect to reproduce known results for the total angular mometum loss in the center-of-mass frame up to $\mathcal O(G^4)$ and 2.5PN order. We also provide similar expressions for the change in the system's mass dipole, discussing the subtleties related to its sensitivity to the Coulombic components of the field and to the nonlinear memory effect.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals can be expanded asymptotically with respect to some small parameters at the integrand level, a technique known as the expansion by regions. A naive expansion by regions may break down due to divergences not regulated by the spacetime dimension, exemplified by the rapidity divergences. A criterion to identify unregulated divergences is provided in this article. The analysis is conducted using both parametric and Mellin-Barnes representations, leading to a consistent conclusion. Based on this analysis, it is proven that the presence of unregulated divergences implies the degeneracies of regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <title>On Unitary 2-Group Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global internal symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to extended observables by considering unitary actions of finite global 2-group symmetries $\mathcal{G}$ on line operators. We propose that the latter transform in unitary 2-representations of $\mathcal{G}$, which we classify up to unitary equivalence. Our results recover the known classification of ordinary 2-representations of finite 2-groups, but provide additional data interpreted as a type of reflection anomaly for $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization effects in the background of a deformed compact object and implications for photon velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of vacuum polarization on light propagation in the background of a distorted, deformed compact object. Focusing on a spacetime containing two quadrupole parameters associated with the central object and external fields, we explore how these parameters influence observable effects as dynamical degrees of freedom. In this setup, we investigate electromagnetic birefringence, noting distinct polarization-dependent photon velocity variations and gravitational lens effects. Although current resolution may limit detection, future high-precision observations could reveal these quantum electrodynamics (QED) induced birefringence effects, advancing our understanding of vacuum birefringence in astrophysical contexts. We further analyze the dependence of shadow properties on the model's variables, using observational data from Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Magnetospheres around Kerr Black Holes with a Thin Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for stationary and axisymmetric black hole magnetospheres by solving the vacuum Maxwell equations in Kerr backgrounds. The poloidal magnetic field is generated by a toroidal electric current in a thin disk on the equatorial plane with an inner edge, and the poloidal electric field is induced due to the black hole spin. We assume a current distribution whose direction reverses at a radius on the disk. The magnetospheric structure is divided into the inner region and the outer one due to the current reversal. In the inner region, some magnetic field lines connect the black hole and the disk, and others surround the inner edge of the disk. In the outer region, the field lines connect the disk and infinity. We investigate the black hole spin dependence of the magnetospheric structure. In the magnetosphere around the Kerr black hole, the electric fields are generated by the black hole spin. In our model, the charge distribution is induced on the disk and the event horizon. Except near the black hole, the electric field strength is proportional to the black hole spin, while the direction of the electric field remains almost the same regardless of the spin. On the other hand, the electromagnetic field near the event horizon strongly depends on the spin. In the maximally rotating case, the magnetic field lines are expelled from the event horizon and the electric equipotential surface coincides with the horizon.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution, which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.</description>
