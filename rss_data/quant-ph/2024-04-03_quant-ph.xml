      <title>Exploring Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning for Computer Vision: Applications and Insights on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As medium-scale quantum computers progress, the application of quantum algorithms across diverse fields like simulating physical systems, chemistry, optimization, and cryptography becomes more prevalent. However, these quantum computers, known as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ), are susceptible to noise, prompting the search for applications that can capitalize on quantum advantage without extensive error correction procedures. Since, Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), faces challenges due to resource-intensive training and algorithmic opacity. Therefore, this study explores the intersection of quantum computing and ML, focusing on computer vision tasks. Specifically, it evaluates the effectiveness of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, such as the data re-uploading scheme and the patch Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model, on small-scale quantum devices. Through practical implementation and testing, the study reveals comparable or superior performance of these algorithms compared to classical counterparts, highlighting the potential of leveraging quantum algorithms in ML tasks.</description>

      <title>James-Stein Estimation in Gaussian Metrology : V2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James-Stein estimator is a biased estimator -- for a finite number of samples its expected value is not the true mean. The maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), is unbiased and asymptotically optimal. Yet, when estimating the mean of $3$ or more normally-distributed random variables, the James-Stein estimator has a smaller total (expected) error than the MLE. We introduce the James-Stein estimator to the field of quantum metrology, from both the frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. We characterise the effect of quantum phenomena on the James-Stein estimator through the lens of quantum Gaussian sensing, the task of estimating the mean of an unknown multivariate quantum Gaussian state. We find that noiseless entanglement or coherence improves performance of the James-Stein estimator, but diminishes its advantage over the MLE. In the presence of noise, the James-Stein advantage is restored. Quantum effects can also boost the James-Stein advantage. We demonstrate this by investigating multivariate postselective metrology (generalised weak-value amplification), a strategy that uses quantum effects to measure parameters with imperfect detectors. Simply by post-processing measured data differently, our techniques reduce errors in quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Photonic quantum walk with ultrafast time-bin encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum walk (QW) has proven to be a valuable testbed for fundamental inquiries in quantum technology applications such as quantum simulation and quantum search algorithms. Many benefits have been found by exploring implementations of QWs in various physical systems, including photonic platforms. Here, we propose a novel platform to perform quantum walks using an ultrafast time-bin encoding (UTBE) scheme. This platform supports the scalability of quantum walks to a large number of steps while retaining a significant degree of programmability. More importantly, ultrafast time bins are encoded at the picosecond time scale, far away from mechanical fluctuations. This enables the scalability of our platform to many modes while preserving excellent interferometric phase stability over extremely long periods of time without requiring active phase stabilization. Our 18-step QW is shown to preserve interferometric phase stability over a period of 50 hours, with an overall walk fidelity maintained above $95\%$</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Reduce Derivative Costs in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of an alternative approach, named Quantum Non-Demolition Measurement (QNDM), to efficiently estimate the gradients or the Hessians of a quantum observable. This is a key step and a resource-demanding task when we want to minimize the cost function associated with a quantum observable. In our detailed analysis, we account for all the resources needed to implement the QNDM approach with a fixed accuracy and compare them to the current state-of-the-art method. We find that the QNDM approach is more efficient, i.e. it needs fewer resources, in evaluating the derivatives of a cost function.These advantages are already clear in small dimensional systems and are likely to increase for practical implementations and more realistic situations. Since the vast majority of the Variational Quantum Algorithms can be formulated in the discussed framework, our results can have significant implications in quantum optimization algorithms and make the QNDM approach a valuable alternative to implement Variational Quantum Algorithms on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Multi-Controlled Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of multi-controlled quantum gates which provides significant reductions of cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. The operator applied on the target qubit is a unitary, special unitary, or the Pauli X operator (Multi-Controlled Toffoli). The required number of ancilla qubits is no larger than one, similarly to known linear cost decompositions. We extend our methods for any number of target qubits, and provide further cost reductions if additional ancilla qubits are available. For each type of multi-controlled gate, we provide implementations for unrestricted (all-to-all) connectivity and for linear-nearest-neighbor. All of the methods use a linear cost of gates from the Clifford+T (fault-tolerant) set. In the context of linear-nearest-neighbor architecture, the cost and depth of our circuits scale linearly irrespective of the position of the qubits on which the gate is applied. Our methods directly improve the compilation process of many quantum algorithms, providing optimized circuits, which will result in a large reduction of errors.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of logical qubits and repeated error correction with better-than-physical error rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computers hinges on the ability to scale to large system sizes, e.g., to run quantum computations consisting of roughly more than 100 million operations fault-tolerantly. This in turn requires suppressing errors to levels inversely proportional to the size of the computation. As a step towards this ambitious goal, we present experiments on a trapped-ion QCCD processor where, through the use of fault-tolerant encoding and error correction, we are able to suppress logical error rates to levels below the physical error rates. In particular, we show Bell states encoded in the [[7,1,3]] code with error rates 9.8 to 500 times lower than at the physical level, and Bell states encoded in a [[12,2,4]] code with error rates 4.7 to 800 times lower than at the physical level, depending on the judicious use of post-selection. Moreover, we demonstrate repeated error correction with the [[12,2,4]] code, with logical error rates below physical circuit baselines corresponding to repeated CNOTs, and show evidence that the error rate per error correction cycle, which consists of over 100 physical CNOTs, approaches the error rate of two physical CNOTs. These results signify an important transition from noisy intermediate scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing, and demonstrate advanced capabilities required for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Solving the $KP$ problem with the Global Cartan Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric methods have useful application for solving problems in a range of quantum information disciplines, including the synthesis of time-optimal unitaries in quantum control. In particular, the use of Cartan decompositions to solve problems in optimal control, especially lambda systems, has given rise to a range of techniques for solving the so-called $KP$-problem, where target unitaries belong to a semi-simple Lie group manifold $G$ whose Lie algebra admits a $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}$ decomposition and time-optimal solutions are represented by subRiemannian geodesics synthesised via a distribution of generators in $\mathfrak{p}$. In this paper, we propose a new method utilising global Cartan decompositions $G=KAK$ of symmetric spaces $G/K$ for generating time-optimal unitaries for targets $-iX \in [\frak{p},\frak{p}] \subset \frak{k}$ with controls $-iH(t) \in \frak{p}$. Target unitaries are parametrised as $U=kac$ where $k,c \in K$ and $a = e^{i\Theta}$ with $\Theta \in \frak{a}$. We show that the assumption of $d\Theta=0$ equates to the corresponding time-optimal unitary control problem being able to be solved analytically using variational techniques. We identify how such control problems correspond to the holonomies of a compact globally Riemannian symmetric space, where local translations are generated by $\mathfrak{p}$ and local rotations are generated by $[\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}]$.</description>

      <title>Entropy production and efficiency enhancement in quantum Otto engines operating at negative temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic classical and quantum thermal machines show higher efficiency when the strokes are carried out quasi-statically. Recent theoretical and experimental work on figures of merit for thermal machines show that they have an advantage when operating in environments with negative temperatures. In an experimental proof of concept [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 240602 (2019)], it was shown that quantum Otto engines operating at negative temperatures can exhibit a behavior in which the faster the cycle is carried out, the higher the efficiency. In this work, we make use of the concept of entropy production and friction work to explain this counterintuitive behavior, and we show that it only occurs when reservoirs have negative temperatures.</description>

      <title>Extended Wannier-Stark ladder and particle-pair Bloch oscillations in dimerized non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Hermitian regime, the Wannier-Stark ladder characterizes the eigenstates of an electron in a periodic potential with an applied static electric field. In this work, we extend this concept to the complex regime for a periodic non-Hermitian system under a linear potential. We show that although the energy levels can be complex, they are still equally spaced by a real Bloch frequency. This ensures single-particle Bloch oscillations with a damping (or growing) rate. The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</description>

      <title>A simple lower bound for the complexity of estimating partition functions on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of estimating the partition function ${\mathsf{Z}}(\beta)=\sum_{x\in\chi} e^{-\beta H(x)}$ for a Gibbs distribution characterized by the Hamiltonian $H(x)$. We provide a simple and natural lower bound for quantum algorithms that solve this task by relying on reflections through the coherent encoding of Gibbs states. Our primary contribution is a $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound for the number of reflections needed to estimate the partition function with a quantum algorithm. We also prove a $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ query lower bound for classical algorithms. The proofs are based on a reduction from the problem of estimating the Hamming weight of an unknown binary string.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Quantum Processor for the Analysis of Strongly Correlated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state is determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile platform towards scalable quantum computation and optimization. In this paper we present first demonstrations of weighted graph optimization on a Rydberg atom array using annealing with local light-shifts. We verify the ability to prepare weighted graphs in 1D and 2D arrays, including embedding a five vertex non-unit disk graph using nine physical qubits. We find common annealing ramps leading to preparation of the target ground state robustly over a substantial range of different graph weightings. This work provides a route to exploring large-scale optimization of non-planar weighted graphs relevant for solving relevant real-world problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coherent seeded SU(1,1) interferometer provides a prominent technique in the field of precision measurement. We theoretically study the phase sensitivity of SU(1,1) interferometer with Kerr state seeding under single intensity and homodyne detection schemes. To find the lower bound in this case we calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound using the quantum Fisher information technique. We found that, under some conditions, the Kerr seeding performs better in phase sensitivity compared to the well-known vacuum and coherent seeded case. We expect that the Kerr state might act as an alternative non-classical state in the field of quantum information and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Certification of multi-qubit quantum systems with temporal inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating contextual correlations in quantum theory through the violation of a non-contextuality inequality necessarily needs some ``contexts" and thus assumes some compatibility relations between the measurements. As a result, any self-testing protocol based on the maximal violation of such inequality is not free from such assumptions. In this work, we propose temporal inequalities derived from non-contextuality inequalities for multi-qubit systems without assuming any compatibility relations among the measurements. We demonstrate that the new inequalities can be maximally violated via a sequential measurement scenario. Moreover, using the maximal violation of these temporal inequalities we are able to certify multi-qubit graph states and the measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum conjugate gradient method using the positive-side quantum eigenvalue transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are still challenging to solve linear systems of equations on real devices. This challenge arises from the need for deep circuits and numerous ancilla qubits. We introduce the quantum conjugate gradient (QCG) method using the quantum eigenvalue transformation (QET). The circuit depth of this algorithm depends on the square root of the coefficient matrix's condition number $\kappa$, representing a square root improvement compared to the previous quantum algorithms. The number of ancilla qubits is constant, similar to other QET-based algorithms. Additionally, to implement the QCG method efficiently, we devise a QET-based technique that uses only the positive side of the polynomial (denoted by $P(x)$ for $x\in[0,1]$). We conduct numerical experiments by applying our algorithm to the one-dimensional Poisson equation and successfully solve it. Based on the numerical results, our algorithm significantly improves circuit depth, outperforming another QET-based algorithm by three to four orders of magnitude.</description>

We observe that the pure multiqubit GHZ and W states in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition with one of their qubits being accelerated will remain non-separable irrespective of the qubit's acceleration. In these systems, we effectively captured the variation of their non-separability with respect to the acceleration of the qubit and the AR $ q $-conditional entropy parameter $ q $. However, in the corresponding multiqubit mixed states obtained by introducing a noise to the above pure states, one could get stronger conditions on their separability in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition, in terms of the mixing parameter, acceleration of the qubit and the number of qubits in the system, in the asymptotic limit of parameter $ q $. These conditions obtained from AR $ q $-conditional entropy serves as a necessary conditions for separability in such multiqubit states with a relativistic qubit.</description>

      <title>Shareability of steering in 2-producible states</title>

Abstract: Quantum steering is the phenomenon whereby one party (Alice) proves entanglement by "steering'' the system of another party (Bob) into distinct ensembles of states, by performing different measurements on her subsystem. Here, we investigate steering in a network scenario involving $n$ parties, who each perform local measurements on part of a global quantum state, that is produced using only two-party entangled states, and mixing with ancillary separable states. We introduce three scenarios which can be straightforwardly implemented in standard quantum optics architecture, which we call random $\frac{n}{2}$-pair entanglement, random pair entanglement and semi-random pair entanglement. We study steerability of the states across two-party marginals which arise in the three scenarios, and derive analytically the necessary and sufficient steering criteria for different sets of measurement settings. Strikingly, using the semi-random pair entanglement construction, one party can steer every one of the $n-1$ other parties, for arbitrarily large $n$, using only two measurements. Finally, exploiting symmetry, we study various small network configurations (three or four parties) in the three scenarios, under different measurements and produced by different two-party entangled states.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems, integral to various scientific and industrial applications, often vary significantly in their complexity and computational difficulty. Transforming such problems into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) has regained considerable research attention in recent decades due to the central role of QUBO in Quantum Annealing. This work aims to shed some light on the relationship between the problems' properties. In particular, we examine how the spectral gap of the QUBO formulation correlates with the original problem, since it has an impact on how efficiently it can be solved on quantum computers. We analyze two well-known problems from Machine Learning, namely Clustering and Support Vector Machine (SVM) training, regarding the spectral gaps of their respective QUBO counterparts. An empirical evaluation provides interesting insights, showing that the spectral gap of Clustering QUBO instances positively correlates with data separability, while for SVM QUBO the opposite is true.</description>

Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a quantum communication paradigm that transmits confidential messages directly using quantum states. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QSDC protocols can eliminate the security loopholes associated with measurement devices. To enhance the practicality and performance of MDI-QSDC protocols, we propose a one-photon-interference MDI QSDC (OPI-QSDC) protocol which transcends the need for quantum memory, ideal single-photon sources, or entangled light sources. The security of our OPI-QSDC protocol has also been analyzed using quantum wiretap channel theory. Furthermore, our protocol could double the distance of usual prepare-and-measure protocols, since quantum states sending from adjacent nodes are connected with single-photon interference, which demonstrates its potential to extend the communication distance for point-to-point QSDC.</description>

Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) guarantees both the security and reliability of information transmission using quantum states. One-photon-interference QSDC (OPI-QSDC) is a technique that enhances the transmission distance and ensures secure point-to-point information transmission, but it requires complex phase locking technology. This paper proposes a mixed-encoding one-photon-interference QSDC (MO-QSDC) protocol that removes the need for phase locking technology. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the MO-QSDC protocol could also beat the PLOB bound.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum correlations for enhanced parameter estimation. Recently, structured light enabled increased resolution and sensitivity in quantum metrology systems. However, lossy and complex setups impacting photon flux, hinder true quantum advantage while using high dimensional structured light. We introduce a straightforward mechanical rotation quantum sensing mechanism, employing high-dimensional structured light and a compact high-flux (45,000 coincidence counts per second) N00N state source with N=2. The system utilizes two opposite spiral phase plates with topological charge of up to l=16 that convert mechanical rotation into wavefront phase shifts, and exhibit a 16-fold enhanced super-resolution and 25-fold enhanced sensitivity between different topological charges, while retaining the acquisition times and with negligible change in coincidence count. Furthermore, the high photon flux enables to detect mechanical angular acceleration in real-time. Our approach paves the way for highly sensitive quantum measurements, applicable to various interferometric schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of quantum mechanics forbids a bipartite scenario for masking quantum information, however, it allows multipartite maskers. The Latin squares are found to be closely related to a series of tripartite maskers. This adds another item, significantly different from the original no-cloning theorem, to the no-go theorems. On the other hand, anyonic excitations in two dimensions exhibit exotic collective behaviors of quantum physics, and open the avenue of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Here, we give the Latin-square construction of Abelian and Ising anyons %of in the Kitaev model and study the maskable space configuration in anyonic space. The circling and braiding of Kitaev anyons are masking operations on extended hyperdisks in anyonic space. We also realize quantum information masking in a teleportation way in the Kitaev Ising anyon model.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits for Non-Unitary and Unitary Diagonal Operators with Space-Time-Accuracy trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, {\sl i.e.}, the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, {\sl i.e.}, the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, {\sl i.e.}, the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation: an initial Gaussian function is prepared on a set of qubits before being evolved through the non-unitary evolution operator of the diffusion process.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum detector tomography by high-performance computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At large scales, quantum systems may become advantageous over their classical counterparts at performing certain tasks. Developing tools to analyse these systems at the relevant scales, in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics, is therefore critical to benchmarking performance and characterising their operation. While classical computational approaches cannot perform like-for-like computations of quantum systems beyond a certain scale, classical high-performance computing (HPC) may nevertheless be useful for precisely these characterisation and certification tasks. By developing open-source customised algorithms using high-performance computing, we perform quantum tomography on a megascale quantum photonic detector covering a Hilbert space of $10^6$. This requires finding $10^8$ elements of the matrix corresponding to the positive operator valued measure (POVM), the quantum description of the detector, and is achieved in minutes of computation time. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of the problem, we achieve highly efficient parallel scaling, paving the way for quantum objects up to a system size of $10^{12}$ elements to be reconstructed using this method. In general, this shows that a consistent quantum mechanical description of quantum phenomena is applicable at everyday scales. More concretely, this enables the reconstruction of large-scale quantum sources, processes and detectors used in computation and sampling tasks, which may be necessary to prove their nonclassical character or quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</description>

      <title>The ground state of electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We adopt both periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circumference direction to explore the finite size effect. We study doping levels of $1/6$, $1/8$, and $1/12$ which represent the most interesting region in the phase diagram of electron-doped cuprates. We find that for width-4 and 6 systems, the ground state for fixed doping switches between anti-ferromagnetic Neel state and stripe state under different boundary conditions and with system widths, indicating the presence of large finite size effect in the $t-t'-J$ model. We also have a careful analysis of the $d$-wave pairing correlations which also changes quantitatively with boundary conditions and widths of the system. However, the pairing correlations are enhanced when the system becomes wider for all dopings, suggesting the existence of possible long-ranged superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit. The width-8 results are found to be dependent on the starting state in the DMRG calculation for the kept states we can reach. For width-8 system only Neel (stripe) state can be stabilized in DMRG calculation for $1/12$ ($1/6$) doping, while both stripe and Neel states are stable in the DMRG sweep for $1/8$ doping, regardless of the boundary conditions. These results indicate that $1/8$ doping is likely to lie in the boundary of a phase transition between the Neel phase with lower doping and the stripe phase with higher doping, consistent with the previous study. The sensitivity of ground state on boundary conditions and size observed in this work is similar to that in the $t'$- Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Normal weak eigenstate thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable interacting models. For intensive observables that are sums of local operators, because of their polynomially vanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm, weak eigenstate thermalization occurs in quadratic and integrable interacting systems. Here, we unveil a novel weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models whose single-particle sector exhibits quantum chaos (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we show that there are few-body observables with a nonvanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm that are guarrantied to exhibit a polynomially vanishing variance of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. For quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians, we prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the 3D Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ and XXZ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this paper, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation in the presence of noise in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average, and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the players' behavior in the thermodynamic limit, and we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighboring players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this paper demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of the one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra: examples in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing feature of type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra is that the entropy of the mixed states is negative. Although the type classification of von Neumann algebra and its consequence in holography have been extensively explored recently, there has not been an explicit calculation of entropy in some physically interesting models with type II$_1$ algebra. In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy $S_n$ of the fixed length state $\{|n\rangle\}$ in Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which has been recently shown to exhibit type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra. These states furnish an orthogonal basis for 0-particle chord Hilbert space. We systematically study $S_n$ and its R\'enyi generalizations $S_n^{(m)}$ in various limit of DSSYK model, ranging $q\in[0,1]$. We obtain exotic analytical expressions for the scaling behavior of $S_n^{(m)}$ at large $n$ for random matrix theory limit ($q=0$) and SYK$_2$ limit ($q=1$), for the former we observe highly non-flat entanglement spectrum. We then dive into triple scaling limits where the fixed chord number states become the geodesic wormholes with definite length connecting left/right AdS$_2$ boundary in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. In semi-classical regime, we match the boundary calculation of entanglement entropy with the dilaton value at the center of geodesic, as a nontrivial check of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.</description>

Abstract: Lattice softness has a significant impact on charge carrier dynamics in condensed matter systems, contributing to the emergence of various properties and functions. Examples include the remarkable carrier lifetimes and defect tolerances of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Recent studies suggest the contribution of quartic anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations. The quartic anharmonicity can be discussed with a double-well potential, and the transition between the two minima can be coarse-grained as a two-state jump stochastic process. Such a stochastic approach is typically employed to describe dynamic fluctuations introduced into a system by two-state transitions in the surroundings. To investigate charge transport in materials, however, it is crucial to describe not only the fluctuations but also the dynamic lattice distortion associated with charge transport. Therefore, there is a need for a theory to describe the charge carrier dynamics proceeding alongside the lattice distortion dynamics. In this study, we present a theory that describes quantum dynamics under the influence of an environment with two stable states, termed a bistable environment. The theory describes the effects of fluctuations and dissipation induced from the bistable environment in a reasonable manner, and the effects exhibit a different temperature dependence than the widely employed Gaussian environment. The physical implication of this temperature dependence is provided in terms of the environmental dynamics. The results of this study are expected to provide a step forward in describing charge carrier dynamics in materials with lattice softness and pronounced lattice anharmonicity, e.g., hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Moreover, these findings represent an advancement in our understanding of and capacity to predict and control the physical properties and functions of these materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Casimir effect with screened scalar fields</title>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter is one of modern physics' greatest open problems. Scalar-tensor theories with screened scalar fields like the chameleon model are among the most popular proposed solutions. In this article, we present the first analysis of the impact of a chameleon field on the dynamical Casimir effect, whose main feature is the particle production associated with a resonant condition of boundary periodic motion in cavities. For this, we employ a recently developed method to compute the evolution of confined quantum scalar fields in a globally hyperbolic spacetime by means of time-dependent Bogoliubov transformations. As a result, we show that particle production is reduced due to the presence of the chameleon field. In addition, our results for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the mean number of created particles agree with known results in the absence of a chameleon field. Our results initiate the discussion of the evolution of quantum fields on screened scalar field backgrounds.</description>

      <title>QDsim: An user-friendly toolbox for simulating large-scale quantum dot device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce QDsim, a python package tailored for the rapid generation of charge stability diagrams in large-scale quantum dot devices, extending beyond traditional double or triple dots. QDsim is founded on the constant interaction model from which we rephrase the task of finding the lowest energy charge configuration as a convex optimization problem. Therefore, we can leverage the existing package CVXPY, in combination with an appropriate powerful solver, for the convex optimization which streamlines the creation of stability diagrams and polytopes. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate how QDsim enables the generation of large-scale dataset that can serve a basis for the training of machine-learning models for automated tuning algorithms. While the package currently does not support quantum effects beyond the constant interaction model, QDsim is a tool that directly addresses the critical need for cost-effective and expeditious data acquisition for better tuning algorithms in order to accelerate the development of semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm Framework for Discrete Probability Distributions with Applications to R\'enyi Entropy Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating statistical properties is fundamental in statistics and computer science. In this paper, we propose a unified quantum algorithm framework for estimating properties of discrete probability distributions, with estimating R\'enyi entropies as specific examples. In particular, given a quantum oracle that prepares an $n$-dimensional quantum state $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{p_{i}}|i\rangle$, for $\alpha&gt;1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, our algorithm framework estimates $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy $H_{\alpha}(p)$ to within additive error $\epsilon$ with probability at least $2/3$ using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1-\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon + \sqrt{n}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$ queries, respectively. This improves the best known dependence in $\epsilon$ as well as the joint dependence between $n$ and $1/\epsilon$. Technically, our quantum algorithms combine quantum singular value transformation, quantum annealing, and variable-time amplitude estimation. We believe that our algorithm framework is of general interest and has wide applications.</description>

Abstract: Machine Learning models capable of handling the large datasets collected in the financial world can often become black boxes expensive to run. The quantum computing paradigm suggests new optimization techniques, that combined with classical algorithms, may deliver competitive, faster and more interpretable models. In this work we propose a quantum-enhanced machine learning solution for the prediction of credit rating downgrades, also known as fallen-angels forecasting in the financial risk management field. We implement this solution on a neutral atom Quantum Processing Unit with up to 60 qubits on a real-life dataset. We report competitive performances against the state-of-the-art Random Forest benchmark whilst our model achieves better interpretability and comparable training times. We examine how to improve performance in the near-term validating our ideas with Tensor Networks-based numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum repeaters have long been established to be essential for distributing entanglement over long distances. Consequently, their experimental realization constitutes a core challenge of quantum communication. However, there are numerous open questions about implementation details for realistic, near-term experimental setups. In order to assess the performance of realistic repeater protocols, we here present ReQuSim, a comprehensive Monte-Carlo based simulation platform for quantum repeaters that faithfully includes loss and models a wide range of imperfections such as memories with time-dependent noise. Our platform allows us to perform an analysis for quantum repeater setups and strategies that go far beyond known analytic results: This refers to being able to both capture more realistic noise models and analyse more complex repeater strategies. We present a number of findings centered around the combination of strategies for improving performance, such as entanglement purification and the use of multiple repeater stations, and demonstrate that there exist complex relationships between them. We stress that numerical tools such as ours are essential to model complex quantum communication protocols aimed at contributing to the quantum internet.</description>

      <title>On the power of one pure steered state for EPR-steering with a pair of qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As originally introduced, the EPR phenomenon was the ability of one party (Alice) to steer, by her choice between two measurement settings, the quantum system of another party (Bob) into two distinct ensembles of pure states. As later formalized as a quantum information task, EPR-steering can be shown even when the distinct ensembles comprise mixed states. Consider the scenario where Alice and Bob each have a qubit and Alice performs dichotomic projective measurements. In this case, the states in the ensembles to which she can steer form the surface of an ellipsoid ${\cal E}$ in Bob's Bloch ball. Further, let the steering ellipsoid ${\cal E}$ have nonzero volume. It has previously been shown that if Alice's first measurement setting yields an ensemble comprising two pure states, then this, plus any one other measurement setting, will demonstrate EPR-steering. Here we consider what one can say if the ensemble from Alice's first setting contains only one pure state $\mathsf{p}\in{\cal E}$, occurring with probability $p_\mathsf{p}$. Using projective geometry, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition analytically for Alice to be able to demonstrate EPR-steering of Bob's state using this and some second setting, when the two ensembles from these lie in a given plane. Based on this, we show that, for a given ${\cal E}$, if $p_\mathsf{p}$ is high enough [$p_{\sf p} &gt; p_{\rm max}^{{\cal E}} \in [0,1)$] then any distinct second setting by Alice is sufficient to demonstrate EPR-steering. Similarly we derive a $p_{\rm min}^{{\cal E}}$ such that $p_\mathsf{p}&gt;p_{\rm min}^{{\cal E}}$ is necessary for Alice to demonstrate EPR-steering using only the first setting and some other setting. Moreover, the expressions we derive are tight; for spherical steering ellipsoids, the bounds coincide: $p_{\rm max}^{{\cal E}} = p_{\rm min}^{{\cal E}}$.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic encoding is an approach for quantum information processing, promising lower hardware overhead by encoding in the many levels of a harmonic oscillator mode. Scaling to multiple modes requires weak interaction for independent control, yet strong interaction for fast control. Applying fast and efficient universal control on multiple modes remains an open problem. Surprisingly, we find that displacements conditioned on the state of a single qubit ancilla coupled to multiple harmonic oscillators are sufficient for universal control. We present the conditional-no operation concept, which can be used for reducing the duration of entangling gates. Within this guiding concept, we develop the conditional not displacement control method which enables fast generation and control of bosonic states in multi-mode systems weakly coupled to a single ancilla qubit. Our method is fast despite the weak ancilla coupling. The weak coupling in turn allows for excellent separability and thus independent control. We demonstrate our control on a superconducting transmon qubit weakly coupled to a multi-mode superconducting cavity. We create both entangled and separable cat-states in different modes of the multi-mode cavity, showing entangling operations at low cross-talk while maintaining independent control of the different modes. We show that the operation time is not limited by the inverse of the coupling rate, which is the typical timescale, and we exceed it by almost 2 orders of magnitude. We verify our results with an efficient method for measurement of the multi-mode characteristic function which employs our conditional not displacement. Our results inspire a new approach toward general entangling operations and allow for fast and efficient multi-mode bosonic encoding and measurement.</description>

Abstract: Self-testing of quantum devices based on observed measurement statistics is a method to certify quantum systems using minimal resources. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. \textbf{A} 101, 032106 (2020)], a scheme based on observing measurement statistics that demonstrate Kochen-Specker contextuality has been shown to certify two-qubit entangled states and measurements without the requirement of spatial separation between the subsystems. However, this scheme assumes a set of compatibility conditions on the measurements which are crucial to demonstrating Kochen-Specker contextuality. In this work, we propose a self-testing protocol to certify the above two-qubit states and measurements without the assumption of the compatibility conditions, and at the same time without requiring the spatial separation between the subsystems. Our protocol is based on the observation of sequential correlations leading to the maximal violation of a temporal inequality derived from non-contextuality inequality. Moreover, our protocol is robust to small experimental errors or noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooling the motion of trapped ions to near the quantum ground state is crucial for many applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, certain motional modes of trapped-ion crystals can be difficult to cool due to weak or zero interaction between the modes and the cooling radiation, typically laser beams. We overcome this challenge by coupling a mode with weak cooling radiation interaction to one with strong cooling radiation interaction using parametric modulation of the trapping potential, thereby enabling indirect cooling of the former. In this way, we demonstrate near-ground-state cooling of motional modes with weak or zero cooling radiation interaction in multi-ion crystals of the same and mixed ion species, specifically $^9$Be$^+$-$^9$Be$^+$, $^9$Be$^+$-$^{25}$Mg$^+$, and $^9$Be$^+$-$^{25}$Mg$^+$-$^9$Be$^+$ crystals. This approach can be generally applied to any Coulomb crystal where certain motional modes cannot be directly cooled efficiently, including crystals containing molecular ions, highly-charged ions, charged fundamental particles, or charged macroscopic objects.</description>

Abstract: We study the phase super-sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with the squeezed Kerr and coherent states as the inputs. We discuss the lower bound in phase sensitivity by considering the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and corresponding quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB). With the help of single intensity detection (SID), intensity difference detection (IDD) and homodyne detection (HD) schemes, we find that our scheme gives better sensitivity in both the lossless as well as in lossy conditions as compared to the combination of well-known results of inputs as coherent plus vacuum, coherent plus squeezed vacuum and double coherent state as the inputs. Because of the possibility of generation of squeezed Kerr state (SKS) with the present available quantum optical techniques, we expect that SKS may be an alternative nonclassical resource for the improvement in the phase super-sensitivity of the MZI under realistic scenario.</description>

Abstract: Neutral Atom Quantum Computing (NAQC) emerges as a promising hardware platform primarily due to its long coherence times and scalability. Additionally, NAQC offers computational advantages encompassing potential long-range connectivity, native multi-qubit gate support, and the ability to physically rearrange qubits with high fidelity. However, for the successful operation of a NAQC processor, one additionally requires new software tools to translate high-level algorithmic descriptions into a hardware executable representation, taking maximal advantage of the hardware capabilities. Realizing new software tools requires a close connection between tool developers and hardware experts to ensure that the corresponding software tools obey the corresponding physical constraints. This work aims to provide a basis to establish this connection by investigating the broad spectrum of capabilities intrinsic to the NAQC platform and its implications on the compilation process. To this end, we first review the physical background of NAQC and derive how it affects the overall compilation process by formulating suitable constraints and figures of merit. We then provide a summary of the compilation process and discuss currently available software tools in this overview. Finally, we present selected case studies and employ the discussed figures of merit to evaluate the different capabilities of NAQC and compare them between two hardware setups.</description>

Abstract: Here we are investigating the enhancement in phase sensitivity and resolution in Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based quantum LiDAR. We are using multi-photonic state (MPS), superposition of four coherent states [1], as the input state and binary outcome parity photon counting measurement and binary outcome zero-nonzero photon counting measurement as the measurement schemes. We thoroughly investigate the results in lossless as well as in lossy cases. We found enhancement in resolution and phase sensitivity in comparison to the coherent state and even coherent superposition state (ECSS) based quantum LiDAR. Our analysis shows that MPS may be an alternative nonclassical resource in the field of quantum imaging and quantum sensing technologies, like in quantum LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of the Quantum Rate-Distortion Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum rate-distortion function plays a fundamental role in quantum information theory, however there is currently no practical algorithm which can efficiently compute this function to high accuracy for moderate channel dimensions. In this paper, we show how symmetry reduction can significantly simplify common instances of the entanglement-assisted quantum rate-distortion problems. This allows us to better understand the properties of the quantum channels which obtain the optimal rate-distortion trade-off, while also allowing for more efficient computation of the quantum rate-distortion function regardless of the numerical algorithm being used. Additionally, we propose an inexact variant of the mirror descent algorithm to compute the quantum rate-distortion function with provable sublinear convergence rates. We show how this mirror descent algorithm is related to Blahut-Arimoto and expectation-maximization methods previously used to solve similar problems in information theory. Using these techniques, we present the first numerical experiments to compute a multi-qubit quantum rate-distortion function, and show that our proposed algorithm solves faster and to higher accuracy when compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient solution of the non-unitary time-dependent Schrodinger equation on a quantum computer with complex absorbing potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of adding complex absorbing potential at the boundaries when solving the one-dimensional real-time Schr\"odinger evolution on a grid using a quantum computer with a fully quantum algorithm described on a $n$ qubit register. Due to the complex potential, the evolution mixes real- and imaginary-time propagation and the wave function can potentially be continuously absorbed during the time propagation. We use the dilation quantum algorithm to treat the imaginary-time evolution in parallel to the real-time propagation. This method has the advantage of using only one reservoir qubit at a time, that is measured with a certain success probability to implement the desired imaginary-time evolution. We propose a specific prescription for the dilation method where the success probability is directly linked to the physical norm of the continuously absorbed state evolving on the mesh. We expect that the proposed prescription will have the advantage of keeping a high probability of success in most physical situations. Applications of the method are made on one-dimensional wave functions evolving on a mesh. Results obtained on a quantum computer identify with those obtained on a classical computer. We finally give a detailed discussion on the complexity of implementing the dilation matrix. Due to the local nature of the potential, for $n$ qubits, the dilation matrix only requires $2^n$ CNOT and $2^n$ unitary rotation for each time step, whereas it would require of the order of $4^{n+1}$ C-NOT gates to implement it using the best-known algorithm for general unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Coherence in resonance fluorescence</title>

Abstract: Resonance fluorescence (RF) of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak excitation. These properties are commonly explained disjoinedly as the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light, until a recent theory attributes anti-bunching to the laser-like spectrum's interference with the incoherently scattered light. However, the theory implies higher-order scattering processes, and led to an experiment purporting to validate an atom's simultaneous scattering of two photons. If true, it could complicate RF's prospects in quantum information applications. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all RF photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the RF's spectral and correlation properties. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, with the strongest effects measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole RF and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides novel understandings of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <title>Pseudo Twirling Mitigation of Coherent Errors in non-Clifford Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional circuit paradigm, utilizing a limited number of gates to construct arbitrary quantum circuits, is hindered by significant noise overhead. For instance, the standard gate paradigm employs two CNOT gates for the partial CPhase rotation in the quantum Fourier transform, even when the rotation angle is very small. In contrast, some quantum computer platforms can directly implement such operations using their native interaction, resulting in considerably shorter and less noisy implementations for small rotation angles. Unfortunately, coherent errors stemming from qubit crosstalk and calibration imperfections render these implementations impractical. In Clifford gates such as the CNOT, these errors can be addressed through Pauli twirling (also known as randomized compiling). However, this technique is not applicable to the non-Clifford native implementations described above. The present work introduces, analyzes, and experimentally demonstrates a technique called `Pseudo Twirling' to address coherent errors in general gates and circuits. Additionally, we experimentally showcase that integrating pseudo twirling with a quantum error mitigation method called `Adaptive KIK' enables the simultaneous mitigation of both noise and coherent errors in non-Clifford gates. Due to its unique features pseudo twirling could become a valuable asset in enhancing the capabilities of both present and future NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: Subsystems of a composite system in a pure state generally exist in mixed states and undergo changes with the overall state. This phenomenon arises from the coherence of the entire system and represents a crucial distinction between quantum and classical systems. Such a quantum property can enhance the work of an Otto heat engine, where two coupled qubits serve as the working substance, allowing situations in which negative work output initially occurred to now yield positive work. We utilize the imagery of Maxwell's demon to explain the reason for positive work in this Otto cycle, attributing it to the increased coherence after the mutual measurement of the two subsystems. Conversely, the quantum measurement-erase cycle typically outputs negative work, attributed to the decoherence of the instrument during the measurement process.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multi-party entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that precludes entanglement-free regions, and thus protects quantum correlations. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junction parametric amplifiers have become essential tools for microwave quantum circuit readout with minimal added noise. Even after improving at an impressive rate in the last decade, they remain vulnerable to magnetic field, which limits their use in many applications such as spin qubits, Andreev and molecular magnet devices, dark matter searches, etc. Kinetic inductance materials, such as granular aluminum (grAl), offer an alternative source of non-linearity with innate magnetic field resilience. We present a non-degenerate amplifier made of two coupled grAl resonators resilient to in-plane magnetic field up to 1 T. It offers 20 dB of gain close to the quantum limit of added noise, with a gain-bandwidth product of 28 MHz and -110 dBm input saturation power.</description>

Abstract: Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements in quantum communication applications. However, for each combination of a cavity geometry with a quantum emitter system, there are specific challenges in the optimization of the emission properties and cavity-emitter interaction. Here, we present a thorough investigation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), emitting in the telecom O-band, integrated in an open fiber-cavity. The design provides an optical micro-cavity tunable in all spatial dimensions with intrinsic fiber-coupling. Consequently, it offers a promising approach to a high collection efficiency and the investigation of spatially and spectrally varying samples. On the other hand, the system is also susceptible to vibrational noise. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive study of the cavity and emitter properties together with an analysis of the fluctuations of the cavity length. Due to the Purcell enhancement, we observe a reduction of the decay times of up to a factor of ${2.46(2)}$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Quantum Shannon: Circuit Construction for General n-Qubit Gates Based on Block ZXZ-Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new optimized quantum block-ZXZ decomposition method [7,8,10] that results in more optimal quantum circuits than the quantum Shannon decomposition (QSD)[27], which was introduced in 2006 by Shende et al. The decomposition is applied recursively to generic quantum gates, and can take advantage of existing and future small-circuit optimizations. Because our method uses only one-qubit gates and uniformly controlled rotation-Z gates, it can easily be adapted to use other types of multi-qubit gates. With the proposed decomposition, a general 3-qubit gate can be decomposed using 19 CNOT gates (rather than 20). For general $n$-qubit gates, the proposed decomposition generates circuits that have $\frac{22}{48}4^n - \frac{3}{2}2^n +\frac{5}{3}$ CNOT gates, which is less that the best known exact decomposition algorithm by $(4^{n-2} -1)/3$ CNOT gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Coset Approach to Topological Quantum Computation with Fibonacci Anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a promising conformal field theory realization scheme for topological quantum computation based on the Fibonacci anyons, which are believed to be realized as quasiparticle excitations in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion fractional quantum Hall state in the second Landau level with filling factor $\nu=12/5$. These anyons are non-Abelian and are known to be capable of universal topological quantum computation. The quantum information is encoded in the fusion channels of pairs of such non-Abelian anyons and is protected from noise and decoherence by the topological properties of these systems.The quantum gates are realized by braiding of these anyons. We propose here an implementation of the $n$-qubit topological quantum register in terms of $2n+2$ Fibonacci anyons. The matrices emerging from the anyon exchanges, i.e. the generators of the braid group for one qubit are derived from the coordinate wave functions of a large number of electron holes and 4 Fibonacci anyons which can furthermore be represented as correlation functions in $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic two-dimensional conformal field theory. The representations of the braid groups for more than 4 anyons are obtained by fusing pairs of anyons before braiding, thus reducing eventually the system to 4 anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores quantum field theories with pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, where PT-symmetric Hamiltonians serve as a special case. In specific regimes, these pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians have real eigenspectra, orthogonal eigenstates, and unitary time evolution. So far, most pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories have been constructed using analytic continuation or by adding non-Hermitian terms to otherwise Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, in this paper, we take a different approach. We construct pseudo-Hermitian scalar and fermionic quantum field theories from first principles by extending the Poincar\'e algebra to include non-Hermitian generators. This allows us to develop consistent pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, with Lagrangian densities that transform appropriately under the proper Poincar\'e group. By doing so, we establish a more solid theoretical foundation for the emerging field of non-Hermitian quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behaviour, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalises the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially-transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>Dynamical characterization of $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases via quantum quenches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complete characterization of a generic $d$-dimensional Floquet topological phase is usually hard for the requirement of information about the micromotion throughout the entire driving period. In a recent work [L. Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 183001 (2020)], an experimentally feasible dynamical detection scheme was proposed to characterize the integer Floquet topological phases using quantum quenches. However, this theory is still far away from completion, especially for free-fermion Floquet topological phases, where the states can also be characterized by $Z_{2}$ invariants. Here we develop the first full and unified dynamical characterization theory for the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases of different dimensionality and tenfold-way symmetry classes by quenching the system from a trivial and static initial state to the Floquet topological regime through suddenly changing the parameters and turning on the periodic driving. By measuring the minimal information of Floquet bands via the stroboscopic time-averaged spin polarizations, we show that the topological spin texture patterns emerging on certain discrete momenta of Brillouin zone called the $0$ or $\pi$ gap highest-order band-inversion surfaces provide a measurable dynamical $Z_{2}$ Floquet invariant, which uniquely determines the Floquet boundary modes in the corresponding quasienergy gap and characterizes the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology. The applications of our theory are illustrated via one- and two-dimensional models that are accessible in current quantum simulation experiments. Our work provides a highly feasible way to detect the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology and completes the dynamical characterization for the full tenfold classes of Floquet topological phases, which shall advance the research in theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement Dynamics of Fractons in Tilted Bose-Hubbard Chains</title>

Abstract: Fractonic constraints can lead to exotic properties of quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the dynamics of fracton excitations on top of the ground states of a one-dimensional, dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model. We show that nearby fractons undergo a collective motion mediated by exchanging virtual dipole excitations, which provides a powerful dynamical tool to characterize the underlying ground state phases. We find that in the gapped Mott insulating phase, fractons are confined to each other as motion requires the exchange of massive dipoles. When crossing the phase transition into a gapless Luttinger liquid of dipoles, fractons deconfine. Their transient deconfinement dynamics scales diffusively and exhibits strong but subleading contributions described by a quantum Lifshitz model. We examine prospects for the experimental realization in tilted Bose-Hubbard chains by numerically simulating the adiabatic state preparation and subsequent time evolution, and find clear signatures of the low-energy fracton dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, various notions of dynamical phase transitions have emerged to describe far-from-equilibrium criticality. A unifying framework connecting these different concepts is still missing, and would provide significant progress towards understanding far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. Initializing our system in a thermal ensemble and subsequently performing quantum quenches in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we establish a direct connection between excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) and two major types of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), by relating the phases of the latter to the critical energies and conservation laws in the former. Our work provides further insight into how various concepts of non-ground-state criticality are intimately connected, paving the way for a unified framework of far-from-equilibrium universality.</description>

      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Quantum Circuit Imperfections on Networks and Computer Applications</title>

Abstract: Post Quantum and Quantum Cryptography schemes are feasible quantum computer applications for 7G networks. These schemes could possibly replace existing schemes. These algorithms have been compromised by advances in quantum search algorithms run on quantum computers like Shor algorithm. Shor algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer which is the basis of existing algorithm. This has become an available quantum computer application putting the use of ESA algorithm at risk. Our recent paper provides a detailed survey of the work on post quantum and quantum cryptography algorithms with focus on their applicability in 7G networks.
  Since the paper focuses on the cryptography algorithms as a follow up, in this paper, we provide a new framework for quantum network optimization and survey in detail the work on enabling technologies (quantum hardware) for the practical implementation of these algorithms including the most important segments of quantum hardware in 7G. As always in engineering practice practical solutions are a compromise between the performance and complexity of the implementation. For this reason, as the main contribution, the paper presents a network and computer applications optimization framework that includes implementation imperfections. The tools should be useful in optimizing future generation practical computer system design. After that a comprehensive survey of the existing work on quantum hardware is presented pointing out the sources of these imperfections. This enables us to make a fair assessment of how much investment into quantum hardware improvements contributes to the performance enhancement of the overall system. In this way a decision can be made on proper partitioning between the investment in hardware and system level complexity.</description>
