      <title>Distinguishing Martin's axiom from its restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an iteration of forcing notions satisfying the countable chain condition with minimal damage to a strong coloring. Applying this method, we prove that Martin's axiom is strictly stronger than its restriction to forcing notions satisfying the countable chain condition in all finite powers. Our method shows also the finer distinction, that Martin's axiom is strictly stronger than its restriction to forcing notions whose squares satisfy the countable chain condition.</description>

      <title>Fra\"iss\'e's conjecture, partial impredicativity and well-ordering principles, part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fra\"iss\'e's conjecture (proved by Laver) is implied by the $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension axiom of reverse mathematics, as shown by Montalb\'an. The implication must be strict for reasons of quantifier complexity, but it seems that no better bound has been known. We locate such a bound in a hierarchy of Suzuki and Yokoyama, which extends Towsner's framework of partial impredicativity. Specifically, we show that Fra\"iss\'e's conjecture is implied by a principle of pseudo $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension. As part of the proof, we introduce a cofinite version of the $\Delta^0_2$-Ramsey theorem, which may be of independent interest. We also relate pseudo $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension to principles of pseudo $\beta$-model reflection (due to Suzuki and Yokoyama) and reflection for $\omega$-models of transfinite induction (studied by Rathjen and Valencia-Vizca\'ino). In a forthcoming companion paper, we characterize pseudo $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension by a well-ordering principle, to get a transparent combinatorial bound for the strength of Fra\"iss\'e's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Is Peirce's reduction thesis gerrymandered?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that traditional formulations of the reduction thesis that tie it to privileged relational operations do not suffice for Peirce's justification of the categories, and invite the charge of gerrymandering to make it come out as true. We then develop a more robust invariant formulation of the thesis by explicating the use of triads in any relational operations, which is immune to that charge. The explication also allows us to track how Thirdness enters the structure of higher order relations, and even propose a numerical measure of it. Our analysis reveals new conceptual phenomena when negation or disjunction are used to compound relations.</description>

      <title>Logical reduction of relations: from relational databases to Peirce's reduction thesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study logical reduction (factorization) of relations into relations of lower arity by Boolean or relative products that come from applying conjunctions and existential quantifiers to predicates, i.e. by primitive positive formulas of predicate calculus. Our algebraic framework unifies natural joins and data dependencies of database theory and relational algebra of clone theory with the bond algebra of C.S. Peirce. We also offer new constructions of reductions, systematically study irreducible relations and reductions to them, and introduce a new characteristic of relations, ternarity, that measures their `complexity of relating' and allows to refine reduction results. In particular, we refine Peirce's controversial reduction thesis, and show that reducibility behavior is dramatically different on finite and infinite domains.</description>

      <title>GMSNP and Finite Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an (infinite) relational structure $\mathbb S$, we say that a finite structure $\mathbb C$ is a minimal finite factor of $\mathbb S$ if for every finite structure $\mathbb A$ there is a homomorphism $\mathbb S\to \mathbb A$ if and only if there is a homomorphism $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{A}$. In this brief note we prove that if CSP($\mathbb S$) is in GMSNP, then $\mathbb S$ has a minimal finite factor $\mathbb C$, and moreover, CSP($\mathbb C$) reduces in polynomial time to CSP($\mathbb S$). We discuss two nice applications of this result. First, we see that if a finite promise constraint satisfaction problem PCSP($\mathbb A,\mathbb B$) has a tractable GMSNP sandwich, then it has a tractable finite sandwich. We also show that if $\mathbb G$ is a non-bipartite (possibly infinite) graph with finite chromatic number, and CSP($\mathbb G$) is in GMSNP, then CSP($\mathbb G$) in NP-complete, partially answering a question recently asked by Bodirsky and Guzm\'an-Pro.</description>

      <title>The strength of the dominance rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has become standard that, when a SAT solver decides that a CNF $\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable, it produces a certificate of unsatisfiability in the form of a refutation of $\Gamma$ in some proof system. The system typically used is DRAT, which is equivalent to extended resolution (ER) -- for example, until this year DRAT refutations were required in the annual SAT competition. Recently [Bogaerts et al.~2023] introduced a new proof system, associated with the tool VeriPB, which is at least as strong as DRAT and is further able to handle certain symmetry-breaking techniques. We show that this system simulates the proof system $G_1$, which allows limited reasoning with QBFs and forms the first level above ER in a natural hierarchy of proof systems. This hierarchy is not known to be strict, but nevertheless this is evidence that the system of [Bogaerts et al. 2023] is plausibly strictly stronger than ER and DRAT. In the other direction, we show that symmetry-breaking for a single symmetry can be handled inside ER.</description>

      <title>Atomic Toposes with Co-Well-Founded Categories of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atoms of the Schanuel topos can be described as the pairs $(n,G)$ where $n$ is a finite set and $G$ is a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(n)$. We give a general criterion on an atomic site ensuring that the atoms of the topos of sheaves on that site can be described in a similar fashion. We deduce that these toposes are locally finitely presentable. By applying this to the Malitz-Gregory atomic topos, we obtain a counter-example to the conjecture that every locally finitely presentable topos has enough points. We also work out a combinatorial property satisfied exactly when the sheaves for the atomic topology are the pullback-preserving functors. In this case, the category of atoms is particularly simple to describe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. The purpose of this paper is to lift that framework from universal algebra to the strictly more expressive setting of full first-order logic. We show that the so-obtained logic-based framework preserves all desired properties and we prove novel results in that extended setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cellular-Lindel\"of property is a common generalization of the Lindel\"of property and the countable chain condition that was introduced by Bella and Spadaro in 2018. We solve two questions of Alas, Gutierrez-Dominguez and Wilson by constructing consistent examples of a normal almost cellular-Lindel\"of space which is neither cellular-Lindel\"of nor weakly Lindel\"of and a Tychonoff cellular-Lindel\"of space of Lindel\"of degree $\omega_1$ and uncountable weak Lindel\"of degree for closed sets. We also construct a ZFC example of a space for which both the cellular-Lindel\"of property and normality are undetermined in ZFC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of infinite discrete sets D definable in expansions of ordered Abelian groups whose theories are strong and definably complete, with particular emphasis on the set D' comprised of differences between successive elements. In particular, if the burden of the structure is at most n, then the result of applying the operation taking D to D' n times must be a finite set (Theorem 1.1). In the case when the structure is densely ordered and has burden 2, we show that any definable unary discrete set must be definable in some elementary extension of the structure (R; &lt;, +, Z) (Theorem 1.3).</description>

Abstract: We answer a question of Krueger by obtaining disjoint stationary sequences on successive cardinals. The main idea is an alternative presentation of a mixed support iteration, using it even more explicitly as a variant of Mitchell forcing. We also use a Mahlo cardinal to obtain a model in which $\aleph_2 \notin I[\aleph_2]$ and there is no disjoint stationary sequence on $\aleph_2$, answering a question of Gilton.</description>

      <title>The finite frame property of some extensions of the pure logic of necessitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite frame property of some extensions of Fitting, Marek, and Truszczy\'nski's pure logic of necessitation $\mathbf{N}$. For any natural numbers $m, n$, we introduce the logic $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m, n}$ by adding the single axiom scheme $\Box^n \varphi \to \Box^m \varphi$ and the rule $\dfrac{\neg \Box \varphi}{\neg \Box \Box \varphi}$ (Ros$^\Box$) into $\mathbf{N}$. We prove the finite frame property of $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m, n}$ with respect to Fitting, Marek, and Truszczy\'nski's relational semantics. We also prove that for $n \ge 2$, the logic obtained by removing the rule Ros$^\Box$ from $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{0, n}$ is incomplete with respect to that semantics.</description>

      <title>Quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth in doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims at providing a first step towards a doctrinal approach to quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth modulo a first-order theory.
  The set of quantifier-free formulas modulo a first-order theory is axiomatized by what we call a quantifier-free fragment of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Rather than being an intrinsic notion, a quantifier-free fragment is an additional structure on a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Under a smallness assumption, the structures occurring as quantifier-free fragments of some Boolean doctrines with quantifiers are precisely the Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers). To obtain this characterization, we prove that every Boolean doctrine over a small base category admits a quantifier completion, of which it is a quantifier-free fragment.
  Furthermore, the stratification by quantifier alternation depth of first-order formulas motivates the introduction of quantifier alternation stratified Boolean doctrines. While quantifier-free fragments are defined in relation to an "ambient" Boolean doctrine with quantifiers, a quantifier alternation stratified Boolean doctrine requires no such ambient doctrine. Indeed, it consists of a sequence of Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers) with connecting axioms. We show such sequences to be in one-to-one correspondence with pairs consisting of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers and a quantifier-free fragment of it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a class C of finite Kripke frames, we consider the uniform distribution on the frames from C with n states. A formula is almost surely valid in C if the probability that it is valid in a random C-frame with n states tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. The formulas that are almost surely valid in C form a normal modal logic. We find complete and sound axiomatizations for the logics of almost sure validities in the classes of finite frames defined by the logics K5, KD5, K45, KD45, K5B, S5, Grz.3, and GL.3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem (such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$). We prove the undecidability of all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts, that such a result fails for SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. For $G$ amenable we prove that topological entropy is not computable from presentations of SFTs, and a more general result for dynamical invariants taking values in partially ordered sets.</description>
