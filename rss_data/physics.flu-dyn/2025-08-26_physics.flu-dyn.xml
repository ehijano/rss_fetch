      <title>Buckling activated translation of encapsulated microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of initial shape imperfections on the post-buckling and translational behavior of encapsulated microbubbles is investigated subject to acoustic excitation in an unbounded flow. Bifurcation analysis reveals that imperfections lower the critical overpressure for buckling, guiding the bubble along stable branches with transitions influenced by the nature of the imperfections. The resulting branches emerge as unfoldings of bifurcation diagrams and closely resemble solution families emanating from the standard bifurcation diagram of a perfect sphere. Dynamic simulations for fixed forcing frequency demonstrate that the microbubble buckles at the defective pole and at maximum compression adopts the shape corresponding to the buckled shape that emerges in the static bifurcation diagram for the same pressure disturbance. Simulations further reveal that the deformed microbubble exhibits translational motion in the direction of concavity, driven by the balance between pressure and viscous drag, both aligned with this motion as a result of the deformed shape acquired by the microbubble. The translational speed is highly dependent on the shell stretching and bending elasticities and forcing frequency, with an optimal speed achieved when the forcing frequency equals the difference between the resonance frequencies of the initial shape and the compressed static shape corresponding to the imposed sound amplitude. Higher sound amplitude or lower bending resistance lead to more pronounced deformations that enhance translational motion. The impact of this dynamic response pattern on the recently reported translational motion of properly engineered coated microbubbles to act as microswimmers in modern drug delivery modalities under ultrasound excitation, is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonlinear aerodynamics models with certifiably optimal boundedness properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining predictive low-order models is a central challenge in fluid dynamics. Data-driven frameworks have been widely used to obtain low-order models of aerodynamic systems; yet, resulting models tend to yield predictions that grow unbounded with time. Recently introduced stability-promoting methods can facilitate the identification of bounded models, but tend to require extensive brute-force tuning even in the context of simple academic systems. Here, we show how recent theoretical advances in the long-term boundedness of dynamical systems can be integrated into data-driven modeling frameworks to ensure that resulting models will yield bounded predictions of incompressible flows. Specifically, we propose to solve a specific set of convex semi-definite programming problems to (i) certify whether a system admits a globally attracting bounded set for the chosen modeling parameters, and (ii) compute a model with the optimal (tightest) bound on this globally attracting set. We demonstrate the approach via integration within the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) modeling framework. Application on two low-order benchmark problems establishes the merits of the approach. We then apply our approach to obtain a low-order (6-mode) model of unsteady separation over a NACA-65(1)-412 airfoil at Re = 20, 0000, a flow that has been notoriously difficult to model using data-driven methods. The resulting model is found to accurately predict the dynamics of unsteady separation, with model predictions remaining bounded indefinitely. We anticipate this work will benefit future efforts in modeling strongly nonlinear flows, especially in settings where physically-viable long-term forecasts are paramount.</description>

      <title>A Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Model for Nanoscale Surfactant-laden Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multispecies diffuse interface model is formulated in a fluctuating hydrodynamics framework for the purpose of simulating surfactant interfaces at the nanoscale. The model generalizes previous work to ternary mixtures, employing a Cahn-Hilliard free energy density combined with incompressible, isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamics where dissipative fluxes include both deterministic and stochastic terms. The intermolecular parameters in the free energy are chosen such that one species acts as a partially miscible surfactant. From Laplace pressure measurements we show that in this model the surface tension decreases linearly with surfactant concentration, leading to Marangoni convection for interfaces with concentration gradients. In the capillary wave spectrum for interfaces with and without surfactant we find that for the former the spectrum deviates significantly from classical capillary wave theory, presumably due to Gibbs elasticity. In non-equilibrium simulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, deterministic simulations showed that the surfactant delays pinching of a fluid cylinder into droplets. However, stochastic simulations indicate that thermal fluctuations disrupt the surfactant's stabilizing effect. Similarly, the spreading of a patch of surfactant, driven by Marangoni convection, was found to be partially suppressed by thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Subtleties of UV-crosslinking in microfluidic particle fabrication: UV dosage and intensity matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curable hydrogels have tunable properties that make them well-suited for applications in drug delivery, cell therapies, and 3D bioprinting. Advances in microfluidic droplet generation enable rapid fabrication of polymer-filled droplets. UV-curable polymers offer a clear path toward using fluidic generation to produce monodisperse microgels with uniform properties. In flow, polymer concentration and UV exposure both control the degree of crosslinking. High UV intensity is often used to ensure complete gelation and avoid complications that may arise from partial curing. Optical microscopy can assess droplet and particle sizes in flow. However, optimizing formulations for mechanical properties usually requires removal of generated material and external measurement outside of flow. In this study, we couple droplet generation, microgel fabrication, and mechanics assessment within a single fluidic device. We make and measure soft polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) microgels by curing polymer-filled water drops in mineral oil. Crosslinking is tuned by varying UV dosage, allowing us to study how gelation degree influences microgel properties. Within the device, we use shape deformation in flow to measure the restoring stress of both droplets and particles. Our results suggest that PEGDA droplets gel from the inside out. If gelation is incomplete, a particle resides within a fluid drop. Independent measurements outside of flow corroborate this observation. Crosslinking PEGDA-filled droplets in a pendant drop geometry, with dye, suggests the persistence of an aqueous shell around the gel. Similarly, microparticles in PEGDA-filled drops undergoing gelation exhibit diffusive arrest near the drop center, while maintaining mobility in an outer region. Together, these results suggest the importance of considering the extent of gelation when fabricating microgels using fluidics.</description>

      <title>The compressible Neural Particle Method for Simulating Compressible Viscous Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking. However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks. The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step, and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility. The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking problem.</description>

      <title>Dimensional dependence of synchronisation in turbulence: insights from data assimilation and Lyapunov analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence, large-scale turbulent flows inevitably determine small-scale flows. Previous studies using data assimilation with the three-dimensional NS equations indicate that employing observational data resolved down to a specific length scale, $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, enables the successful reconstruction of small-scale flows. Such a length scale of `essential resolution of observation' for reconstruction $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$ is close to the dissipation scale in three-dimensional NS turbulence. Here we study the equivalent length scale in two-dimensional NS turbulence, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$, and compare with the three-dimensional case. Our numerical studies using data assimilation and conditional Lyapunov exponents reveal that, for Kolmogorov flows with Ekman drag, the length scale $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ is actually close to the forcing scale, substantially larger than the dissipation scale. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the significant relative difference between the length scales, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ and $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, based on inter-scale interactions and orbital instabilities in turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>An improved lattice Boltzmann method with a novel conservative boundary scheme for viscoelastic fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high Weissenberg number problem has been a persistent challenge in the numerical simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows. This paper presents an improved lattice Boltzmann method for solving viscoelastic flow problems at high Weissenberg numbers. The proposed approach employs two independent two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann models to solve the hydrodynamic field and conformation tensor field of viscoelastic fluid flows, respectively. The viscoelastic stress computed from the conformation tensor is directly embedded into the hydrodynamic field using a newly proposed local velocity discretization scheme, thereby avoiding spatial gradient calculations. The constitutive equations are treated as convection-diffusion equations and solved using an improved convection-diffusion model specifically designed for this purpose, incorporating a novel auxiliary source term that eliminates the need for spatial and temporal derivative computations. Additionally, a conservative non-equilibrium bounce-back (CNEBB) scheme is proposed for implementing solid wall boundary conditions in the constitutive equations. The robustness of the present algorithm is validated through a series of benchmark problems. The simplified four-roll mill problem demonstrates that the method effectively improves numerical accuracy and stability in bulk regions containing stress singularities. The Poiseuille flow problem validates the accuracy of the current algorithm with the CNEBB boundary scheme at extremely high Weissenberg numbers (tested up to Wi = 10,000). The flow past a circular cylinder problem confirms the superior stability and applicability of the algorithm for complex curved boundary problems compared to other existing common schemes.</description>

      <title>Impact of boiling liquid droplets: Vapor entrapment suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There hardly is a fluid mechanics phenomenon attracting more attention than the impact of a droplet, due to its undeniable beauty, many applications and the numerous challenges it poses. One of the crucial factors turns out to be the cushioning effect of the gas surrounding the droplet. This fact, together with the observation that almost all of the relevant literature was done in air, triggers the question what would happen when the liquid was a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, as is the case during transport of cryogenic liquids such as liquid hydrogen. To investigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in thermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that minute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase change. Using a frustrated total internal reflection (TIR) setup, we make the exciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions, the entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid conditions. We create a simplified model based on scaling arguments and perform numerical simulations considering both the compressible and condensable properties of the vapor layer that are in very good agreement with our experimental findings. Our results can be of great consequence to the pressures exerted during droplet impact and on an industrial scale may help better understand the loads experienced during sloshing wave impact inside cryogenic liquid containers.</description>

      <title>Open-source BOS tomography dataset of high-speed flow over a flight body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source background-oriented schlieren dataset with 70 views of high-speed flow over a flight body. Sample analyses are performed using a neural-implicit reconstruction technique (NIRT) with total variation regularization as well as data assimilation via the 3D compressible Euler equations. Limited-data reconstructions based on nine views resolve sharp shocks consistent with the geometry, reproduce validation deflections with high fidelity, and exhibit minimal artifacts. Data assimilation recovers unmeasured fields, marking the first experimental demonstration of 3D state estimation directly from experimental schlieren measurements. The NIRT also enables efficient uncertainty quantification, providing insight into well-resolved flow features and guiding design-of-experiments efforts. Public access to the data and code repositories is detailed at the end of this correspondence.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DSMC simulations of rarefied gas mixtures using a fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of rarefied gas mixture dynamics with disparate masses using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is slow, primarily because the time step is constrained by that of the lighter species, necessitating an enormous number of evolution steps to reach a steady state. Here, we address this issue by developing a general synthetic iterative scheme, in which the traditional DSMC simulation is intermittently enhanced using a macroscopic synthetic equation. Specifically, after running the DSMC for a certain number of time steps, the high-order constitutive relations for stress and heat flux, as well as the momentum and energy exchange terms from inter-species collisions, are extracted from the DSMC and incorporated into the macroscopic synthetic equations. These equations are solved to obtain the steady state, and the solution is then used to update the particle distribution in DSMC, thereby skipping unnecessary intermediate evolutions. This two-way coupling not only accelerates convergence to the steady state but also asymptotically preserves the Navier-Stokes limit in the continuum flow regime, allowing the spatial cell size to be much larger than the molecular mean free path. The accuracy of our method is validated for one-dimensional force-driven Poiseuille flow and two-dimensional hypersonic flow past cylinders, considering Maxwell and hard-sphere gases with mass ratios of 10 and 100. Although our in-house DSMC method is approximately an order of magnitude slower than the open-source DSMC code SPARTA, intermittently augmenting it with the synthetic equation makes it roughly 30 times faster at a Knudsen number of 0.01, with even greater computational gains anticipated at smaller Knudsen numbers. This work represents a critical step toward developing fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving schemes for hypersonic chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reversals in a geodynamo model with a stably-stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals. Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Bursting of columnar structures in forced rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report intermittent bursting of cyclonic columnar structures in direct numerical simulations of forced rotating turbulence in a three-dimensional (3D) periodic box. Columnar structure formation is associated with dominant inverse cascade of energy in addition to the typical forward cascade at large wavenumbers. The forcing is random and isotropic, applied in two distinct wavenumber bands (kf = [3, 4] and [6, 7]). Notably, bursting is observed only for small forcing wavenumber, kf = [3, 4] and not at kf = [6, 7], for the same rotation rate and initial conditions. These bursting events are associated with forward cascade of energy in contrast to the inverse cascade of rotating turbulence, as confirmed from the ring spectrum and time-series of modal kinetic energy of modes with kz = 2, 3. Identifying some of the triads involved in the energy transfer from modal analysis, we also calculate the mode-to-mode energy transfer. We find that, before the event, the circular cyclonic vortex becomes elliptical due to cyclone-anticyclone interactions leading to elliptical instability. We argue that energy transfer preceding the bursting events to modes with higher kz triggers the Crow instability. These instabilities ultimately lead to bursting of the columnar vortex, which subsequently forms again due to the external rotation. Our results portray a tug-of-war between the destabilizing effect of elliptical instability and the stabilizing effect of external rotation.</description>

      <title>Deterioration of water evaporation by impurity accumulation at the liquid-vapor interface during nucleate boiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interfacial resistance to evaporation, in particular for the case of water, is a longstanding issue. The previous data on its main characterizing parameter, the accommodation coefficient, manifest a dispersion over three orders of magnitude. We study the evaporation of a thin liquid layer (microlayer) under the growing single bubble in saturated pool boiling of ultra-pure water at atmospheric pressure. However, the water contamination during the experiment cannot be excluded. The local and instantaneous data on interfacial thermal resistance are recovered from the synchronous local measurements of the microlayer thickness and the heater temperature. At each particular interfacial point, the resistance shows a linear increase in time suggesting the effect of accumulation of impurities at the interface. We compute the water mass evaporated at a given point of microlayer that should be proportional to the interfacial concentration of accumulated impurities. A clear increase of the interfacial thermal resistance with the evaporated mass is observed. This demonstrates a link of the temporal increase of the interfacial resistance (i.e. the evaporation deterioration) with the accumulation of impurities at the interface, which can explain the dispersion of the published data on the accommodation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion in axially strained tube flows: Large-time asymptotics and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17982v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion of a passive scalar in an axially strained flow in a slender tube is studied, with particular focus on large-time asymptotics following the approach of~\cite{rajamanickam2020dispersion}. For times exceeding the cross-sectional diffusion timescale, the scalar field forms an axial (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck) Gaussian profile whose variance increases exponentially with the local axial strain, which itself varies with radial location, while radial diffusion only slowly modulates the overall amplitude. In other words, the scalar is dominated by strong axial stretching, completely overwhelming radial diffusion. In striking contrast to classical Taylor dispersion, where radial diffusion rapidly homogenizes the profile and axial convection appears only as a small correction, here axial stretching governs the dominant dynamics, producing a fundamentally different transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>(3+1)-dimensional compressible fluid as a (4+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluid described by an Abelian Chern-Simons action principle in 4+1 dimensions is considered. Letting 3+1 dimensions correspond to the usual space and time, and assuming the fields to be independent of the fifth coordinate, the free theory provides an interpretation as a system of advection equations, where the advecting velocity field is defined as the null vector of the field strength tensor (curvature). The free theory possesses a number of conservation laws which turn out to be prototypical forms of helicity and entropy conservation. Coupling the Chern-Simons field to an external source, a new conserved charge density is obtained which has the form of the Rossby-Ertel's potential vorticity (PV). Finally, by identifying the external current with the Chern-Simons field in a gauge-invariant setting, based on non-relativistic ideas, a self-interacting action principle is obtained whose Euler-Lagrange equations correspond precisely to a classical dissipationless compressible (3+1)-dimensional fluid endowed with thermodynamics, with only one extra condition: a constraint on the initial profile of the PV. After analysing this constraint of the "Chern-Simons fluid formulation", we investigate the helicity conservation of general fluids, going beyond classical analyses of barotropic fluids and no-cross boundary conditions for vorticity (Moffatt 1969). A new fluid helicity invariant for barotropic fluids under generic boundary conditions is obtained and the role of baroclinity in the helicity production is clarified. Inside a region bounded by an isentropic surface, the theory's constraint on the PV gives an integral formula for the mass, and for the evolution of fluid helicity in the baroclinic case. Finally, for an ideal gas exact, steady solutions of the equations of motion are found in a rotating scenario, showing that Ferrel-cell like patterns are produced in a rotating planet.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Vorticity and Viscous Stress in Finite Scale Quantum Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Madelung equations offer a hydrodynamic description of quantum systems, from single particles to quantum fluids. In this formulation, the probability density is mapped onto the fluid density and the phase is treated as a scalar potential generating the velocity field. As examples of potential flows, quantum fluids described in this way are inherently irrotational, but quantum vortices may arise at discrete points where the phase is undefined. In this paper, starting from this irrotational description of a quantum fluid, a coarse-graining procedure is applied to arrive at a macroscopic description of the quantum fluid in which the role of velocity is played by a Favre average of the microscopic velocity field, allowing for finite vorticity at any point in the fluid. It is shown that this vorticity obeys a similar equation to the vorticity equation in classical hydrodynamics and includes a vortex-stretching term. This coarse-graining procedure also gives rise to novel stress terms in the fluid equations, which in the appropriate limit appear analogous to artificial viscous stresses from computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uncertain data assimilation for urban wind flow simulations with OpenLB-UQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of urban wind flow is essential for urban planning, pedestrian safety, and environmental management. Yet, it remains challenging due to uncertain boundary conditions and the high cost of conventional CFD simulations. This paper presents the use of the modular and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework OpenLB-UQ for urban wind flow simulations. We specifically use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled with a stochastic collocation (SC) approach based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). The framework introduces a relative-error noise model for inflow wind speeds based on real measurements. The model is propagated through a non-intrusive SC LBM pipeline using sparse-grid quadrature. Key quantities of interest, including mean flow fields, standard deviations, and vertical profiles with confidence intervals, are efficiently computed without altering the underlying deterministic solver. We demonstrate this on a real urban scenario, highlighting how uncertainty localizes in complex flow regions such as wakes and shear layers. The results show that the SC LBM approach provides accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions with significant computational efficiency, making OpenLB-UQ a practical tool for real-time urban wind analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study flows induced in a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. A catalytic reaction on the surfaces drives the diffusiophoretic flow of viscous fluid in the whole domain. We show that phoretically active sectors can generate eddies in the corner, similar to Moffatt eddies, induced mechanically in a similar confinement. We analyse the exact solution of the diffusion problem in the wedge geometry, coupled to diffusiophoretic flow generation in the slip-velocity formulation, to ultimately arrive at the stream function of the flow. We discuss cases in which simple exact solutions for the flow are available. Our work can inspire the design of microscale mixing devices involving dead-end pores in microfluidic devices and can serve as benchmarks for numerical solutions for complex geometries in (diffusio)phoretic systems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of 2D flat-sheet membrane filters for constant-pressure water purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane filtration is widely used in wastewater treatment to remove foulants from contaminated water. Foulant build-up on the membrane occludes the area open for fluid flow, which impairs the efficiency of the filtration operation by decreasing the flux through the membrane. This necessitates the introduction of cleaning interventions to regenerate the membrane after fouling. Backwashing is a strategy to restore the membrane, wherein clean water is processed backward through the membrane to dislodge attached foulants. We develop a Monte Carlo model based on physical parameters to simulate constant-pressure forward filtration and backwashing through dead-end, flat-sheet membranes, with membrane fouling dominated by intermediate blocking. We validate our model against real-world experiments and show good agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations. The newly developed model can be used to further investigate the impact of varying backwashing duration, frequency, and/or pressure on the rate of flux recovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>

      <title>Convection in a Rapidly Rotating Spherical Shell: Newton's Method Using Implicit Coriolis Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geophysical flows are characterized by rapid rotation. Simulating these flows requires small timesteps to achieve stability and accuracy. Numerical stability can be greatly improved by the implicit integration of the terms that are most responsible for destabilizing the numerical scheme. We have implemented an implicit treatment of the Coriolis force in a rotating spherical shell driven by a radial thermal gradient. We modified the resulting timestepping code to carry out steady-state solving via Newton's method, which has no timestepping error. The implicit terms have the effect of preconditioning the linear systems, which can then be rapidly solved by a matrix-free Krylov method. We computed the branches of rotating waves with azimuthal wavenumbers ranging from 4 to 12. As the Ekman number (the non-dimensionalized inverse rotation rate) decreases, the flows are increasingly axially independent and localized near the inner cylinder, in keeping with well-known theoretical predictions and previous experimental and numerical results. The advantage of the implicit over the explicit treatment also increases dramatically with decreasing Ekman numbers, reducing the cost of computation by as much as a factor of 20 for Ekman numbers of order of $10^{-5}$. We carried out continuation for both the Rayleigh and Ekman numbers and obtained interesting branches in which the drift velocity remained unchanged between pairs of saddle-node bifurcations.</description>

      <title>LatentFlow: Cross-Frequency Experimental Flow Reconstruction from Sparse Pressure via Latent Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study, we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder ($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the $p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in data-constrained experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Out-of-Training Uncertainty of Neural-Network based Turbulence Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of $2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$. Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP &gt; DE &gt; SV I &gt; MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates, despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational complexity for each training step</description>

      <title>Parallel Nodal Interior-Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for the Subsonic Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations: Applications to Vortical Flows and VIV Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes system, designed for applications of technological and industrial interest in the subsonic region. More precisely, this work aims to exploit the DG-discretised Navier-Stokes for two dimensional vortex-induced vibration (VIV) problems allowing for high-order of accuracy. The numerical discretisation comprises a nodal DG method on triangular grids, that includes two types of numerical fluxes: 1) the Roe approximate Riemann solver flux for non-linear advection terms, and 2) an Interior-Penalty numerical flux for non-linear diffusion terms. The nodal formulation permits the use of high order polynomial approximations without compromising computational robustness. The spatially-discrete form is integrated in time using a low-storage strong-stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, and is coupled weakly with an implicit rigid body dynamics algorithm. The proposed algorithm successfully implements polynomial orders of $p\ge 4$ for the laminar compressible Navier-Stokes equations in massively parallel architectures. The resulting framework is firstly tested in terms of its convergence properties. Then, numerical solutions are validated with experimental and numerical data for the case of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds number, and lastly, the methodology is employed to simulate the problem of an elastically-mounted cylinder, a known configuration characterised by significant computational challenges. The above results showcase that the DG framework can be employed as an accurate and efficient, arbitrary order numerical methodology, for high fidelity fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recent concept of fluids projected onto Log-Lattices, we investigate the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem (GCFT) in the context of fluid mechanics. The dynamics of viscous flows are inherently irreversible, which violates a fundamental assumption of the fluctuation theorem. To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction rate satisfies a large deviation relation which rate function can be estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shear-thinning fluids flowing through pipes are crucial in many practical applications, yet many unresolved problems remain regarding their turbulent transition. Using highly robust numerical tools for the Carreau-Yasuda model, we discovered that linear instability can arise when the power-law index falls below 0.35. This inelastic non-axisymmetric instability can universally arise in generalised Newtonian fluids that extend the power-law model. The viscosity ratio from infinite to zero shear rate can significantly impact instability, even if it is small. Two branches of finite-amplitude travelling wave solutions bifurcate subcritically from the linear critical point. The solutions exhibit sublaminar drag reduction, a phenomenon not possible in the Newtonian case.</description>

Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. The amplitude of initial perturbations, $Pm$ and domain aspect ratio play a key role in the onset and evolution of the dynamo. It exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in various astrophysical objects with small $Pm$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores decaying turbulence beneath surface waves that is initially isotropic and shear-free. We start by presenting phenomenology revealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular momentum in coherent vortices perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of depth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with rotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$, takes on the role of the background vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \beta y) \hat{\boldsymbol{z}}$ on the beta plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation model proposed by Bardina et al. (1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the simulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the two-equation model -- which explicitly parametrizes wave-driven suppression of kinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about a wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation model, which we term the "pseudovorticity number" after the pseudovorticity $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$. The pseudovorticity number is related to the Langmuir number in an integral sense.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous generation of helical flows by salt fingers</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of salt fingers in the regime of slow salinity diffusion (small inverse Lewis number) and strong stratification (large density ratio), focusing on regimes relevant to Earth's oceans. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations in periodic domains, we show that salt fingers exhibit rich, multiscale dynamics in this regime, with vertically elongated fingers that are twisted into helical shapes at large scales by mean flows and disrupted at small scales by isotropic eddies. We use a multiscale asymptotic analysis to motivate a reduced set of partial differential equations that filters internal gravity waves and removes inertia from all parts of the momentum equation except for the Reynolds stress that drives the helical mean flow. When simulated numerically, the reduced equations capture the same dynamics and fluxes as the full equations in the appropriate regime. The reduced equations enforce zero helicity in all fluctuations about the mean flow, implying that the symmetry-breaking helical flow is spontaneously generated by strictly non-helical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning in fluid dynamics: A critical assessment</title>

Abstract: The fluid dynamics community has increasingly adopted machine learning to analyze, model, predict, and control a wide range of flows. These methods offer powerful computational capabilities for regression, compression, and optimization. In some cases, machine learning has even outperformed traditional approaches. However, many fluid mechanics problems remain beyond the reach of current machine learning techniques. As the field moves from its current state toward a more mature paradigm, this article offers a critical assessment of the key challenges that must be addressed. Tackling these technical issues will not only deepen our understanding of flow physics but also expand the applicability of machine learning beyond fundamental research. We also highlight the importance of community-maintained datasets and open-source code repositories to accelerate progress in this area. Furthermore, the future success of machine learning in fluid dynamics will depend on effective training -- not only for the next generation of researchers but also for established fluid mechanicians adapting to this evolving landscape. Data-driven fluid dynamics is in its critical transitional state over the next few years to shape its future. This perspective article aims to spark discussions and encourage collaborative efforts to advance the integration of machine learning in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Taylor Dispersion of an Axisymmetric Brownian Particle with Center Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taylor dispersion, the gravity-induced enhancement of translational diffusion during the steady settling of a Brownian particle, has so far been analyzed only for torque-free bodies (H. Brenner, J. Colloid Interface Sci., 71(2): 189-208, 1979). In this work, we extend the theory to a non-centrosymmetric, axisymmetric particle whose centers of mass and buoyancy are offset from its hydrodynamic center, so that the gravitational torque acts in addition to the net gravitational force. We study the Taylor dispersion of such particles as a function of non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ representing the strength of the gravitational torque: $\alpha$ is zero when the centers of mass and buoyancy are at the hydrodynamic center and increases when they are offset from it. Analytical calculations show that for small $\alpha$, the Taylor dispersion is always amplified: the effective diffusivities created by sedimentation always increase as $\alpha^2$, but they start to decrease at certain values of $\alpha$ and approach to zero for large values of $\alpha$. We further analyze the transient regime of the mean-square displacement (MSD). At short times, the MSD grows quadratically with time before crossing over to the diffusive regime. The ballistic regime persists to relatively high sedimentation P\'eclet numbers (the ratio of the rotational relaxation time to the sedimentation time), even in the presence of a gravitational torque, indicating that such a torque does not considerably alter sustained ballistic motion.</description>
