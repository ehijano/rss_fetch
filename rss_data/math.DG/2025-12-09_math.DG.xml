      <title>Geometric properties of second Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduce the idea of second Ricci solitons. A second Ricci soliton is nothing but a steady hyperbolic Ricci soliton. We study the geometry of closed and compact second Ricci soliton manifolds. Immersed submanifolds as second solitons also will be investigated. Finally, we investigate this structure on warped product manifolds.</description>

      <title>Potential theory and applications in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we want to give an exposition of our recent work on linear and nonlinear potential theory and their applications in conformal geometry. We use potential theory to study linear and quasilinear equations arising from conformal geometry. We establish the asymptotic behavior near singularities and derive applications in conformal geometry. In particular, we establish some Huber's type theorems and Hausdorff dimension estimates of the ends in conformal geometry in general dimensions.</description>

      <title>Overdetermined Steklov eigenvalue problems on compact surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the overdetermined problem given by
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u=0 \mbox{ in } \Omega,\quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu} =\sigma_1 u \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega, \quad |\nabla u|=\mbox{constant on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a connected, orientable, compact Riemannian surface with smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$, and $\sigma_1$ is the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue of $\Omega$. We give a complete characterization of $\Omega$ when the overdetermined problem is solvable. Precisely, we prove that the overdetermined problem above admits a (nontrivial) solution if and only if $\Omega$ is conformally equivalent to either the flat unit disk or a flat cylinder $[-L,L]\times S^1$ for certain $L\ge L_0$ by a conformal transformation which (up to scaling) is an isometry on the boundary. In particular, we completely determine the compact domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or in $\mathbb{H}^2$ such that the overdetermined problem is solvable.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic min-max via phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a PDE-based approach to the min-max construction of nontrivial integer rectifiable varifolds that are stationary with respect to anisotropic surface energies on closed Riemannian manifolds, in codimension one. Specifically, we study the anisotropic analogue of the Allen-Cahn energy and establish a Modica-type gradient bound for its critical points. Using this in conjunction with certain estimates for stable solutions, we then prove that the energy densities of stable or bounded-Morse-index critical points of its rescalings concentrate along an integer rectifiable varifold that is stationary for the underlying anisotropic integrand. As a consequence, we construct a (possibly singular) anisotropic min-max hypersurface via Allen-Cahn, obtaining an analogue of the result of Hutchinson-Tonegawa in the anisotropic setting.</description>

      <title>Blown-up singular Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate new properties of the blow-up desingularization method in the context of singular Riemannian foliations. First, we relate the dynamics of such a foliation, which is governed by the so called Molino sheaf, with that of its blow-up. In the particular case of singular Killing foliations, this leads to a strong constraint under mild topological assumptions: namely, the leaves of such foliations are all closed, provided the Euler characteristic of its ambient manifold is non-vanishing and its singular strata are all odd-codimensional. Next, we relate the basic cohomology of a singular Riemannian foliation with that of its blow-up, generalizing well-known, classical analogous results in algebraic and complex geometry. Finally, we show that the space of leaf closures of a singular Killing foliation is the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of a sequence of orbifolds, whose dimensions are the codimension of the foliation.</description>

      <title>Higgs bundle, isomonodromic leaves and minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a gauge theoretic construction of the joint moduli space of stable G-Higgs bundles on closed Riemann surfaces, where the Riemann surface structure is allowed to vary in the Teichm\"uller space of the underlying smooth surface. This joint moduli space has many interesting structures that are preserved by the mapping class group of the surface. We describe a surprising relationship between four key objects: the isomonodromic foliation, a canonical hermitian form arising from the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic structure on the character variety, a canonical holomorphic form which vertically lifts vector fields on Teichm\"uller space, and the energy function for equivariant harmonic maps. One consequence of this work is the construction of pseudo-K\"ahler metrics on many examples of components of character varieties which include rank two higher Teichm\"uller spaces. This recovers some of the recent work on the subject by various authors.</description>

      <title>Isometric Embeddings of Conformally Compact Manifolds into Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Nash Embedding Theorem asserts that every closed Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into a sufficiently high-dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, we prove an analogous result in the conformally compact context. Let $\left(M,g\right)$ be a conformally compact manifold whose sectional curvature at infinity is strictly bounded below by a negative constant $-\lambda^{2}$. We prove that $\left(M,g\right)$ can be realized as a submanifold, transverse to the sphere at infinity, of a sufficiently high-dimensional rescaled hyperbolic space of constant curvature $-\lambda^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Mass and volume of four-dimensional Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M^4,\bar{g})$ be an Einstein manifold, where $M^4$ is a smooth, closed, oriented four-manifold $M^4$ and $\bar{g}$ has positive Einstein constant. Given a point $0 \in M^4$, let $G$ denote the (positive) Green's function $G$ of the conformal laplacian $L_{\bar{g}}$; then $g = G^2 \bar{g}$ is a complete, scalar-flat, asymptotically flat metric on $\widehat{M} = M \setminus \{ 0 \}$. We first show that the ADM mass of $g$ can be expressed as an integral over $\widehat{M}$, then use this identity to prove a lower bound for the mass of $g$ in terms of the volume of $\bar{g}$. As corollaries, we prove a 'mass times volume' inequality, plus various mass gap theorems characterizing the round metric on $S^4$ and the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{CP}^2$.</description>

      <title>The first nonzero eigenvalue of the weighted p-Laplacian on differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the weighted p-Laplace operator acting on differential forms on a metric measure space, which is a natural generalization of the p-Laplace operator defined by Seto [32]. We obtain some sharp lower bounds of the first nonzero eigenvalue for the weighted p-Laplacian. Our results extend an estimate of Seto [32], as well as the eigenvalue estimates derived by Cui-Sun [8] for closed submanifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rigidity of Ricci-flat manifolds with quadratic curvature decay under conditions on the Green function. We show that if the gradient of the Green function is uniformly bounded from below, then the manifold is flat. Furthermore, we prove that for a Ricci-flat manifold with quadratic curvature decay and Euclidean volume growth, the curvature is in $L^p$ for any $p \ge 2$. Combining with Cheeger-Tian \cite{CT} and Kr\"oncke-Szab\'o \cite{KS}, we obtain that the manifold must be ALE of optimal order.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates and Liouville properties for the drifted Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the validity of the Liouville property for $X$-harmonic functions, i.e. positive solution to $\Delta_{X}u=0$, where $X$ is a vector field on a complete, non-compact Riemannian manifold and $\Delta_{X}$ is the drifted Laplacian. In particular, we show that if the $X$-Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci curvature $\mathrm{Ric}_{X}$ is non-negative and the norm of $X$ decays to zero at infinity, then the manifold has the Liouville property for the $X$-Laplacian. The proof exploits a local gradient estimate for positive solutions to the semilinear equation $\Delta_{X}u+F(u)=0$, which holds when $F$ satisfies the structural conditions $tF'(t)-F(t)\le\alpha$ and $\vert F(t)\vert\le\beta t$, and the manifold has $\mathrm{Ric}_{X}\ge-(n-1)K$.</description>

      <title>A weighted Reilly type integral formula for differential forms and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a weighted Reilly type integral formula for differential forms on a compact smooth metric measure space with boundary. As applications, a lower bound of the spectrum for the weighted Hodge Laplacian acting on differential forms on the boundary, and some special properties for p-th absolute cohomology space with respect to the lowest p-curvatures of the boundary have been obtained, respectively. Furthermore, we obtain a lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue of the Steklov eigenvalue problem on differential forms which is related to the lowest principal curvature of the boundary, and a comparison result between the eigenvalues of the Steklov eigenvalue problem and the Hodge Laplacian on the boundary. On the other hand, for closed submanifolds of weighted Euclidean space, we derive universal inequalities for the sum of eigenvalues with respect to the weighted Hodge Laplacian, which can be seen as a generalization of Levitin-Parnovski inequality.</description>

      <title>Universal Hitchin moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study metric aspects of the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations as the complex structure $J$ varies over the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}$ of a closed surface $\Sigma$. Our approach is gauge theoretical and builds on the theory of K\"ahler fibrations and the moment map interpretation of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. Our first main result establishes that, over the moduli space of cscK metrics, the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations carries a natural complex structure together with a family of pseudo-K\"ahler metrics forming a K\"ahler fibration with a K\"ahler Ehresmann connection.
  We then investigate a second universal moduli space, constructed from the space of flat $G$-connections over $\mathcal{T}$, which admits a nontrivial $J$-dependent K\"ahler fibration structure discovered by Hitchin. Using symplectic reduction, we build universal moduli spaces of solutions to the harmonicity equations depending on a coupling constant $\alpha$, obtaining natural complex and pseudo-K\"ahler structures and an explicit K\"ahler potential. The main novelty here is that this moduli space is defined by a system coupling the scalar curvature with a cubic term in the Higgs field. Finally, we propose a conjectural relationship between the two resulting families of moduli spaces in the weak-coupling limit $\alpha\to 0$, inspired by the twistor geometry of Hitchin's hyperk\"ahler moduli space.</description>

      <title>Entropy--Smooth Structures on Topological Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework for smooth structures on topological manifolds, replacing coordinate charts with small-scale entropy data of local probability probes. A concise set of axioms identifies admissible coordinate functions and reconstructs a smooth atlas directly from the quadratic entropy response. We prove that this entropy-smooth structure is equivalent to the classical smooth structure, stable under perturbations, and compatible with products, submanifolds, immersions, and diffeomorphisms. This establishes smoothness as an information-theoretic phenomenon and forms the foundational layer of a broader program linking entropy, diffusion, and differential geometry.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any large enough $m \in\mathbb{N}$, the genus $\gamma=m+1$ equator-poles minimal surface doubling of the equatorial two-sphere $\Sigma^0 = \mathbb{S}^2_{\mathrm{eq}}$ in the round three-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, which has two catenoidal bridges at the poles and $m$ bridges equidistributed along the equatorial circle $\mathscr{C}$ of $\Sigma^0 $ and was discovered in earlier work of Kapouleas, has index $2\gamma+5=2m+7$ and nullity $6$, and so it has no exceptional Jacobi fields and is $C^1$-isolated.</description>

      <title>Boundary structure of gauge fields on asymptotically AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study boundary structure of asymptotically AdS gravity and (gauge) fields defined on this background by employing the gauge PDE approach. The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure. It can be considered as an extension of the Fefferman-Graham construction that takes into account both the leading and the subleading sector of the bulk fields.</description>

      <title>The topology of local quaternionic toric actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the topology of manifolds equipped with a local quaternionic toric action modeled on the regular representation of the quaternionic torus $Q^n=(S^3)^n$. Building on our previous work, where the toric, differential and tetraplectic foundations were established, we show that the global topology of such manifolds is determined by the orbit space and its characteristic data. We construct Leray--Serre and Atiyah--Hirzebruch spectral sequences for the orbit projection, yielding explicit descriptions of the cohomology and $K$-theory of manifolds equipped with local quaternionic toric actions. In dimension four, we develop a quaternionic analogue of the Meyer signature formula and we briefly outline an $L$-theoretic interpretation of the resulting signature invariants. These results extend the methods of the classical (complex) toric topology to the quaternionic setting.</description>

      <title>Caustics in the spherically symmetric Einstein-dust system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caustics-envelopes formed by the trajectories of fluid particles-arise in proposed dynamical extensions for shell-crossing singularities occurring in the Einstein-dust system. In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{\mu\nu})$ containing a caustic $\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study compact quotients of a Riemannian product $\mathbb{R}^q \times (N, g_N)$, where $(N, g_N)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold, by discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{Sim}(\mathbb{R}^q) \times \mathrm{Isom}(N)$. When $N$ is a symmetric space of non-compact type, this construction generalizes the well-known Inoue--Bombieri surfaces. We show that this setting is actually equivalent to that of the so-called LCP manifolds, and we establish a Bieberbach-type rigidity result in the case where $N$ is symmetric. In addition, we provide a classification of the manifolds $N$ and the groups $\Gamma$ when $N$ is a Hadamard manifold with strictly negative curvature.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed connected spin manifold. Index theory provides a topological lower bound on the dimension of the kernel of the Dirac operator which depends on the choice of Riemannian metric. Riemannian metrics for which this bound is attained are called Dirac-minimal. We show that the space of Dirac-minimal metrics on $M$ is connected if $M$ is of dimension 2 or 4.</description>

Abstract: We study compact locally conformally K\"ahler (lcK) manifolds which are Calabi--Yau, in the sense that $c_1^{BC}(X)=0$. First of all, we prove that all the known lcK manifolds which are Calabi--Yau are Vaisman. Then we prove that an lcK Chern--Ricci flat metric that is Gauduchon is necessarily Vaisman. Finally, specializing to Calabi--Yau solvmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure, we prove that a left-invariant metric is lcK if and only if it is Vaisman. Therefore, they are finite quotients of the Kodaira manifold.</description>

      <title>Marked Poincar\'e rigidity near hyperbolic metrics and injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian in dimension 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold without boundary equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ of negative curvature. In this paper, we introduce the marked Poincar\'e determinant (MPD), a homothety invariant of $g$ depending on differentiable periodic data of its geodesic flow. The MPD associates to each free homotopy class of closed curves in $M$ a number which measures the unstable volume expansion of the geodesic flow along the associated closed geodesic. We prove a local MPD rigidity result in dimension 3: if $g$ is sufficiently close to a hyperbolic metric $g_0$ and both metrics have the same MPD, then they are homothetic. As a by-product of our proof, we show the Lichnerowicz Laplacian of $g_0$ is injective on the space of trace-free divergence-free symmetric 2-tensors, which, to our knowledge, is the first result of its kind in negative curvature.</description>

Abstract: The Delaunay metrics form a family of conformally flat, constant fractional Q-curvature metrics on a twice-punctured sphere. They are all (after a M\"obius transformation) rotationally symmetric and periodic, and admit several elegant variational descriptions. We prove that, when s is close to but less than 1, any complete, conformally flat constant Q-curvature metric on a twice-punctured sphere is a Delaunay metric. Along the way, we prove a sharp a priori bound for the conformal factor of these metrics, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the complex structures of complete hyperk\"ahler four-manifolds of infinite topological type arising from the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz. We show that for almost all complex structures in the hyperk\"ahler family, the manifold is biholomorphic to a hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^3$ defined by an explicit entire function. For the remaining complex structures, we further prove that the manifold is biholomorphic to the minimal resolution of a singular surface in $\mathbb{C}^3$ under certain conditions. Thus, we partially extend LeBrun's celebrated work to the context of countably many punctures.</description>

Abstract: Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a hyperkahler manifold $M$, with $c_1(L)$ nef and not big. SYZ conjecture predicts that $L$ is semiample. We prove that this is true, assuming that $(M,L)$ has a deformation $(M',L')$ with $L'$ semiample. We introduce a version of the Teichmuller space that parametrizes pairs $(M,L)$ up to isotopy. We prove a version of the global Torelli theorem for such Teichmuller spaces and use it to deduce the deformation invariance of semiampleness.</description>

For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides with the union of all local Landau levels of the operator at the points of $X$. Moreover, if the union of the local Landau levels over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete. The main result of the paper is the trace asymptotics formula associated with these eigenvalues. As a consequence, we get a Weyl type asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue counting function.</description>

      <title>On global rigidity of transversely holomorphic Anosov flows</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study transversely holomorphic flows, i.e. those whose holonomy pseudo-group is given by biholomorphic maps. We prove that for Anosov flows on smooth compact manifolds, the strong unstable (respectively, stable) distribution is integrable to complex manifolds, on which the flow acts holomorphically. Furthermore, assuming its complex dimension to be one, it is uniquely integrable to complex affine one-dimensional manifolds, each moreover affinely diffeomorphic to $\mathbb C$, on which the flow acts affinely. In this case, the weak stable (respectively, unstable) foliation is transversely holomorphic, and even transversely projective if the flow is assumed to be topologically transitive. By combining these facts in low dimensions, our main result is as follows : if a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth compact five-dimensional manifold is topologically transitive, then it is either $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing invariants in $G$-equivariant birational geometry by unifying two recent approaches: the theory of atoms recently developed by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, and the theory of modular symbols due to Kontsevich, Tschinkel, and Pestun.
  We initiate the theory of Chen-Ruan atoms. Assuming the blowup formula for the quantum Chen-Ruan cohomology, we outline how to extend the theory of atoms to global quotient orbifolds and present some striking applications.
  In addition, we develop a separate class of purely geometric invariants for $\mathbb{Z}/2$- and $\mathbb{Z}/3$-actions on surfaces and threefolds.
  We provide many examples of non-$G$-linearizable $G$-actions on projective varieties treated with these new techniques.</description>

      <title>Staying on the Manifold: Geometry-Aware Noise Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several strategies of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalisation and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to data manifolds approximated by generative models and we observe similar trends on the MNIST digits dataset.</description>
