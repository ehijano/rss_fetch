      <title>Low-Cost Wideband Tilted Beam Antenna for Millimeter-wave Vehicle Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate vehicle coverage for millimeter-wave applications, this communication presents a low-cost, wideband tilted-beam antenna. A novel design is proposed in which a slot antenna is both directly excited and electromagnetically coupled to a monopole array. This slot-monopole configuration is inherently robust against substrate losses, enabling low-cost fabrication while maintaining high realized gain and compact size. Furthermore, the slot-fed structure effectively excites multiple resonant modes within the monopole array, resulting in a significantly enhanced bandwidth. Experimental results demonstrate that the antenna achieves a -10-dB impedance bandwidth of over 76.5% (20-44.78 GHz) and a peak realized gain of 6.1 dBi.</description>

      <title>Graph signal aware decomposition of dynamic networks via latent graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics on and of networks refer to changes in topology and node-associated signals, respectively and are pervasive in many socio-technological systems, including social, biological, and infrastructure networks. Due to practical constraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a fraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only hinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution. Such aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying latent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally uncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a powerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution through low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically lack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node signals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and overlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic graph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear combination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint evolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we estimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures via alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a stationary point. Numerical results show that the proposed method recovers individually and collectively expressive latent graphs, outperforming both standard tensor-based decompositions and signal-based topology identification methods in reconstructing the missing network especially when observations are limited.</description>

      <title>Extended Spherical Geometry Algorithm for Spaceborne SAR Processing in Stripmap and TOPS Imaging Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spherical Geometry Algorithm (SGA) demonstrates superior capability in achieving efficient and precise spaceborne SAR image formation processing, even under challenging imaging conditions including non-linear radar trajectories and spherical Earth surface geometry. Nevertheless, the original SGA is specifically developed for spotlight SAR data processing and can't directly applied to processing spaceborne SAR data in other modes. In this paper, we first analyze the limitations of the SGA algorithm when applied to stripmap or TOPS mode SAR processing, and then propose an improved SGA algorithm which can process both stripmap and TOPS SAR data. Compared with the original algorithm, the new algorithm has two main differences. Firstly, in order to avoid undersampling during azimuth resampling in both modes, an instantaneous Doppler centroid removal process was added before azimuth interpolation processing by exploiting the endomorphism property of resampling operation. Secondly, the spectral analysis method used for the final step of azimuth compression in the original SGA has been replaced with a new matched filtering processing, which can avoid image aliasing in azimuth direction and improve computational efficiency. Measured real data processing results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Timing advance and Doppler shift estimation in LEO satellite networks: A recursive Bayesian study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite based non-terrestrial networks are a key theme of the upcoming 6G networks. These space networks are proposed to be used for high-mobility use-cases like airplanes and vehicles. The initial access process between a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE) involves timing advance (TA) value computation at the BS, requiring precise BS location information at the UE. It becomes more challenging in LEO satellite networks due to the fast moving LEO satellites and large pathloss, in addition to the mobile UE. This paper aims to compute the TA and Doppler shift experienced at the UE by modeling the joint system dynamics in a LEO satellite-mobile UE network through an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based recursive Bayesian framework. The framework accurately models the joint system dynamics by considering the LEO satellite acceleration. It constructs the Jacobian to linearize the inherent non-linearities present in the motion. Probabilistic insights regarding the state-update and propagation are also provided. The analytical framework factors in the limited satellite visibility at the UE and the satellite-UE geometry w.r.t. the earth center. The proposed framework is also useful when the satellite and UE clocks are not in sync, with the corresponding clock drift a function of the measured time difference of arrivals. Our results showcase the efficacy and robustness of the proposed EKF framework to estimate the TA and Doppler shift, even at very high UE speeds. The work is expected to be extremely useful in realizing LEO satellite based non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>Confidence Boosts Trust-Based Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication-based multi-robot systems open the door to cyberattacks that can disrupt safety and performance of collaborative robots. The physical channel supporting inter-robot communication offers an attractive opportunity to decouple the detection of malicious robots from task-relevant data exchange between legitimate robots. Yet, trustworthiness indications coming from physical channels are uncertain and must be handled with this in mind. In this paper, we propose a resilient protocol for multi-robot operation wherein a parameter {\lambda}t accounts for how confident a robot is about the legitimacy of nearby robots that the physical channel indicates. Analytical results prove that our protocol achieves resilient coordination with arbitrarily many malicious robots under mild assumptions. Tuning {\lambda}t allows a designer to trade between near-optimal inter-robot coordination and quick task execution; see Fig. 1. This is a fundamental performance tradeoff and must be carefully evaluated based on the task at hand. The effectiveness of our approach is numerically verified with experiments involving platoons of autonomous cars where some vehicles are maliciously spoofed.</description>

      <title>Hardware Limitations and Optimization Approach in 1-Bit RIS Design at 28 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation, offering unprecedented control over wave reflections compared to traditional metallic reflectors. By utilizing an array of tunable elements, RIS can steer and shape electromagnetic waves to enhance signal quality in wireless communication and radar systems. However, practical implementations face significant challenges due to hardware limitations and phase quantization errors. In this work, a 1-bit RIS prototype operating at 28 GHz is developed to experimentally evaluate the impact of hardware constraints on RIS performance. Unlike conventional studies that model RIS as an ideal phase-shift matrix, this study accounts for physical parameters that influence the actual reflection pattern. In particular, the presence of specular reflection due to hardware limitations is investigated. Additionally, the effects of phase quantization errors, which stem from the discrete nature of RIS elements, are analyzed, and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization is introduced to mitigate these errors. The proposed optimization strategy effectively reduces gain degradation at the desired angle caused by 1-bit quantization, enhancing the overall performance of RIS. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through measurements, underscoring the importance of advanced phase control techniques in improving the functionality of RIS.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Tasking over Rate-Limited Wireless Channels with Implicit Optimal Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the cooperative multi-task semantic communication framework (CMT-SemCom) introduced in [1], which divides the semantic encoder on the transmitter side into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs), to a more applicable design. Our proposed system model addresses real-world constraints by introducing a general design that operates over rate-limited wireless channels. Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint, represented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the density ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By applying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid learning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric machine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our framework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs variational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system's effectiveness in rate-constrained multi-task SemCom scenarios, highlighting its potential for enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Tram Positioning with Map-Enabled GNSS Data Reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to tackle the problem of tram localization through utilizing a custom processing of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observables and the track map. The method is motivated by suboptimal performance in dense urban environments where the direct line of sight to GNSS satellites is often obscured which leads to multipath propagation of GNSS signals. The presented concept is based upon the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and has linear complexity (with respect to the number of GNSS measurements) as opposed to some other techniques mitigating the multipath signal propagation. The technique is demonstrated both on a simulated example and real data. The root-mean-squared errors from the simulated ground truth positions show that the presented solution is able to improve performance compared to a baseline localization approach. Similar result is achieved for the experiment with real data, while treating orthogonal projections onto the tram track as the true position, which is unavailable in the realistic scenario. This proof-of-concept shows results which may be further improved with implementation of a bank-of-models method or $\chi^2$-based rejection of outlying GNSS pseudorange measurements.</description>

      <title>Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA) for Enabled Flexible PONs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the commercial deployment of 5G and the in-depth research of 6G, the demand for high-speed data services in the next-generation fiber optic access systems is growing increasingly. Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a research hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and low cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has difficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high spectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission technology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access (PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the low-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the high-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing the system capacity. PD-SDCMA supports higher-order modulation formats and more access groups, and is also compatible with the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture. The simulation results show that in a 25 km single-mode fiber system, compared with PD-NOMA and 3D-NOMA, PD-SDCMA can support more users and significantly reduce BER. This technology provides an efficient and low-cost solution for the evolution of Flexible PONs.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Multiuser Scheduling in MIMO-OFDM Systems with Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF) metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms, followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the specific criteria within a given scenario.</description>

      <title>Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning of Node-Wise Battery Dynamics in Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable, and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems, modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles. Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.</description>

      <title>5G Aero: A Prototyping Platform for Evaluating Aerial 5G Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of small-factor, 5G-enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has recently gained significant interest in various aerial and Industry 4.0 applications. However, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency 5G communication in aerial applications remains a critical and underexplored problem. This paper presents the 5th generation (5G) Aero, a compact UAV optimized for 5G connectivity, aimed at fulfilling stringent 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) requirements. We conduct a set of experiments in an indoor environment, evaluating the UAV's ability to establish high-throughput, low-latency communications in both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the 5G Aero meets the required 3GPP standards for Command and Control (C2) packets latency in both LoS and NLoS, and video latency in LoS communications and it maintains acceptable latency levels for video transmission in NLoS conditions. Additionally, we show that the 5G module installed on the UAV introduces a negligible 1% decrease in flight time, showing that 5G technologies can be integrated into commercial off-the-shelf UAVs with minimal impact on battery lifetime. This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the practical capabilities of current 5G networks to support advanced UAV operations in telecommunications, offering insights into potential enhancements and optimizations for UAV performance in 5G networks</description>

      <title>RadioDUN: A Physics-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Passive acoustic non-line-of-sight localization without a relay surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and localization of a source hidden outside the Line-of-Sight (LOS) traditionally rely on the acquisition of indirect signals, such as those reflected from visible relay surfaces such as floors or walls. These reflected signals are then utilized to reconstruct the obscured scene. In this study, we present an approach that utilize signals diffracted from an edge of an obstacle to achieve three-dimensional (3D) localization of an acoustic point source situated outside the LOS. We address two scenarios - a doorway and a convex corner - and propose a localization method for each of them. For the first scenario, we utilize the two edges of the door as virtual detector arrays. For the second scenario, we exploit the spectral signature of a knife-edge diffraction, inspired by the human perception of sound location by the head-related transfer function (HRTF). In both methods, knife-edge diffraction is utilized to extend the capabilities of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) acoustic sensing, enabling localization in environments where conventional relay-surface based approaches may be limited.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates for adaptive focused time-frequency transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution is a follow-up of a recent paper by the authors on adaptive, non-linear time-frequency transforms, focusing on the STFT based transforms. The adaptivity is provided by a focus function, that depends on the analyzed function or signal, and that adapts dynamically the time-frequency resolution of the analysis. Sticking to the continuous case setting, this work provides new stability results for the transform (stability with respect with the focus function). It also investigates in some details focus functions based upon regularized R{\'e}nyi entropies and show corresponding continuity results.</description>

      <title>Adapting to Heterophilic Graph Data with Structure-Guided Neighbor Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting structural information to guide GNNs.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Learning-based Geometry Point Cloud Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents novel solutions for the efficient and reliable transmission of point clouds over wireless channels for real-time applications. We first propose SEmatic Point cloud Transmission (SEPT) for small-scale point clouds, which encodes the point cloud via an iterative downsampling and feature extraction process. At the receiver, SEPT decoder reconstructs the point cloud with latent reconstruction and offset-based upsampling. A novel channel-adaptive module is proposed to allow SEPT to operate effectively over a wide range of channel conditions. Next, we propose OTA-NeRF, a scheme inspired by neural radiance fields. OTA-NeRF performs voxelization to the point cloud input and learns to encode the voxelized point cloud into a neural network. Instead of transmitting the extracted feature vectors as in SEPT, it transmits the learned neural network weights in an analog fashion along with few hyperparameters that are transmitted digitally. At the receiver, the OTA-NeRF decoder reconstructs the original point cloud using the received noisy neural network weights. To further increase the bandwidth efficiency of the OTA-NeRF scheme, a fine-tuning algorithm is developed, where only a fraction of the neural network weights are retrained and transmitted. Noticing the poor generality of the OTA-NeRF schemes, we propose an alternative approach, termed OTA-MetaNeRF, which encodes different input point clouds into the latent vectors with shared neural network weights. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed SEPT, OTA-NeRF and OTA-MetaNeRF schemes achieve superior or comparable performance over the conventional approaches, where an octree-based or a learning-based point cloud compression scheme is concatenated with a channel code. Finally, the run-time complexities are evaluated to verify the capability of the proposed schemes for real-time communications.</description>

      <title>Meta-DSP: A Meta-Learning Approach for Data-Driven Nonlinear Compensation in High-Speed Optical Fiber Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects in high-speed optical fiber systems fundamentally limit channel capacity. While traditional Digital Backward Propagation (DBP) with adaptive filters addresses these effects, its computational complexity remains impractical. Data-driven solutions like Filtered DBP (FDBP) reduce complexity but critically lack inherent generalization: Their nonlinear compensation capability cannot be naturally extended to new transmission rates or WDM channel counts without retraining on newly collected data. We propose Meta-DSP, a novel signal processing pipeline combining: (1) Meta-DBP, a meta-learning-based DBP model that generalizes across transmission parameters without retraining, and (2) XPM-ADF, a carefully engineered adaptive filter designed to address multi-channel nonlinear distortions. The system demonstrates strong generalization, learning from 40 Gbaud single-channel data and successfully applying this knowledge to higher rates (80/160 Gbaud) and multi-channel configurations (up to 21 channels). Experimental results show Meta-DSP improves Q-factor by 0.55 dB over CDC in challenging scenarios while reducing computational complexity 10$\times$ versus DBP. This work provides a scalable solution for nonlinear compensation in dynamic optical networks, balancing performance with practical computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Enhanced channel estimation for near-field IRS-aided multi-user MIMO system via a large deep residual network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the channel estimation (CE) of intelligent reflecting surface-aided near-field (NF) multi-user communication is investigated. Initially, the least square (LS) estimator and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for the estimated channel are designed, their mean square errors (MSEs) are derived, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation. Subsequently, in view of the fact that the NF channel model is more sensitive to distance variations compared to the far-field model, this leads to pronounced discrepancies in the user channel characteristics in different regions. To effectively capture and utilize these diverse channel features, users are initially divided into distinct regions predicated on pivotal parameters, such as channel angle and distance. Correspondingly, a user region classifier based on convolutional neural networks is designed. Then, to fully harness the potential of deep residual networks (DRNs) in denoising, the aforementioned CE problem is reconceptualized as a denoising task, and a DRN-driven single region NF CE network, named SR-DRN-NFCE, is proposed. In addition, by integrating SR-DRN-NFCE networks corresponding to different regions and conducting joint training in a federated learning (FL) manner, a new network is obtained, named FL-DRN-NFCE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE network outperforms LS, MMSE, and no residual connections in terms of MSE, and the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE method has higher CE accuracy than the SR-DRN-NFCE method.</description>

      <title>Cooperative and Collaborative Multi-Task Semantic Communication for Distributed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a multi-task semantic communication (SemCom) system for distributed sources, extending the existing focus on collaborative single-task execution. We build on the cooperative multi-task processing introduced in [1], which divides the encoder into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs). While earlier studies in multi-task SemCom focused on full observation settings, our research explores a more realistic case where only distributed partial observations are available, such as in a production line monitored by multiple sensing nodes. To address this, we propose an SemCom system that supports multi-task processing through cooperation on the transmitter side via split structure and collaboration on the receiver side. We have used an information-theoretic perspective with variational approximations for our end-to-end data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative and collaborative multi-task (CCMT) SemCom system significantly improves task execution accuracy, particularly in complex datasets, if the noise introduced from the communication channel is not limiting the task performance too much. Our findings contribute to a more general SemCom framework capable of handling distributed sources and multiple tasks simultaneously, advancing the applicability of SemCom systems in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Support Vector Approach in Segmented Regression for Map-assisted Non-cooperative Source Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a non-cooperative source localization approach based on received signal strength (RSS) and 2D environment map, considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. Conventional localization methods, e.g., weighted centroid localization (WCL), may perform bad. This paper proposes a segmented regression approach using 2D maps to estimate source location and propagation environment jointly. By leveraging topological information from the 2D maps, a support vector-assisted algorithm is developed to solve the segmented regression problem, separate the LOS and NLOS measurements, and estimate the location of source. The proposed method demonstrates a good localization performance with an improvement of over 30% in localization rooted mean squared error (RMSE) compared to the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Line-of-Sight Propagation for Near-Field Beamfocusing in Cell-Free Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising approach for next-generation wireless networks, enabling scalable deployments of multiple small access points (APs) to enhance coverage and service for multiple user equipments (UEs). While most existing research focuses on low-frequency bands with Rayleigh fading models, emerging 5G trends are shifting toward higher frequencies, where geometric channel models and line-of-sight (LoS) propagation become more relevant. In this work, we explore how distributed massive MIMO in the LoS regime can achieve near-field-like conditions by forming artificially large arrays through coordinated AP deployments. We investigate centralized and decentralized CF architectures, leveraging structured channel estimation (SCE) techniques that exploit the line-of-sight properties of geometric channels. Our results demonstrate that dense distributed AP deployments significantly improve system performance w.r.t. the case of a co-located array, even in highly populated UE scenarios, while SCE approaches the performance of perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Fusing Global and Local: Transformer-CNN Synergy for Next-Gen Current Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model combining Transformer and CNN for predicting the current waveform in signal lines. Unlike traditional approaches such as current source models, driver linear representations, waveform functional fitting, or equivalent load capacitance methods, our model does not rely on fixed simplified models of standard-cell drivers or RC loads. Instead, it replaces the complex Newton iteration process used in traditional SPICE simulations, leveraging the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer framework to directly predict current responses without iterative solving steps. The hybrid architecture effectively integrates the global feature-capturing ability of Transformers with the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs, significantly improving the accuracy of current waveform predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional SPICE simulations, the proposed algorithm achieves an error of only 0.0098. These results highlight the algorithm's superior capabilities in predicting signal line current waveforms, timing analysis, and power evaluation, making it suitable for a wide range of technology nodes, from 40nm to 3nm.</description>

Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.</description>

      <title>UAV-Mounted IRS (UMI) in the Presence of Hovering Fluctuations: 3D Pattern Characterization and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to leverage the benefits of this technology for future communication networks, such as 6G. Key advantages include enhanced spectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible deployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI) technology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this challenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active elements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles, considering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The relationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking into account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form distribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear approximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit theorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance of UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should utilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As a result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS systems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in UAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the optimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid precoding is a key ingredient of cost-effective massive multiple-input multiple-output transceivers. However, setting jointly digital and analog precoders to optimally serve multiple users is a difficult optimization problem. Moreover, it relies heavily on precise knowledge of the channels, which is difficult to obtain, especially when considering realistic systems comprising hardware impairments. In this paper, a joint channel estimation and hybrid precoding method is proposed, which consists in an end-to-end architecture taking received pilots as inputs and outputting pre-coders. The resulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and interpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step is performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for imperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via unfolded projected gradient ascent. The great potential of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated on realistic synthetic channels.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Domain CFO Estimation Using Jutted Binary Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose jutted binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (J-BMOCZ) for non-coherent communication under a carrier frequency offset (CFO). By introducing asymmetry to the Huffman BMOCZ zero constellation, we exploit the identical aperiodic auto-correlation function of BMOCZ sequences to derive a Fourier-domain metric for CFO estimation. Unlike the existing methods for Huffman BMOCZ, which require a cyclically permutable code (CPC) for pilot-free CFO correction, J-BMOCZ enables the estimation of a CFO without the use of pilots or channel coding. Through numerical simulations in additive white Gaussian noise and fading channels, we show that the bit error rate (BER) loss of J-BMOCZ under a CFO is just 1 dB over Huffman BMOCZ without a CFO. Furthermore, the results show that coded J-BMOCZ achieves better BER performance than Huffman BMOCZ with a CPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we move towards 6G, the demand for high-precision, cost-effective positioning solutions becomes increasingly critical. Single-anchor positioning offers a promising alternative to traditional multi-anchor approaches, particularly in complex propagation environments where infrastructure costs and deployment constraints present significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of key algorithmic choices in the development of a single-anchor 5G uplink positioning testbed. Our developed testbed uses angle of arrival (AoA) estimation combined with range measurements from an ultra-wideband pair, to derive the position. The simulations conducted assess the impact of the selected algorithms on channel order and AoA estimation, while the influence of antenna calibration errors on AoA estimation is also examined. Finally, we compare simulations and results obtained from our developed platform.</description>

In particular, we aim at evaluation of two multi-target tracking scenarios based on the simulated class-B dataset and ADS-B class-A dataset provided by OpenSky Network. The scenarios are evaluated w.r.t. selection of a local state estimator using a range of the Stone Soup metrics. Source code with scenario definitions and Stone Soup set-up are provided along with the paper.</description>

      <title>Generalization analysis of an unfolding network for analysis-based Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05582</link>

Abstract: Unfolding networks have shown promising results in the Compressed Sensing (CS) field. Yet, the investigation of their generalization ability is still in its infancy. In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework complies with our theoretical findings and outperforms the baseline, consistently for all datasets.</description>

      <title>Building Resilience in Wireless Communication Systems With a Secret-Key Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resilience and power consumption are two important performance metrics for many modern communication systems, and it is therefore important to define, analyze, and optimize them. In this work, we consider a wireless communication system with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to and used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer resilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we propose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between resilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare constant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a reinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can be minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can be used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters for the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Just Project! Multi-Channel Despeckling, the Easy Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging. This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To obtain the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed DL CSI, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. Leveraging this, to mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) aided precoder optimization method. This method jointly updates the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.</description>
