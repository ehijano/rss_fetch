      <title>Queues with resetting: a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance modeling is a key issue in queuing theory and operation research. It is well-known that the length of a queue that awaits service or the time spent by a job in a queue depends not only on the service rate, but also crucially on the fluctuations in service time. The larger the fluctuations, the longer the delay becomes and hence, this is a major hindrance for the queue to operate efficiently. Various strategies have been adapted to prevent this drawback. In this perspective, we investigate the effects of one such novel strategy namely resetting or restart, an emerging concept in statistical physics and stochastic complex process, that was recently introduced to mitigate fluctuations-induced delays in queues. In particular, we show that a service resetting mechanism accompanied with an overhead time can remarkably shorten the average queue lengths and waiting times. We examine various resetting strategies and further shed light on the intricate role of the overhead times to the queuing performance. Our analysis opens up future avenues in operation research where resetting-based strategies can be universally promising.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Finite-Size Scaling above the Upper Critical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960's, four famous scaling relations were developed which relate the six standard critical exponents describing continuous phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit of statistical physics models. They are well understood at a fundamental level through the renormalization group. They have been verified in multitudes of theoretical, computational and experimental studies and are firmly established and profoundly important for our understanding of critical phenomena. One of the scaling relations, hyperscaling, fails above the upper critical dimension. There, critical phenomena are governed by Gaussian fixed points in the renormalization-group formalism. Dangerous irrelevant variables are required to deliver the mean-field and Landau values of the critical exponents, which are deemed valid by the Ginzburg criterion. Also above the upper critical dimension, the standard picture is that, unlike for low-dimensional systems, finite-size scaling is non-universal. Here we report on new developments which indicate that the current paradigm is flawed and incomplete. In particular, the introduction of a new exponent characterising the finite-size correlation length allows one to extend hyperscaling beyond the upper critical dimension. Moreover, finite-size scaling is shown to be universal provided the correct scaling window is chosen. These recent developments also lead to the introduction of a new scaling relation analogous to one introduced by Fisher 50 years ago.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic exponent koppa and the story of finite-size scaling above the upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling, hyperscaling and finite-size scaling were long considered problematic in theories of critical phenomena in high dimensions. The scaling relations themselves form a model-independent structure that any model-specific theory must adhere to, and they are accounted for by the simple principle of homogeneity. Finite-size scaling is similarly founded on the fundamental idea that only two length scales enter the game -- namely system length and correlation length. While all scaling relations are quite satisfactory for multitudes of physical systems in low dimensions, one fails in high dimensions...</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Preferential Attachment Networks A Dandelion Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new type of preferential attachment network, the growth of which is based on the eigenvalue centrality. In this network, the agents attach most probably to the nodes with larger eigenvalue centrality which represents that the agent has stronger connections. A new network is presented, namely a dandelion network, which shares some properties of star-like structure and also a hierarchical network. We show that this network, having hub-and-spoke topology is not generally scale free, and shows essential differences with respect to the Barab{\'a}si-Albert preferential attachment model. Most importantly, there is a super hub agent in the system (identified by a pronounced peak in the spectrum), and the other agents are classified in terms of the distance to this super-hub. We explore a plenty of statistical centralities like the nodes degree, the betweenness and the eigenvalue centrality, along with various measures of structure like the community and hierarchical structures, and the clustering coefficient. Global measures like the shortest path statistics and the self-similarity are also examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport theory describes the response of a macroscopic current to a thermodynamic force, thus producing entropy and apparently violating time-reversal symmetry. In this note I report a pedagogical derivation of the Green-Kubo formula for transport coefficients that highlights the intrinsically dynamical nature of this formula and showcases the relation between the apparent breach of time-reversal symmetry and the non-commutativity of the low-frequency / low-wavevector limits of the conserved-density susceptibilities, from which the formula can be established.</description>

      <title>Impact of chirality on active Brownian particle: Exact moments in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of chirality, accounting for translational diffusion, on active Brownian particles in two and three dimensions. Despite the inherent complexity in solving the Fokker-Planck equation, we demonstrate a Laplace transform method for precisely calculating the temporal evolution of various dynamic moments. Our analysis yields explicit expressions for multiple moments, such as the second and fourth moments of displacement, revealing the impact of persistence and chirality. These moments exhibit oscillatory behaviour, and excess kurtosis indicates deviations from the Gaussian distribution during intermediate time intervals.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic constraints on kinetic perturbations of homogeneous driven diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the static response to kinetic perturbations of nonequilibrium steady states that can be modeled as diffusions. We demonstrate that kinetic response is purely a nonequilibirum effect, measuring the degree to which the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem is violated out of equilibrium. For driven diffusions in a flat landscape, we further demonstrate that such response is constrained by the strength of the nonequilibrium driving via quantitative inequalities.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The established thermodynamic formalism of chaotic dynamics,valid at statistical equilibrium, is here generalized to systems out of equilibrium, that have yet to relax to a steady state. A relation between information, escape rate, and the phase-space average of an integrated observable (e.g. Lyapunov exponent, diffusion coefficient) is obtained for finite time. Most notably, the thermodynamic treatment may predict the finite-time distributions of any integrated observable from the leading and subleading eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius/Koopman transfer operator. Examples of that equivalence are shown, and the theory is tested numerically in three paradigms of chaos.</description>

      <title>Dispersionless Flat Mode and Vibrational Anomaly in Active Brownian Vibrators Induced by String-like Dynamical Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, active Brownian particles have emerged as a prominent model system for comprehending the behaviors of active matter, wherein particles demonstrate self-propelled motion by harnessing energy from the surrounding environment. A fundamental objective of studying active matter is to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying its collective behaviors. Drawing inspiration from advancements in molecular glasses, our study unveils a low-energy ``flat mode" within the transverse spectrum of active Brownian vibrators -- a nearly two-dimensional, bi-disperse granular assembly. We demonstrate that this collective excitation induces an anomalous excess in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) beyond the phononic Debye contribution. Additionally, we establish through empirical evidence that string-like dynamical defects, discerned via the spatial distribution of each particle's contribution to the reduced transverse VDOS, serve as the microscopic origin of the flat mode and its associated anomalies. These findings underscore the pivotal role of string-like dynamical defects in elucidating the vibrational and mechanical properties of active Brownian particles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the barometric equation and the extent of a planetary atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard barometric equation predicts the molecular concentration $n(z)=n_0\exp(-z/L)$ where $L=k_BT/mg$. Because the mean free path $l=1/n\sigma$ increases exponentially, we show that at high altitudes $z$, the equation is no longer within the domain of applicability of the standard kinetic theory $l\ll L$. Here, we predict the dependence $n(z)\propto z^{-2}$ for the case $l\gg L$ in uniform gravity. It corresponds to a non-stationary planetary atmosphere with hydrogen accretion. The predicted accretion is accompanied by a release of gravitational potential energy that leads to heating of the atmosphere. In that context, we suggest gravitational energy could be the elusive source that drives the formation of stellar coronas. Other consequences of accretion are: slowly decaying tails of planetary atmospheres, the existence of gas giants, and periodical hydrogen explosions of white dwarfs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a fluid-like to a solid-like response by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging fluid state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalise this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high compared to shear, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sharp asymptotics of the under-bagging (UB) method, which is a popular ensemble learning method for training classifiers from an imbalanced data, is derived and used to compare with several other standard methods for learning from imbalanced data, in the scenario where a linear classifier is trained from a binary mixture data. The methods compared include the under-sampling (US) method, which trains a model using a single realization of the subsampled dataset, and the simple weighting (SW) method, which trains a model with a weighted loss on the entire data. It is shown that the performance of UB is improved by increasing the size of the majority class, even if the class imbalance can be large, especially when the size of the minority class is small. This is in contrast to US, whose performance does not change as the size of the majority class increases, and SW, whose performance decreases as the imbalance increases. These results are different from the case of the naive bagging in training generalized linear models without considering the structure of class imbalance, indicating the intrinsic difference between the ensembling and the direct regularization on the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metapopulation models have been instrumental in demonstrating the ecological impact of landscape structure on the survival of a focal species in complex environments. However, extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions limiting their scope. Here, we develop a multilayer network model of competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how spatially structured environments impact species coexistence and ecosystem stability. We show that homogeneous environments always lead to monodominance unless all species' fitness parameters are in an exact trade-off. However, this precise fine-tuning does not guarantee coexistence in generic heterogeneous environments. By introducing general spatial disorder in the model, we solve it exactly in the mean-field limit, finding that stable coexistence becomes possible in the presence of strong disorder. Crucially, coexistence is supported by the spontaneous localization of species through the emergence of ecological niches. Our results remain qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where topological features can improve species coexistence. Finally, we employ our model to study how correlated disorder promotes spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and riverine landscapes. Our work provides a novel framework to understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In literature on stochastic thermodynamics it is stated that for a system connected to multiple thermal reservoirs, the transition rates between two energy levels equals the sum of transition rates corresponding to each thermal bath the system is connected to. We show that this assumption leads to an impossibility of the system attaining a steady state by considering a system connected to two thermal baths. As an alternative we suggest splitting up the system into subsystems with one subsystem connected to one thermal bath and another subsystem connected to a second bath, and the rest exchanging energy with these two. We show that the collective evolution of the system as a whole is non-Markovian.</description>

      <title>Mimicking quantum self-propulsion creates a generic route to quantum active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generic framework for describing quantum active matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that is of pure quantum origin. These quantum-active features are most clearly revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short time scales, that are intricately dependent on the geometry of the trapping potential.</description>

Abstract: The formation of topological defects after a symmetry-breaking phase transition is an overarching phenomenon that encodes rich information about the underlying dynamics. Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), which describes these nonequilibrium dynamics, predicts defect densities of these second-order phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations. It has been verified as a successful model in a wide variety of physical systems, finding applications from structure formation in the early universe to condensed matter systems. However, whether topologically-trivial Ising domains, one of the most common and fundamental types of domains in condensed matter systems, also obey the KZM has never been investigated in the laboratory. We examined two different kinds of three-dimensional (3D) structural Ising domains: clockwise (CW)/counter-clockwise (CCW) ferro-rotation domains in NiTiO3 and up/down polar domains in BiTeI. While the KZM slope of ferro-rotation domains in NiTiO3 agrees well with the prediction of the 3D Ising model, the KZM slope of polar domains in BiTeI surprisingly far exceeds the theoretical limit, setting an exotic example where possible weak long-range dipolar interactions play a critical role in steepening the KZM slope of non-topological quantities. Our results demonstrate the validity of KZM for Ising domains and reveal an enhancement of the power-law exponent and a possible reduction of the dynamic critical exponent z for transitions with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium protection and spatial localization of noise-induced fluctuations: quasi-one-dimensional driven lattice gas with partially penetrable obstacle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonequilibrium transition that leads to the formation of nonlinear steady-state structures due to the gas flow scattering on a partially penetrable obstacle. The resulting nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) corresponds to a two-domain gas structure attained at certain critical parameters. We use a simple mean-field model of the driven lattice gas with ring topology to demonstrate that this transition is accompanied by the emergence of local invariants related to a complex composed of the obstacle and its nearest gas surrounding, which we refer to as obstacle edges. These invariants are independent of the main system parameters and behave as local first integrals, at least qualitatively. As a result, the complex becomes insensitive to the noise of external driving field within the overcritical domain. The emerged invariants describe the conservation of the number of particles inside the obstacle and strong temporal synchronization or correlation of gas states at obstacle edges. Such synchronization guarantees the equality to zero of the total edge current at any time. The robustness against external drive fluctuations is shown to be accompanied by strong spatial localization of induced gas fluctuations near the domain wall separating the depleted and dense gas phases. Such a behavior can be associated with nonequilibrium protection effect and synchronization of edges. The transition rates between different NESSs are shown to be different. The relaxation rates from one NESS to another take complex and real values in the sub- and overcritical regimes, respectively. The mechanism of these transitions is governed by the generation of shock waves at the back side of the obstacle. In the subcritical regime, these solitary waves are generated sequentially many times, while only a single excitation is sufficient to rearrange the system state in the overcritical regime.</description>

Abstract: We present three different neural network algorithms to calculate thermodynamic properties as well as dynamic correlation functions at finite temperatures for quantum lattice models. The first method is based on purification, which allows for the exact calculation of the operator trace. The second one is based on a sampling of the trace using minimally entangled states, whereas the third one makes use of quantum typicality. In the latter case, we approximate a typical infinite-temperature state by wave functions which are given by a product of a projected pair and a neural network part and evolve this typical state in imaginary time.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Predictive Theories through Integrating Quantum, Statistical, Equilibrium, and Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04143v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's thermodynamics is largely based on the combined law for equilibrium systems and statistical mechanics derived by Gibbs in 1873 and 1901, respectively, while irreversible thermodynamics for nonequilibrium systems resides essentially on the Onsager Theorem as a separate branch of thermodynamics developed in 1930s. Between them, quantum mechanics was invented and was quantitatively solved in terms of density functional theory (DFT) in 1960s. These three scientific domains operate based on different principles and are very much separated from each other. In analogy to the parable of the blind men and the elephant articulated by Perdew, they individually represent different portions of a complex system and thus are incomplete by themselves alone, resulting in the lack of quantitative agreement between their predictions and experimental observations. Over the last two decades, the author's group has developed a multiscale entropy approach (recently termed as zentropy theory) that integrates DFT-based quantum mechanics and Gibbs statistical mechanics and is capable of accurately predicting entropy and free energy of complex systems. Furthermore, in combination with the combined law for nonequilibrium systems developed by Hillert, the author developed the theory of cross phenomena beyond the phenomenological Onsager Theorem. The zentropy theory and theory of cross phenomena jointly provide quantitative predictive theories for systems from electronic to any observable scales as reviewed in the present work.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy for a nonequilibrium dilute gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy of a dilute gas of N particles, N&gt;&gt;1, as it undergoes a free expansion doubling its volume. The microstate of the system, a point in the 4N dimensional phase space, changes in time via Hamiltonian dynamics. Its entropy, at any time $t$, is given by the logarithm of the phase space volume of all the microstates giving rise to its macrostate at time $t$. The macrostates that we consider are defined by coarse graining the one-particle phase space into cells $\Delta_\alpha$. The initial and final macrostates of the system are equilibrium states in volumes $V$ and $2V$, with the same energy $E$ and particle number $N$. Their entropy per particle is given, for sufficiently large systems, by the thermodynamic entropy as a function of the particle and energy density, whose leading term is independent of the size of the $\Delta_\alpha$. The intermediate (non-equilibrium) entropy does however depend on the size of the cells $\Delta_\alpha$. Its change with time is due to (i) dispersal in physical space from free motion and to (ii) the collisions between particles which change their velocities. The former depends strongly on the size of the velocity coarse graining $\Delta v$: it produces entropy at a rate proportional to $\Delta v$. This dependence is investigated numerically and analytically for a dilute two-dimensional gas of hard discs. It becomes significant when the mean free path between collisions is of the same order or larger than the length scale of the initial spatial inhomogeneity. In the opposite limit, the rate of entropy production is essentially independent of $\Delta v$ and is given by the Boltzmann equation for the limit $\Delta v\rightarrow 0$. We show that when both processes are active the time dependence of the entropy has a scaling form involving the ratio of the rates of its production by the two processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical results for the Rosenzweig Porter model for all symmetry classes of the Dyson threefold way. We analyzed the fluctuation properties in the eigenvalue spectra, and compared them with existing and new analytical results. Based on these results we propose characteristics of the spectral properties as measures to explore the transition from Poisson to Wigner Dyson WD statistics. Furthermore, we performed thorough studies of the properties of the eigenvectors in terms of the fractal dimensions, the Kullback Leibler KL divergences and the fidelity susceptibility. The ergodic and Anderson transitions take place at the same parameter values and a finite size scaling analysis of the KL divergences at the transitions yields the same critical exponents for all three WD classes, thus indicating superuniversality of these transitions.</description>

      <title>Plasma kinetics: Discrete Boltzmann modelling and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) for plasma kinetics is proposed. The constructing of DBM mainly considers two aspects. The first is to build a physical model with sufficient physical functions before simulation. The second is to present schemes for extracting more valuable information from massive data after simulation. For the first aspect, the model is equivalent to a magnetohydrodynamic model plus a coarse-grained model for the most relevant TNE behaviors including the entropy production rate. A number of typical benchmark problems including Orszag-Tang (OT) vortex problem are used to verify the physical functions of DBM. For the second aspect, the DBM use non-conserved kinetic moments of (f-feq) to describe non-equilibrium state and behaviours of complex system. The OT vortex problem and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are practical applications of the second aspect. For RMI with interface inverse and re-shock process, it is found that, in the case without magnetic field, the non-organized momentum flux shows the most pronounced effects near shock front, while the non-organized energy flux shows the most pronounced behaviors near perturbed interface. The influence of magnetic field on TNE effects shows stages: before the interface inverse, the TNE strength is enhanced by reducing the interface inverse speed; while after the interface inverse, the TNE strength is significantly reduced. Both the global average TNE strength and entropy production rate contributed by non-organized energy flux can be used as physical criteria to identify whether or not the magnetic field is sufficient to prevent the interface inverse.</description>

      <title>Embedding Quantum Many-Body Scars into Decoherence-Free Subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians, which could support coherent revival dynamics from special initial states when scars form an equally spaced tower in the energy spectrum. For open quantum systems, engineering many-body scarred dynamics by a controlled coupling to the environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a general framework to exactly embed quantum many-body scars into the decoherence-free subspaces of Lindblad master equations. The dissipative scarred dynamics manifest persistent periodic oscillations for generic initial states, and can be practically utilized to prepare scar states with potential quantum metrology applications.We construct the Liouvillian dissipators with the local projectors that annihilate the whole scar towers, and utilize the Hamiltonian part to rotate the undesired states out of the null space of dissipators. We demonstrate our protocol through several typical models hosting many-body scar towers, and propose an experimental scheme to observe the dissipative scarred dynamics based on digital quantum simulations and resetting ancilla qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inclusion process on the complete graph with vanishing diffusivity, which leads to condensation of particles in the thermodynamic limit. Describing particle configurations in terms of size-biased and appropriately scaled empirical measures of mass distribution, we establish convergence in law of the inclusion process to a measure-valued Markov process on the space of probability measures. In the case where the diffusivity vanishes like the inverse of the system size, the derived scaling limit is equivalent to the well known Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, offering an alternative viewpoint on these well-established dynamics. Moreover, our approach covers all scaling regimes of the system parameters and yields a natural extension of the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion to infinite mutation rate. We also discuss in detail connections to known results on related Fleming-Viot processes.</description>

      <title>Riemann zeros as quantized energies of scattering with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an integrable physical model of a single particle scattering with impurities spread on a circle. The $S$-matrices of the scattering with the impurities are such that the quantized energies of this system, coming from the Bethe Ansatz equations, correspond to the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the the Riemann $\zeta(s) $ function along the axis $\Re ( s )= \half$ of the complex $s$-plane. A simple and natural generalization of the original scattering problem leads instead to Bethe Ansatz equations whose solutions are the non-trivial zeros of the Dirichlet $L$-functions again along the axis $\Re (s) = \half$. The conjecture that all the non-trivial zeros of these functions are aligned along this axis of the complex $s$-plane is known as the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). In the language of the scattering problem analysed in this paper the validity of the GRH is equivalent to the completeness of the Bethe Ansatz equations. Moreover the idea that the validity of the GRH requires both the duality equation (i.e. the mapping $s \rightarrow 1 - s$) and the Euler product representation of the Dirichlet $L$-functions finds additional and novel support from the physical scattering model analysed in this paper. This is further illustrated by an explicit counterexample provided by the solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations which employ the Davenport-Heilbronn function $\CD (s) $, i.e. a function whose completion satisfies the duality equation $\chi(s) = \chi(1-s)$ but that does not have an Euler product representation. In this case, even though there are infinitely many solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations along the axis $\Re (s) = \half$, there are also infinitely many pairs of solutions away from this axis and symmetrically placed with respect to it.</description>

Abstract: We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be rewritten in terms of local one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider an active, stochastic microscopic model of particles suspended in a fluid and show that the coarse-grained description of this model renders odd viscoelasticity. The particles are odd dumbbells, each featuring a robotic device as the bead, which exhibits a particular torque response. We show that this model can be macroscopically treated as a viscoelastic fluid, analytically calculate the coefficients of the corresponding viscoelastic model, and corroborate the results using molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides a unified analytical framework for several experimental and numerical setups designed to elucidate odd effects in fluids.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lee-Yang and Fisher Zeros in the 2D Ising model through multipoint Pad\'e approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical calculation of the Lee-Yang and Fisher zeros of the 2D Ising model using multi-point Pad\'{e} approximants. We perform simulations for the 2D Ising model with ferromagnetic couplings both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field using a cluster spin-flip algorithm. We show that it is possible to extract genuine signature of Lee Yang and Fisher zeros of the theory through the poles of magnetization and specific heat, using multi-point Pad\'{e} method. We extract the poles of magnetization using Pad\'{e} approximants and compare their scaling with known results. We verify the circle theorem associated to the well known behaviour of Lee Yang zeros. We present our finite volume scaling analysis of the zeros done at $T=T_c$ for a few lattice sizes, extracting to a good precision the (combination of) critical exponents $\beta \delta$. The computation at the critical temperature is performed after the latter has been determined via the study of Fisher zeros, thus extracting both $\beta_c$ and the critical exponent $\nu$. Results already exist for extracting the critical exponents for the Ising model in 2 and 3 dimensions making use of Fisher and Lee Yang zeros. In this work, multi-point Pad\'{e} is shown to be competitive with this respect and thus a powerful tool to study phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cascades are self-reinforcing processes underlying the systemic risk of many complex systems. Understanding the universal aspects of these phenomena is of fundamental interest, yet typically bound to numerical observations in ad-hoc models and limited insights. Here, we develop a unifying approach and show that cascades induced by a long-range propagation of local perturbations are characterized by two universality classes determined by the parity invariance of the underlying process. We provide hyperscaling arguments predicting hybrid critical exponents given by a combination of both mean-field spinodal exponents and $d$-dimensional corrections and we show how global symmetries influence the geometry and lifetime of avalanches. Simulations encompassing classic and novel cascade models validate our predictions, revealing fundamental principles of cascade phenomena amenable to experimental validation.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and the related Steklov problem in spheroidal domains ranging from a needle to a disk. An explicit matrix representation of this operator for both interior and exterior problems is derived. We show how the anisotropy of spheroids affects the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator. As examples of physical applications, we discuss diffusion-controlled reactions on spheroidal partially reactive targets and the statistics of encounters between the diffusing particle and the spheroidal boundary.</description>
