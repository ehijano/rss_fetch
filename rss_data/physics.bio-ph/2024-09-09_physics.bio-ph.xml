      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <title>Adaptive cross-country optimisation strategies in thermal soaring birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal soaring enables birds to perform cost-efficient flights during foraging or migration trips. Yet, although all soaring birds exploit vertical winds effectively, this group contains species that vary strongly in their morphologies. Aerodynamic rules dictate the costs and benefits of flight, but, depending on their ecological needs, species may use different behavioural strategies. To quantify these morphology-related differences in behavioural cross-country strategies, we compiled and analysed a large dataset, which includes data from over a hundred individuals from 12 soaring species recorded with high frequency tracking devices. We quantified the performance during thermalling and gliding flights, and the overall cross-country behaviour that is the combination of both. Our results confirmed aerodynamic theory across the 12 species; species with higher wing loading typically flew faster, and consequently turned on a larger radius, than lighter ones. Furthermore, the combination of circling radius and minimum sink speed determines the maximum benefits soaring birds can obtain from thermals. Also, we observed a spectrum of strategies regarding the adaptivity to thermal strength and uncovered a universal rule for cross-country strategies for all analysed species. Finally, our newly described behavioural rules can provide inspirations for technical applications, like the development of autopilot systems for autonomous robotic gliders.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Flow Past a Wall-Mounted Dolphin Dorsal Fin at Low Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dolphin swimming has been a captivating area of study, yet the hydrodynamics of the dorsal fin remain underexplored. In this study, we present three-dimensional simulations of flow around a wall-mounted dolphin dorsal fin, derived from a real dolphin scan. The NEK5000 (spectral element method) is employed with a second-order hex20 mesh to ensure high accuracy and computational efficiency in the simulations. A total of 13 cases were simulated, covering angles of attack (AoA) ranging from $0^\circ$ to $60^\circ$ and Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re}$) between 691 and 2000. Our results show that both drag and lift increase significantly with the AoA. Almost no vortex is observed at $\text{AoA} = 0^\circ$, whereas complex vortex structures emerge for $\text{AoA} \geq 30^\circ$, including half-horseshoe, hairpin, arch, and wake vortices. This study offers insights that could inform the design of next-generation underwater robots, heat exchangers, and submarine sails.</description>

      <title>Emergence of robust memory manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to store continuous variables in the state of a biological system (e.g. a neural network) is critical for many behaviours. Most models for implementing such a memory manifold require hand-crafted symmetries in the interactions or precise fine-tuning of parameters. We present a general principle that we refer to as {\it frozen stabilisation} (FS), which allows a family of neural networks to self-organise to a critical state exhibiting multiple memory manifolds without parameter fine-tuning or symmetries. Memory manifolds arising from FS exhibit a wide range of emergent relaxational timescales and can be used as general purpose integrators for inputs aligned with the manifold. Moreover, FS allows robust memory manifolds in small networks, and this is relevant to debates of implementing continuous attractors with a small number of neurons in light of recent experimental discoveries.</description>
