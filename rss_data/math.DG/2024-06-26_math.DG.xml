      <title>Exploring Stochastic Mean Curvature Flow on Networks Using Ito Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic mean curvature flow (SMCF) on networks, a niche area within stochastic processes and geometric analysis. By applying Ito calculus, we analyze the evolution of network structures influenced by random perturbations. We derive a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the network edges and utilize numerical simulations to study the stability, long-term behavior, and pattern formation in these systems. Our results offer new insights into the dynamics of complex networks under stochastic influences and open pathways for future research in stochastic geometry.</description>

      <title>The graded group action framework for sub-riemannian orbit models in shape spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard orbit model on shape analysis, a group of diffeomorphism on the ambient space equipped with a right invariant sub-riemannian metric acts on a space of shapes and induces a sub-riemannian structure on various spaces. An important example is given by the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) theory that has been developed initially in the context of medical imaging and image registration. However, the standard theory does not cover many interesting settings emerging in applications. We provide here an extended setting, the graded group action (GGA) framework, specifying regularity conditions to get most of the well known results on the orbit model for general groups and shape spaces equipped with a smooth structure of Banach manifold with application to multi-scale shape spaces. A specific study of the Euler-Poincar{\'e} equations inside the GCA framework leads to a uniqueness result for the momentum map trajectory lifted from shape spaces with different complexities deciphering possible benefits of over-parametrization in shooting algorithms.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue inequalities and three-term asymptotic formulas of the heat traces for the Lam\'{e} operator and Stokes operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establish the most essential connections of the eigenvalue problems for the Laplace operator, Lam\'{e} operator, Stokes operator, buckling operator and clamped plate operator. We show that the $k$-th Stokes (respectively, Laplace) eigenvalue is the limit of the $k$-th Lam\'{e} eigenvalue for the Dirichlet or traction boundary condition as the Lam\'{e} coefficient $\lambda$ tends to $+\infty$ (respectively, to $-\mu$). Furthermore, we establish the eigenvalue inequalities and three-term asymptotic formulas of the heat traces for the Laplace operator, the Lam\'{e} operator, the Stokes operator and buckling operator with the Dirichlet and traction boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the sinh-Gordon equation on graphs. We introduce a uniform a priori estimate to define the topological degree for this equation with nonzero prescribed functions on finite, connected and symmetric graphs. Furthermore, we calculate this topological degree case by case and show several existence results. In particular, we prove that the classical sinh-Gordon equation with nonzero prescribed function is always solvable on such graphs.</description>

Abstract: Using a size condition of the sharp log Sobolev functional (log entropy) near infinity only, we prove a rigidity result for ancient Ricci flows without sign condition on the curvatures. The result is also related to the problem of identifying type II ancient Ricci flows and their backward limits.</description>

      <title>Conformal Killing tensors and their Killing scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of how to characterise when a rank-two conformal Killing tensor is the trace-free part of a Killing tensor for a metric in the conformal class. We call such a metric a Killing scale. Our approach is via differential prolongation using conformally invariant tractor calculus. First, we show that there is a useful partial prolongation of the conformal Killing equation to a simplified equation for sections of some tractor bundle. We then use this partial prolongation to provide such an invariant characterisation in terms of the scale tractor and this partial prolongation. This captures invariantly the relevant Bertrand--Darboux equation. We show that Einstein Killing scales have a special place in the theory. On conformally flat manifolds, we give the full prolongation of the conformally Killing equation to a conformally invariant connection on a tractor bundle. Using this, we provide a characterisation of (non-scalar flat) Einstein Killing scales by an algebraic equation for the scale tractors corresponding to such metrics. This also provides an algebraic description of the linear subspace of conformal Killing tensors that are compatible with a given Einstein Killing scale. For completeness and to introduce the main ideas, we also study analogous questions for conformal Killing vectors.</description>

      <title>The blow-down map in Lie algebroid cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the blow-down map in cohomology in the context of real projective blowups of Lie algebroids. Using the blow-down map in cohomology we compute the Lie algebroid cohomology of the blowup of transversals of arbitrary codimension, generalising the Mazzeo-Melrose theorem on b-cohomology. To prove the result we develop a Gysin sequence for Lie algebroids. As another example we use the developed tools to compute the Lie algebroid cohomology of the action Lie algebroid $\mathfrak{so}(3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^3$, a result known in Poisson geometry literature. Moreover, we use similar techniques to compute the de Rham cohomology of real projective blowups.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Computational Efficiency of Motor Imagery BCI Classification with Block-Toeplitz Augmented Covariance Matrices and Siegel Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalographic signals are represented as multidimensional datasets. We introduce an enhancement to the augmented covariance method (ACM), exploiting more thoroughly its mathematical properties, in order to improve motor imagery classification.Standard ACM emerges as a combination of phase space reconstruction of dynamical systems and of Riemannian geometry. Indeed, it is based on the construction of a Symmetric Positive Definite matrix to improve classification. But this matrix also has a Block-Toeplitz structure that was previously ignored. This work treats such matrices in the real manifold to which they belong: the set of Block-Toeplitz SPD matrices. After some manipulation, this set is can be seen as the product of an SPD manifold and a Siegel Disk Space.The proposed methodology was tested using the MOABB framework with a within-session evaluation procedure. It achieves a similar classification performance to ACM, which is typically better than -- or at worse comparable to -- state-of-the-art methods. But, it also improves consequently the computational efficiency over ACM, making it even more suitable for real time experiments.</description>

      <title>The Calder\'on problem on Riemannian surfaces and of minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove two results. The first shows that the Dirichlet-Neumann map of the operator $\Delta_g+q$ on a Riemannian surface can determine its topological, differential, and metric structure. Earlier work of this type assumes a priori that the surface is a planar domain [36] or that the geometry is a priori known [29]. We will then apply this result to study a geometric inverse problem for determining minimal surfaces embedded in $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In particular we will show that knowledge of the volumes of embedded minimal surfaces determine not only their topological and differential structure but also their Riemannian structure as an embedded hypersurface. Such geometric inverse problems are partially inspired by the physical models proposed by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  The crucial ingredient in removing the planar domain assumption is the determination of the boundary trace of holomorphic functions from knowledge of the Dirichlet-Neumann map of $\Delta_g +q$. This requires a new type of argument involving Carleman estimates and construction of CGO whose phase functions are not Morse as in the case of [29]. We anticipate that these techniques could be of use for studying other inverse problems in geometry and PDE.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of Symmetry Breaking and Vacuum Degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a general system of scalar fields and gauge fields manifesting vacuum degeneracy induces a principal groupoid bundle over spacetime and that the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism are encoded by the singular foliation canonically induced on the moduli space of scalar vacuum expectation values by the Lie groupoid structure. Recent mathematical results in the classification of singular foliations then provide a qualitative classification of the possible patterns of vacuum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of Random Homology Induced by Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior, in the long time limit, of the random homology associated to realizations of stochastic diffusion processes on a compact Riemannian manifold. In particular a rigidity result is established: if the rate is quadratic, then the manifold is a locally trivial fiber bundle over a flat torus, with fibers being minimal in a weighted sense (that is, regarding the manifold as a metric measured space, with the invariant probability being the weight measure). Surprisingly, this entails that at least for some classes of manifolds, the homology of non-reversible processes relaxes to equilibrium slower than its reversible counterpart (as opposed to the respective empirical measure, which relaxes faster).</description>

Abstract: The present paper introduces a new class of geometric measures, the k-th (p,q)-mixed curvature measures, and a natural correspondence-(p,q)-Christoffel-Minkowski problem is proposed. The (p,q)-Christoffel-Minkowski problem posed here can be regarded as a natural generalization of the L_p Christoffel-Minkowski problem and Lp dual Minkowski problem.
  We investigate and arrive at the existence of smooth solution to the (p,q)-Christoffel-Minkowski problem by a type of expanding curvature flow. Furthermore, the uniqueness result of solutions to the (p,q)-Christoffel-Minkowski problem shall be discussed.</description>

Abstract: This is the first paper in a series that studies smooth relative Lie algebra homologies and cohomologies based on the theory of formal manifolds and formal Lie groups. In this paper, we lay the foundations for this study by introducing the notion of formal manifolds in the context of differential geometry, inspired by the notion of formal schemes in algebraic geometry. We develop the basic theory for formal manifolds, and establish a fully faithful contravariant functor from the category of formal manifolds to the category of topological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. We also prove the existence of finite products in the category of formal manifolds by studying vector-valued formal functions.</description>

      <title>Singularities on maxfaces constructed by node-opening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The node-opening technique, originally designed for constructing minimal surfaces, is adapted to construct a rich variety of new maxfaces of high genus that are embedded outside a compact set and have arbitrarily many catenoid or planar ends, thus removing the scarcity of examples of maxfaces. The surfaces look like spacelike planes connected by small necks. Among the examples are maxfaces of the Costa--Hoffman--Meeks type. Although very fruitful, the main challenge of this paper is not the construction itself, but the analysis of the positions and natures of singularities on these maxfaces. More specifically, we conclude that the singular set form curves around the waists of the necks. In generic and some symmetric cases, all but finitely many singularities are cuspidal edges, and the non-cuspidal singularities are swallowtails evenly distributed along the singular curves.</description>

      <title>Epstein Surfaces, $W$-Volume, and the Osgood-Stowe Differential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Epstein introduced the theory of what are now called Epstein surfaces, which construct surfaces in $\mathbb{H}^3$ associated to a conformal metric on a domain in $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$. More recently, these surfaces have been used by Krasnov-Schlenker to define the W-volume and renormalized volume associated with a convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifold. In this paper we consider Epstein surfaces, W-volume and renormalized volume in two main parts. In the first, we develop an alternate construction of Epstein surfaces using the Osgood-Stowe differential, a generalization of the Schwarzian derivative. Krasnov-Schlenker showed that the metric and shape operator of a surface in hyperbolic space is naturally dual to a conformal metric and shape operator on a projective structure via the hyperbolic Gauss map. We show that this projective shape operator can be derived from the Osgood-Stowe differential. This approach allows us to give a comprehensive and self-contained development of Epstein surfaces, W-volume, and renormalized volume. In the second part, we use the theory developed in the first to prove a number of new results including a generalization of Epstein's univalence criterion, a variational formula for W-volume in terms of the Osgood-Stowe differential, and a use of W-volume to relate the length of the bending lamination of the convex core to the norm of the Schwarzian derivative of the associated univalent map on the conformal boundary.</description>

      <title>The Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle and the noncommutative integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [5], Connes and Chamseddine defined a Hochschild cocycle in the general framework of noncommutative geometry. They computed this Hochschild cocycle for the Dirac operator on 4-dimensioanl manifolds. We propose a way to study the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle from the viewpoint of the noncommutative integral on 6-dimensional manifolds in this paper. We compute several interesting noncommutative integral defined in [8] by the normal coodinated way on n-dimensional manifolds. As a corollary, the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle on 6-dimensional manifolds is obtained.</description>

      <title>The general Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorem for the J-twist DJ of the Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [21] and [22], we proved the Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorem for the J-twist DJ of the Dirac operator on 3-dimensional, 4-dimensional and 6-dimensional almost product Riemannian spin manifold with boundary.
  In this paper, we generalize our previous conclusions and establish the proof of the general Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorem for the J-twist DJ of the Dirac operator on even-dimensional almost product Riemannian spin manifold with boundary.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of k-positive surface group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{k-positive representations}, a large class of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$--Anosov surface group representations into PGL(E) that share many features with Hitchin representations, and we study their degenerations: unless they are Hitchin, they can be deformed to non-discrete representations, but any limit is at least (k-3)-positive and irreducible limits are (k-1)-positive. A major ingredient, of independent interest, is a general limit theorem for positively ratioed representations.</description>

      <title>Stability in the Banach isometric conjecture and nearly monochromatic Finsler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Banach isometric conjecture asserts that a normed space with all of its $k$-dimensional subspaces isometric, where $k\geq 2$, is Euclidean. The first case of $k=2$ is classical, established by Auerbach, Mazur and Ulam using an elegant topological argument. We refine their method to arrive at a stable version of their result: if all $2$-dimensional subspaces are almost isometric, then the space is almost Euclidean. Furthermore, we show that a $2$-dimensional surface, which is not a torus or a Klein bottle, equipped with a near-monochromatic Finsler metric, is approximately Riemannian. The stability is quantified explicitly using the Banach-Mazur distance.</description>
