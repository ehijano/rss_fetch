      <title>Calculating Gromov-Hausdorff distance by means of asymptotic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the concept of asymptotic dimension to calculating Gromov-Hausdorff distances between some unbounded metric spaces. For example, we show that the Gromov--Hausdorff between $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean metric and $\mathbb{Z}^2$ equals the Hausdorff distance between them: $d_{GH}(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{Z}^2) = d_H(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{Z}^2)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the c-affine surface area $\Omega^c$, recently introduced by Sch\"utt, Werner and Yalikun. We show that on the class of ball-bodies, $\Omega^c$ is maximized by a ball of radius $\frac{n}{n+1}$, and that a Santal\'o-type inequality holds: $\Omega^c(K) \Omega^c(K^c) \leq \Omega^c(\frac{1}{2} B_2^n)^2$.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Ratio of a Generalized Chaos Game in Regular Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of an optimal ratio for regular polytopes in $n$-dimensional space within the framework of the Generalized Chaos Game. The optimal ratio, $r_{\text{opt}}$, is defined as the value at which the self-similar regions of the resulting fractal touch but do not overlap. Using a series of Python simulations, we explore how the optimal ratio varies across different polytopes, from two-dimensional polygons to three-dimensional polyhedra and beyond. The results, visualized through plots generated for various polytopes and values of the scaling factor $r$, demonstrate that the optimal ratio is not universal but rather depends on each polytope's specific properties. A formula is then derived for determining the optimal ratio for any regular polytope in any dimension. The formula is then experimentally verified using multiple Python programs designed to search and find the optimal ratio iteratively.</description>

      <title>Numerical characterization of the hard Lefschetz classes of dimension two, II: supercritical collections of free divisor classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $(n-2)$ free divisor classes on a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$, the product of these free divisor classes induces a Lefschetz type operator acting on the N\'{e}ron-Severi space or the cohomology group of $(1,1)$ classes. We give a characterization of this kernel space, when the collection of these free divisor classes is supercritical. This resolves Shenfeld-van Handel's open problem in this setting. As consequences, we provide an algebro-geometric proof of the characterization of the extremals of the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for a supercritical collection of rational convex polytopes; we also give a characterization of the extremals of the Khovanskii-Teissier inequality given by the intersection numbers of two arbitrary free divisor classes.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Lipschitz-free spaces over countable complete discrete metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there are uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic Lipschitz-free spaces over countable, complete, discrete metric spaces. Also there is a countable, complete, discrete metric space whose free space does not embed into the free space of any uniformly discrete metric space. This enhanced diversity is a consequence of the fact that the dentability index $D$ presents a highly non-binary behavior when assigned to the free spaces of metric spaces outside of the oppressive confines of compact purely 1-unrectifiable spaces. Indeed, the cardinality of $\{D(\mathcal F(M)): M$ countable, complete, discrete$\}$ is uncountable while $\{D(\mathcal F(M)):M$ infinite, compact, purely 1-unrectifiable$\}=\{\omega,\omega^2\}$. Similar barrier is observed for uniformly discrete metric spaces as higher values of the dentability index are excluded for their free spaces: $\{D(\mathcal F(M)):M$ infinite, uniformly discrete$\}=\{\omega^2,\omega^3\}$.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex hypersurfaces in the half-space with capillary boundary II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to [16, Conjecture 1.5] on the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for quermassintegrals for convex capillary hypersurfaces in the Euclidean half-space. More generally, we establish a theory for capillary convex bodies in the half-space and prove a general Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for mixed volumes of capillary convex bodies. The conjecture [16, Conjecture 1.5] follows as its consequence.</description>

      <title>On Minkowski symmetrizations of $\alpha$-concave functions and related applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Minkowski symmetral of an $\alpha$-concave function is introduced, and some of its fundamental properties are derived. It is shown that for a given $\alpha$-concave function, there exists a sequence of Minkowski symmetrizations that hypo-converges to its ``hypo-symmetrization". As an application, it is shown that the hypo-symmetrization of a log-concave function $f$ is always harder to approximate than $f$ is by ``inner log-linearizations" with a fixed number of break points. This is a functional analogue of the classical geometric result which states that among all convex bodies of a given mean width, a Euclidean ball is hardest to approximate by inscribed polytopes with a fixed number of vertices. Finally, a general extremal property of the hypo-symmetrization is deduced, which includes a Urysohn-type inequality and the aforementioned approximation result as special cases.</description>

      <title>Large-scale behaviour of Sobolev functions in Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behaviour at infinity of $p$-Sobolev functions in the setting of Ahlfors $Q$-regular metric measure spaces supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality. By introducing the notions of sets which are $p$-thin at infinity, we show that functions in the homogeneous space $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ necessarily have limits at infinity outside of $p$-thin sets, when $1\le p&lt;Q&lt;+\infty$. When $p&gt;Q$, we show by example that uniqueness of limits at infinity may fail for functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$. While functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ may not have any reasonable limit at infinity when $p=Q$, we introduce the notion of a $Q$-thick set at infinity, and characterize the limits of functions in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ along infinite curves in terms of limits outside $Q$-thin sets and along $Q$-thick sets. By weakening the notion of a thick set, we show that a function in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ with a limit along such an almost thick set may fail to have a limit along any infinite curve. While homogeneous $p$-Sobolev functions may have infinite limits at infinity when $p\ge Q$, we provide bounds on how quickly such functions may grow: when $p=Q$, functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ have sub-logarithmic growth at infinity, whereas when $p&gt;Q$, such functions have growth at infinity controlled by $d(\cdot, O)^{1-Q/p}$, where $O$ is a fixed base point in $X$. For the inhomogeneous spaces $N^{1,p}(X)$, the phenomenon is different. We show that for $1\le p\le Q$, the limit of a function $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ is zero outside of a $p$-thin set, whereas $\lim_{x\to+\infty}u(x)=0$ for all $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ when $p&gt;Q$.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for Spaces of Curvature Bounded Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact subsets $X\subset\R^N$ that have the Alexandrov curvature bounded above ($\leq$ $\kappa$) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact for subspaces of curvature bounded above. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions as an alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. In particular, we leverage the concept of the {\em large scale distortion}, and show examples of Euclidean subspaces, for which the known parameters such as the reach, $\mu$--reach and weak features size vanish, whereas the large scale distortion is finite, making our reconstruction results applicable for such cases.</description>

      <title>On the stability of hyperbolicity under quantitative measure equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known result of Shalom says that lattices in SO$(n,1)$ are $\mathrm{L}^p$ measure equivalent for all $p&lt;n-1$. His proof actually yields the following stronger statement: the natural coupling resulting from a suitable choice of fundamental domains from a uniform lattice to a non-uniform one is $(\mathrm{L}^p,\mathrm{L}^{\infty})$. Moreover, it is easy to see that the coupling is cobounded: the fundamental domain of the uniform lattice is contained in a union of finitely many translates of the fundamental domain of the non-uniform one. The purpose of this note is to prove that this statement is sharp in the following sense: if a ME-coupling from a hyperbolic group to a non-hyperbolic group is cobounded and $(\mathrm{L}^p,\mathrm{L}^{\infty})$, then $p$ must be less than some $p_0$ only depending on the hyperbolic group.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K,N)$-spaces to $CAT(0)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Schoen-Uhlenbeck \cite{SU83} established boundary regularity for energy-minimizing maps between smooth manifolds with the Dirichlet boundary condition under the assumption that both the boundary and the data are of $C^{2,\alpha}$. A natural problem is to study the qualitative boundary behavior of harmonic maps with rough boundary and/or non-smooth boundary data.
  For the special case where $u$ is a harmonic function on a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$, this problem has been extensively studied (see, for instance, the monograph \cite{Kenig94}, the proceedings of ICM 2010 \cite{Tor10} and the recent work of Mourgoglou-Tolsa \cite{MT24}). The $W^{1,p}$-regularity ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) has been well-established when $\partial\Omega$ is Lipschitz (or even more general) and the boundary data belongs to $W^{1,p}(\partial\Omega)$. However, for the endpoint case where the boundary data is Lipschitz continous, as demonstrated by Hardy-Littlewood's classical examples \cite{HL32}, the gradient $|\nabla u|(x)$ may have logarithmic growth as $x$ approaches the boundary $\partial \Omega$ even if the boundary is smooth.
  In this paper, we first establish a version of the Gauss-Green formula for bounded domains in $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure space. We then apply it to obtain the optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure spaces into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces. Our result is new even for harmonic functions on Lipschitz domains of Euclidean spaces.</description>
