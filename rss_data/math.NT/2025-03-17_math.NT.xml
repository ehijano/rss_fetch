      <title>Equidistribution Conditions for Gaps of Geometric Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2008, Wang \&amp; Wang showed that the set of gaps of a numerical semigroup generated by two coprime positive integers $a$ and $b$ is equidistributed modulo 2 precisely when $a$ and $b$ are both odd. Shor generalized this in 2022, showing that the set of gaps of such a numerical semigroup is equidistributed modulo $m$ when $a$ and $b$ are coprime to $m$ and at least one of them is 1 modulo $m$. In this paper, we further generalize these results by considering numerical semigroups generalized by geometric sequences of the form $a^k, a^{k-1}b, \dots, b^k$, aiming to determine when the corresponding set of gaps is equidistributed modulo $m$. With elementary methods, we are able to obtain a result for $k=2$ and all $m$. We then work with cyclotomic rings, using results about multiplicative independence of cyclotomic units to obtain results for all $k$ and infinitely many $m$. Finally, we take an approach with cyclotomic units and Dirichlet L-functions to obtain results for all $k$ and all $m$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate some weighted integer partitions whose generating functions are double-series. We will establish closed formulas for these $q$-double series and deduce that their coefficients are non-negative. This leads to inequalities among integer partitions.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric inequalities for Fibonacci chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider m-bonacci chains, unidimensional quasicrystals obtained by general classes of Rauzy substitutions. Motivated by applications in spectrography and diffraction patterns of some quasicrystals, we pose the problem of establishing Ingham type trigonometric inequalities when the frequencies belong to $m$-bonacci chains. The result is achieved by characterizing the upper density of the $m$-bonacci chains. Tools from symbolic dynamics and combinatorics on words are used. Explicit gap conditions for the particular cases of Fibonacci chains and Tribonacci chains complete the paper.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again study a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n&gt;1$ and $d&gt;2$ an integer. As in \cite{BK1}, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and partly by a point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we show that for any given prime integer $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is a real algebraic number field of any degree $n\geq 2$ is $3$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by a $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then show unconditionally that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is any number field (not necessarily real) of degree $n\geq 2$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then apply statistical results from arithmetic statistics to then deduce here several counting and statistical results; and among them includes applying here a more recent number field-counting result of Oliver Lemke-Thorne to then bound above the number of number fields $K_{f}:= K[x]\slash (f(x))$ of degree $m:= np^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant; and also bound above the number of number fields $L_{g}:= K[x]\slash (g(x))$ of degree $r:= n(p-1)^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Forms, Exact Covering Systems, and Product Identities for Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the applications of integral quadratic forms and exact covering systems in product identities for Ramanujan's theta functions. Infinitely many identities can be obtained using this approach. As examples, we demonstrate the structures in a universal way for twenty-two of Ramanujan's forty identities for the Rogers-Ramanujan functions. Many identities that are analogues of the forty identities can be naturally explained from this perspective. Additionally, we discuss ternary quadratic forms and derive new identities involving the product of three or more theta functions. Finally, we unify some of the previous approaches and provide a summary at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Planar tropical caustics: trivalency and convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <title>On density of the zeros of Dedekind zeta-functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $\sigma$ with $0\leq \sigma\leq 1$ and any $T&gt;10$ sufficiently large, let $N_{\zeta}(\sigma,K,T)$ be the number of zeros $\rho=\beta+i\gamma$ of $\zeta_{K}(s)$ with $|\gamma|\leq T$ and $\beta\geq \sigma$ and the zero being counted according to multiplicity. For $k\geq3,$ we have \[ N_{\zeta}(\sigma,K,T)\ll T^{\frac{2k}{6\sigma-3}(1-\sigma)+\varepsilon}, \] where \[ \frac{2k+3}{2k+6}\leq \sigma&lt;1 \] and the implied constant may depend on the number field $K$ and $\varepsilon.$ This improves previous results for $k\geq3$ of certain range of $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>The Mahler measure of exact polynomials in three variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06563v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that under certain explicit conditions, the Mahler measure of a three-variable polynomial can be expressed in terms of elliptic curve $L$-values and Bloch-Wigner dilogarithmmic values, conditionally on Beilinson's conjecture. In some cases, these dilogarithmic values simplify to Dirichlet $L$-values. The proof involves a construction of an element in $K_4^{(3)}$ of a smooth projective curve over a number field. This generalizes a result of Lal\'in for the polynomial $z + (x+1)(y+1)$. We apply our method to several other Mahler measure identities conjectured by Boyd and Brunault.</description>

      <title>Weighted sieves with switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted sieves are used to detect numbers with at most $S$ prime factors with $S \in \mathbb{N}$ as small as possible. When one studies problems with two variables in somewhat symmetric roles (such as Chen primes, that is primes $p$ such that $p+2$ has at most two prime factors), one can utilize the switching principle. Here we discuss how different sieve weights work in such a situation, concentrating in particular on detecting a prime along with a product of at most three primes.
  As applications, we improve on the works of Yang and Harman concerning Diophantine approximation with a prime and an almost prime, and prove that, in general, one can find a pair $(p, P_3)$ when both the original and the switched problem have level of distribution at least $0.267$.</description>

      <title>Almost sure bounds for weighted sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that when $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, then $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{61/80+\epsilon}$ for almost all $f$. We also show that there exist arbitrarily large values of $x$ such that $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \gg (\log\log(x))^{-1/2}$. This is different to what is found in the Steinhaus case, this time with the size of the Rademacher Euler product making the multiplicative chaos contribution the dominant one. We also find a sharper upper bound when we restrict to integers with a prime factor greater than $\sqrt{x}$, proving that $\sum_{\substack{n \leqslant x \\ P(n) &gt; \sqrt{x}}}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{21/80+\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>A distribution related to Farey sequences -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This version corrects minor inaccuracies and missprints. One drawing is changed.
  We continue to study some arithmetical properties of Farey sequences by the method introduced by F.Boca, C.Cobeli and A.Zaharescu (2001). Let $\Phi_{Q}$ be the classical Farey sequence of order $Q$. Having the fixed integers $D\geqslant 2$ and $0\leqslant c\leqslant D-1$, we colour to the red the fractions in $\Phi_{Q}$ with denominators $\equiv c \; \pmod D$. Consider the gaps in $\Phi_{Q}$ with coloured endpoints, that do not contain the fractions $a/q$ with $q\equiv c\;\pmod D$ inside. The question is to find the limit proportions $\nu(r;D,c)$ (as $Q\to +\infty$) of such gaps with precisely $r$ fractions inside in the whole set of the gaps under considering ($r = 0,1,2,3,\ldots$). In fact, the expression for this proportion can be derived from the general result obtained by C.Cobeli, M.V\^{a}j\^{a}itu and A.Zaharescu (2014). However, such formula expresses $\nu(r;D,c)$ in the terms of areas of some polygons related to a special geometrical transform. In the present paper, we obtain explicit formulas for $\nu(r;D,c)$ for the cases $3$ and $c=1,2$. Thus this paper cover the case $D=3$.</description>

      <title>Hecke orbits on Shimura varieties of Hodge type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Hecke orbit conjecture of Chai--Oort for Shimura varieties of Hodge type at odd primes of good reduction. We use a novel result for the local monodromy groups of $F$-isocrystals "coming from geometry", which refines Crew's parabolicity conjecture. In the course of the proof, we also introduce a noncommutative generalisation of Serre--Tate coordinates for formal neighbourhoods of central leaves, built upon the previous work of Caraiani--Scholze and Kim. Using these coordinates, we reinterpret Chai--Oort's notion of strongly Tate-linear subspaces and we establish upper bounds for their monodromy groups. For this step, we employ the notion of Cartier--Witt stacks, as introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie. Another crucial ingredient in the proof is a rigidity result proved by Chai--Oort, which shows that the relevant subspaces are strongly Tate-linear. On the way, we generalise de Jong's full faithfulness theorem for $F$-isocrystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the $p$-adic representation theory of $p$-adic Lie groups on solid vector spaces over a complete non-archimedean extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. More precisely, we define and study categories of solid, solid locally analytic and solid smooth representations. We show that the category of solid locally analytic representations of a compact $p$-adic Lie group is equivalent to that of quasi-coherent modules over its algebra of locally analytic distributions, generalizing a classical result of Schneider and Teitelbaum. For arbitrary $G$, we prove an equivalence between solid locally analytic representations and quasi-coherent sheaves over certain locally analytic classifying stack over $G$. We also extend our previous cohomological comparison results from the case of a compact group defined over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ to the case of an arbitrary group, generalizing results of Lazard and Casselman-Wigner. Finally, we study an application to the locally analytic $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have investigated how various partition statistics distribute as the size of the partition grows. In this work, we look at a particular statistic arising from the recent rejuvenation of MacMahon's partition analysis. More specifically, we compute all the moments of the alternating sum statistic for partitions. We prove this results using the Circle Method. We also propose a general framework for studying further questions of this type that may avoid some of the complications that arise in traditional approaches to the distributions of partition statistics, and we comment on the utility, comparative ease and opportunities to generalize to very broad settings.</description>
