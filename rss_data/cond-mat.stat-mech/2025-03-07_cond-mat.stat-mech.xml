      <title>Understanding entropy production via a thermal zero-player game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves in sampling the given temperature is achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber as a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game's rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures are explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ noise in the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the $N$-spin critical Ising model on a square lattice using Glauber dynamics and consider the typical one-unit time equal to $N$ single-spin-flip attempts. The divergence of correlation time with the linear extent of the system results in critical slowing down, a challenge to equilibration because the spin configurations generated in such a way are temporally correlated. We examine temporal correlations in the number of accepted spin flips and show a signature of non-trivial long-time correlation of a logarithmically decaying form or the corresponding power spectral density follows canonical $1/f$ noise.</description>

      <title>Random search with stochastic resetting: when finding the target is not enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a random search process with stochastic resetting and a partially accessible target $\calU$. That is, when the searcher finds the target by attaching to its surface $\partial \calU$ it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. After a random waiting time, the searcher either gains access to the resources within or detaches and continues its search process. We also assume that the searcher requires an alternating sequence of periods of bulk diffusion interspersed with local surface interactions before being able to attach to the surface. The attachment, detachment and target entry events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. In applications to animal foraging, the resources could represent food or shelter while resetting corresponds to an animal returning to its home base. We begin by considering a Brownian particle on the half-line with a partially accessible target at the origin $x=0$. We calculate the non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in the case of reversible adsorption and obtain the corresponding first passage time (FPT) density for absorption when adsorption is only partially reversible. We then reformulate the stochastic process in terms of a pair of renewal equations that relate the probability density and FPT density for absorption in terms of the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations allow us to incorporate non-Markovian models of absorption and desorption. They also provide a useful decomposition of quantities such as the mean FPT (MFPT) in terms of the number of desorption events and the statistics of the waiting time density. Finally, we consider various extensions of the theory, including higher-dimensional search processes and an encounter-based model of absorption.</description>

      <title>Infinite-temperature thermostats by energy localization in a nonequilibrium setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some lattice models having two conservation laws may display an equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous (positive temperature - PT) to a condensed (negative temperature) phase, where a finite fraction of the energy is localized in a few sites. We study one such stochastic model in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where the ends of the lattice chain are attached to two PT baths. We show that localized peaks may spontaneously emerge, acting as infinite-temperature heat baths. The number $N_b$ of peaks is expected to grow in time $t$ as $N_b \sim \sqrt{\ln t}$, as a consequence of an effective freezing of the dynamics. Asymptotically, the chain spontaneously subdivides into three intervals: the two external ones lying inside the PT region; the middle one characterized by peaks superposed to a background lying along the infinite-temperature line. In the thermodynamic limit, the Onsager formalism allows determining the shape of the whole profile.</description>

      <title>Reversal of tracer advection and Hall drift in an interacting chiral fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral fluids are defined by broken mirror or time-reversal symmetry, giving rise to tensorial transport coefficients with antisymmetric components. A key example is the odd mobility tensor, which governs the response of a chiral tracer to an applied force and induces a characteristic transverse drift. While this response is well understood in the infinite dilution limit, the impact of interparticle interactions on the tracer dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here, we conduct an analytical and computational study of a chiral fluid with interparticle interactions and show that, under an external driving force, a chiral tracer can undergo a complete reversal of both its transverse Hall drift and its advection along the force. This reversal emerges from the interplay between odd mobility and interaction-mediated forces, resulting in a phenomenon reminiscent of absolute negative mobility.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the Brownian $q=2$ Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active matter, such as the Vicsek Model of flocking, particles possesses an internal degree of freedom, such as their director, which is subject to interaction with other particles, provided they are within a certain range. In an effort to understand better the interplay between spatial and internal degrees of freedom, we study numerically a variation of the $q=2$ Potts Model on and off the lattice, where particles are additionally subject to Brownian motion. The lack of a feedback of the internal degrees of freedom to the spatial degrees of freedom renders this model generically non-equilibrium. We confirm previous work that showed that the static exponents of the phase transition are unaffected by the diffusion. In contrast to previous work, we show that the formation of ordered clusters is not undermined by diffusion, but should rather be thought of as an effective form of interaction. We demonstrate how our numerical findings can be understood on the basis of the well-established Model A, B and C: Off lattice, the Brownian $q=2$ Potts Model is Model C. On the lattice, it is Model A with an additional (irrelevant, conserved) Model B noise.</description>

      <title>Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the integrability of quantum circuits constructed from two-qubit unitary gates $U$ that satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. A brickwork arrangement of $U$ typically corresponds to an integrable Trotterization of some Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we consider more general circuit geometries which include circuits without any nontrivial space periodicity. We show that any time-periodic quantum circuit in which $U$ is applied to each pair of neighbouring qubits exactly once per period remains integrable. We further generalize this framework to circuits with time-varying two-qubit gates. The spatial arrangement of gates in the integrable circuits considered herein can break the space-reflection symmetry even when $U$ itself is symmetric. By analyzing the dynamical spin susceptibility on ballistic hydrodynamic scale, we investigate how an asymmetric arrangement of gates affects the spin transport. While it induces nonzero higher odd moments in the dynamical spin susceptibility, the first moment, which corresponds to a drift in the spreading of correlations, remains zero. We explain this within a quasiparticle picture which suggests that a nonzero drift necessitates gates acting on distinct degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Restoring thermalization in long-range quantum magnets with staggered magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with strong long-range interactions are thought to resist thermalization because of their discrete energy spectra. We show that applying a staggered magnetic field to a strong long-range Heisenberg antiferromagnet restores thermalization for a large class of initial states by breaking permutational symmetry. Using self-consistent mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we reveal that the energy spectrum, while composed of discrete subspaces, collectively forms a dense spectrum. The equilibration time is independent of system size and depends only on the fluctuations in the initial state. For initial states at low to intermediate energies, the long-time average aligns with the microcanonical ensemble. However, for states in the middle of the spectrum the long-time average depends on the initial state due to quantum scar-like eigenstates localized at unstable points in classical phase space. Our results can be readily tested on a range of experimental platforms, including Rydberg atoms or optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.</description>

      <title>Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic approach to quantum cooling limit of continuous Gaussian feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.</description>

      <title>Jamming pair of general run-and-tumble particles: Exact results, symmetries and steady-state universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While run-and-tumble particles are a foundational model for self-propelled particles as bacteria or Janus particles, the analytical derivation of their steady state from the microscopic details is still an open problem. By directly modeling the system at the continuous-space and -time level thanks to piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), we derive the conservation conditions which sets the invariant distribution and, more importantly, explicitly construct the two universality classes for the steady state, the detailed-jamming and the global-jamming classes. They respectively identify with the preservation or not in a detailed manner of a symmetry at the level of the dynamical internal states between probability flows entering and exiting jamming configurations. We call such symmetry active global balance, as it is the true nonequilibrium counterpart of the equilibrium global balance. Thanks to a spectral analysis of the tumble kernel, we give explicit expressions for the invariant measure in the general case. We show that the non-equilibrium features exhibited by the steady state include positive mass for the jammed configurations and, for the global-jamming class, exponential decay and growth terms, potentially modulated by polynomial terms. Interestingly, we find that the invariant measure follows, away from jamming configurations, a catenary-like constraint, which results from the interplay between probability conservation and the dynamical skewness introduced by the jamming interactions, seen now as a boundary constraint. This work shows the powerful analytical approach PDMP provide for the study of the stationary behaviors of RTP systems and motivates their future applications to larger systems, with the goal to derive microscopic conditions for motility-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Exact finite-size corrections in the dimer model on a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact finite-size corrections to the free energy $F$ of the dimer model on lattice $\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{N}$ with cylindrical boundary conditions have been derived for three cases where the lattice is completely covered by dimers: $\mathcal{M} = 2M$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N$; $\mathcal{M} = 2M - 1$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N$; and $\mathcal{M} = 2M$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N - 1$. For these types of cylinders, ratios $r_p(\rho)$ of the $p$th coefficient of $F$ have been calculated for the infinitely long cylinder (${\mathcal M} \rightarrow \infty$) and infinitely long strip (${\mathcal N} \rightarrow \infty$) at varying aspect ratios. As in previous studies of the dimer model on the rectangular lattice with free boundary conditions and for the Ising model with Brascamp-Kunz boundary conditions, the limiting values $p \to \infty$ exhibit abrupt anomalous behaviour of ratios $r_p(\rho)$ at certain values of $\rho$. These critical values of $\rho$ and the limiting values of the finite-size expansion coefficient ratios vary between the different models.</description>

      <title>Why gauge invariance applies to statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recently identified gauge invariance of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 217101 (2024)]. The gauge transformation is a non-commutative shifting operation on phase space that keeps the differential phase space volume element and hence the Gibbs integration measure conserved. When thermally averaged any observable is an invariant, including thermodynamic and structural quantities. Shifting transformations are canonical in the sense of classical mechanics. They also form an infinite-dimensional group with generators of infinitesimal transformations that build a non-commutative Lie algebra. We lay out the connections with the underlying geometry of coordinate displacement and with Noether's theorem. Spatial localization of the shifting yields differential operators that satisfy commutator relationships, which we describe both in purely configurational and in full phase space setups. Standard operator calculus yields corresponding equilibrium hyperforce correlation sum rules for general observables and order parameters. Using Monte Carlos simulations we demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance for finite shifting. We argue in favour of using the gauge invariance as a statistical mechanical construction principle for obtaining exact results and for formulating smart sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Incompatible observables in classical physics: A closer look at measurement in Hamiltonian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory famously entails the existence of incompatible measurements; pairs of observables which cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary precision. Incompatibility is widely regarded to be a uniquely quantum phenomenon, linked to failure to commute of quantum operators. Even in the face of deep parallels between quantum commutators and classical Poisson brackets, no connection has been established between the Poisson algebra and any intrinsic limitations to classical measurement. Here I examine measurement in classical Hamiltonian physics as a process involving the joint evolution of an object-system and a finite-temperature measuring apparatus. Instead of the ideal measurement capable of extracting information without disturbing the system, I find a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance relation: Measuring an observable leaves all Poisson-commuting observables undisturbed but inevitably disturbs all non-Poisson-commuting observables. In this relation the role of h-bar is played by an apparatus-specific quantity, q-bar. While not a universal constant, q-bar takes a finite positive value for any apparatus that can be built. I show that a classical version of Ozawa's model of quantum measurement, originally proposed as a means to violate the Heisenberg relation, does not violate the classical relation. Hence, incompatibility may prove to be a feature not only of quantum, but of classical physics too. This approach points the way to studying the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics, which was until now assumed to be trivial. It now seems possible that it is non-trivial and bears a resemblance to the quantum formalism. These findings may be of interest to researchers working on foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly for psi-epistemic interpretations. And there may be applications in the fields of precision measurement, nanoengineering and molecular machines.</description>

      <title>Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and entanglement dynamics in Floquet Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement of entropy as quantitative measures of information propagation in disordered many-body systems exhibiting Floquet time-crystal (FTC) phases. We find that OTOC spreads in the FTC with different characteristic timescales due to the existence of a preferred ``quasi-protected'' direction - denoted as $\ell$-bit direction - along which the spins stabilize their period-doubling magnetization for exponentially long times. While orthogonal to this direction the OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic times), along the $\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex structure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen dynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a later logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full thermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront propagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain, scrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the spins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs, independent of their distance, merging into a single growth. Alongside, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth over all time, reflecting the slow dynamics up to a thermal volume-law saturation.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>
