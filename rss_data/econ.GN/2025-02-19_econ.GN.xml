      <title>Beyond surveys: A High-Precision Wealth Inequality Mapping of China's Rural Households Derived from Satellite and Street View Imageries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide coverage and high-precision rural household wealth data is an important support for the effective connection between the national macro rural revitalization policy and micro rural entities, which helps to achieve precise allocation of national resources. However, due to the large number and wide distribution of rural areas, wealth data is difficult to collect and scarce in quantity. Therefore, this article attempts to integrate "sky" remote sensing images with "ground" village street view imageries to construct a fine-grained "computable" technical route for rural household wealth. With the intelligent interpretation of rural houses as the core, the relevant wealth elements of image data were extracted and identified, and regressed with the household wealth indicators of the benchmark questionnaire to form a high-precision township scale wealth prediction model (r=0.85); Furthermore, a national and township scale map of rural household wealth in China was promoted and drawn. Based on this, this article finds that there is a "bimodal" pattern in the distribution of wealth among rural households in China, which is reflected in a polarization feature of "high in the south and low in the north, and high in the east and low in the west" in space. This technological route may provide alternative solutions with wider spatial coverage and higher accuracy for high-cost manual surveys, promote the identification of shortcomings in rural construction, and promote the precise implementation of rural policies.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Analysis of Hydrogen Production: Costs, Policies, and Scalability in the Transition to Net-Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of gray, blue, and green hydrogen production pathways, evaluating their cost structures, investment feasibility, infrastructure challenges, and policy-driven cost reductions. The findings confirm that gray hydrogen (1.50-2.50/kg) remains the most cost-effective today but is increasingly constrained by carbon pricing. Blue hydrogen (2.00-3.50/kg) offers a transitional pathway but depends on CCS costs, natural gas price volatility, and regulatory support. Green hydrogen (3.50-6.00/kg) is currently the most expensive but benefits from declining renewable electricity costs, electrolyzer efficiency improvements, and government incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides tax credits of up to 3.00/kg. The analysis shows that renewable electricity costs below 20-30/MWh are essential for green hydrogen to achieve cost parity with fossil-based hydrogen. The DOE's Hydrogen Shot Initiative aims to lower green hydrogen costs to 1.00/kg by 2031, emphasizing the need for CAPEX reductions, economies of scale, and improved electrolyzer efficiency. Infrastructure remains a critical challenge, with pipeline retrofitting reducing transport costs by 50-70%, though liquefied hydrogen and chemical carriers remain costly due to energy losses and reconversion expenses. Investment trends indicate a shift toward green hydrogen, with over 250 billion projected by 2035, surpassing blue hydrogen's expected 100 billion. Carbon pricing above $100/ton CO2 will likely make gray hydrogen uncompetitive by 2030, accelerating the shift to low-carbon hydrogen. Hydrogen's long-term viability depends on continued cost reductions, policy incentives, and infrastructure expansion, with green hydrogen positioned as a cornerstone of the net-zero energy transition by 2035.</description>

      <title>Could AI Leapfrog the Web? Evidence from Teachers in Sierra Leone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to digital information is a driver of economic development. But although 85% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is covered by mobile broadband signal, only 37% use the internet, and those who do seldom use the web. We investigate whether AI can bridge this gap by analyzing how 469 teachers use an AI chatbot in Sierra Leone. The chatbot, accessible via a common messaging app, is compared against traditional web search. Teachers use AI more frequently than web search for teaching assistance. Data cost is the most frequently cited reason for low internet usage across Africa. The average web search result consumes 3,107 times more data than an AI response, making AI 87% less expensive than web search. Additionally, only 2% of results for corresponding web searches contain content from Sierra Leone. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct than web search results. These findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can cost-effectively bridge information gaps in low-connectivity regions.</description>

      <title>The Early Days of the Ethereum Blob Fee Market and Lessons Learnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethereum has adopted a rollup-centric roadmap to scale by making rollups (layer 2 scaling solutions) the primary method for handling transactions. The first significant step towards this goal was EIP-4844, which introduced blob transactions that are designed to meet the data availability needs of layer 2 protocols. This work constitutes the first rigorous and comprehensive empirical analysis of transaction- and mempool-level data since the institution of blobs on Ethereum on March 13, 2024. We perform a longitudinal study of the early days of the blob fee market analyzing the landscape and the behaviors of its participants. We identify and measure the inefficiencies arising out of suboptimal block packing, showing that at times it has resulted in up to 70% relative fee loss. We hone in and give further insight into two (congested) peak demand periods for blobs. Finally, we document a market design issue relating to subset bidding due to the inflexibility of the transaction structure on packing data as blobs and suggest possible ways to fix it. The latter market structure issue also applies more generally for any discrete objects included within transactions.</description>

      <title>Media Slant is Contagious</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the diffusion of media slant. We document the influence of Fox News Channel (FNC) on the partisan slant of local newspapers in the U.S. over the years 1995-2008. We measure the political slant of local newspapers by scaling the news article texts to Republicans' and Democrats' speeches in Congress. Using channel positioning as an instrument for viewership, we find that higher FNC viewership causes local newspapers to adopt more right-wing slant. The effect emerges gradually, only several years after FNC's introduction, mirroring the channel's growing influence on voting behavior. A main driver of the shift in newspaper slant appears to be a change in local political preferences.</description>

      <title>Correlation between upstreamness and downstreamness in random global value chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with upstreamness and downstreamness of industries and countries. Upstreamness and downstreamness measure respectively the average distance of an industrial sector from final consumption and from primary inputs. Recently, Antr\`as and Chor reported a puzzling and counter-intuitive finding in data from the period 1995-2011, namely that (at country level) upstreamness appears to be positively correlated with downstreamness, with a correlation slope close to $+1$. We first analyze a simple model of random Input/Output tables, and we show that, under minimal and realistic structural assumptions, there is a natural positive correlation emerging between upstreamness and downstreamness of the same industrial sector/country, with correlation slope equal to $+1$. This effect is robust against changes in the randomness of the entries of the I/O table and different aggregation protocols. Secondly, we perform experiments by randomly reshuffling the entries of the empirical I/O table where these puzzling correlations are detected, in such a way that the global structural constraints are preserved. Again, we find that the upstreamness and downstreamness of the same industrial sector/country are positively correlated with slope close to $+1$. Our results strongly suggest that (i) extra care is needed when interpreting these measures as simple representations of each sector's positioning along the value chain, as the ``curse of the input-output identities'' and labor effects effectively force the value chain to acquire additional links from primary factors of production, and (ii) the empirically observed puzzling correlation may rather be a necessary consequence of the few structural constraints (positive entries, and sub-stochasticity) that Input/Output tables and their surrogates must meet.</description>
