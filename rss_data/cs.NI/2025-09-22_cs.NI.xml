      <title>WiFiSim: Simulating WiFi Probe Requests via AOSP Analysis and Device Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi probe request (PR) frames encode fine-grained device interactions and serve as a critical basis for mobility and crowd analytics. However, pervasive MAC address randomization and the scarcity of labeled datasets hinder progress in PR-based studies. We introduce WiFiSim, a simulation framework that reconstructs PR generation through Android Open Source Project (AOSP) protocol analysis and finite-state device behavior modeling. WiFiSim identifies the key determinants of PR structure and timing while capturing realistic user-driven state transitions. Experiments show that WiFiSim achieves less than 5% deviation from real measurements in both distributional and temporal dynamics, scales to large-scale dataset synthesis, and enables reliable evaluation of downstream applications. Source code and sample datasets are publicly released to foster reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Smart Interrupted Routing Based on Multi-head Attention Mask Mechanism-Driven MARL in Software-defined UASNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing-driven timely data collection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) is crucial for marine environmental monitoring, disaster warning and underwater resource exploration, etc. However, harsh underwater conditions, including high delays, limited bandwidth, and dynamic topologies - make efficient routing decisions challenging in UASNs. In this paper, we propose a smart interrupted routing scheme for UASNs to address dynamic underwater challenges. We first model underwater noise influences from real underwater routing features, e.g., turbulence and storms. We then propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Interrupted Software-defined UASNs Reinforcement Learning (ISURL) framework which ensures adaptive routing through dynamically failure handling (e.g., energy depletion of sensor nodes or link instability) and real-time interrupted recovery. Based on ISURL, we propose MA-MAPPO algorithm, integrating multi-head attention mask mechanism with MAPPO to filter out infeasible actions and streamline training. Furthermore, to support interrupted data routing in UASNs, we introduce MA-MAPPO_i, MA-MAPPO with interrupted policy, to enable smart interrupted routing decision in UASNs. The evaluations demonstrate that our proposed routing scheme achieves exact underwater data routing decision with faster convergence speed and lower routing delays than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A Robust Scheduling of Cyclic Traffic for Integrated Wired and Wireless Time-Sensitive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a toolbox of technologies that enable deterministic communication over Ethernet. A key area has been TSN's time-aware traffic shaping (TAS), which supports stringent end-to-end latency and reliability requirements. Configuration of TAS requires the computation of a network-wide traffic schedule, which is particularly challenging with integrated wireless networks (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi) due to the stochastic nature of wireless links. This paper introduces a novel method for configuring TAS, focusing on cyclic traffic patterns and jitter of wireless links. We formulate a linear program that computes a network-wide time-aware schedule, robust to wireless performance uncertainties. The given method enables robust scheduling of multiple TSN frames per transmission window using a tunable robustness parameter ({\Gamma}). To reduce computational complexity, we also propose a sequential batch-scheduling heuristic that runs in polynomial time. Our approach is evaluated by using different network topologies and wireless link characteristics, demonstrating that the heuristic can schedule 90% of 6500 requested TSN streams in a large topology.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning-Federated Learning Powered Intrusion Detection System for IoT/5G Advanced Edge Computing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential expansion of IoT and 5G-Advanced applications has enlarged the attack surface for DDoS, malware, and zero-day intrusions. We propose an intrusion detection system that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN), a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and an autoencoder (AE) bottleneck within a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework. The CNN-BiLSTM branch captures local and gated cross-feature interactions, while the AE emphasizes reconstruction-based anomaly sensitivity. Training occurs across edge devices without sharing raw data. On UNSW-NB15 (binary), the fused model attains AUC 99.59 percent and F1 97.36 percent; confusion-matrix analysis shows balanced error rates with high precision and recall. Average inference time is approximately 0.0476 ms per sample on our test hardware, which is well within the less than 10 ms URLLC budget, supporting edge deployment. We also discuss explainability, drift tolerance, and FL considerations for compliant, scalable 5G-Advanced IoT security.</description>

      <title>Flying Drones to Locate Cyber-Attackers in LoRaWAN Metropolitan Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, many critical services and industrial systems rely on wireless networks for interaction with the IoT, hence becoming vulnerable to a broad number of cyber-threats. While detecting this kind of attacks is not difficult with common cyber-security tools, and even trivial for jamming, finding their origin and identifying culprits is almost impossible today, yet indispensable to stop them, especially when attacks are generated with portable or self-made devices that continuously move around. To address this open challenge, the FOLLOWME project investigates the feasibility of using UAV to locate and even chase attackers during illicit usage of the radio spectrum. The main objective is to develop a cyber-physical security framework that integrates network telemetry with wireless localization. The former triggers alarms in case of anomalies or known attack patterns and provides a coarse-grained indication of the physical area (i.e., the position of affected access gateways), whereas the latter systematically scans such area to identify the exact location of the attacker. The project will specifically address long-range metropolitan area networks and focus on the LoRaWAN protocol, which is the typical scenario for Smart City services.</description>

      <title>ConCap: Practical Network Traffic Generation for Flow-based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been studied in research for almost four decades. Yet, despite thousands of papers claiming scientific advances, a non-negligible number of recent works suggest that the findings of prior literature may be questionable. At the root of such a disagreement is the well-known challenge of obtaining data representative of a real-world network-and, hence, usable for security assessments. We tackle such a challenge in this paper. We propose ConCap, a practical tool meant to facilitate experimental research on NIDS. Through ConCap, a researcher can set up an isolated and lightweight network environment and configure it to produce network-related data, such as packets or NetFlows, that are automatically labeled, hence ready for fine-grained experiments. ConCap is rooted on open-source software and is designed to foster experimental reproducibility across the scientific community by sharing just one configuration file. Through comprehensive experiments on 10 different network activities, further expanded via in-depth analyses of 21 variants of two specific activities and of 100 repetitions of four other ones, we empirically verify that ConCap produces network data resembling that of a real-world network. We also carry out experiments on well-known benchmark datasets as well as on a real "smart-home" network, showing that, from a cyber-detection viewpoint, ConCap's automatically-labeled NetFlows are functionally equivalent to those collected in other environments. Finally, we show that ConCap enables to safely reproduce sophisticated attack chains (e.g., to test/enhance existing NIDS). Altogether, ConCap is a solution to the "data problem" that is plaguing NIDS research.</description>

      <title>ForestColl: Throughput-Optimal Collective Communications on Heterogeneous Network Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As modern DNN models grow ever larger, collective communications between the accelerators (allreduce, etc.) emerge as a significant performance bottleneck. Designing efficient communication schedules is challenging, given today's heterogeneous and diverse network fabrics. We present ForestColl, a tool that generates throughput-optimal schedules for any network topology. ForestColl constructs broadcast/aggregation spanning trees as the communication schedule, achieving theoretical optimality. Its schedule generation runs in polynomial time and is highly scalable. ForestColl supports any network fabric, including both switching fabrics and direct accelerator connections. We evaluated ForestColl on AMD MI250 and NVIDIA DGX A100 &amp; H100 clusters. ForestColl showed significant improvements over the vendors' own optimized communication libraries across various settings and in LLM training. ForestColl also outperformed other state-of-the-art schedule generation techniques with both more efficient generated schedules and substantially faster generation speed.</description>

      <title>FENIX: Enabling In-Network DNN Inference with FPGA-Enhanced Programmable Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in network data planes for advanced traffic analysis. However, existing solutions (such as FlowLens, N3IC, and BoS) still struggle to simultaneously achieve low latency, high throughput, and high accuracy. To address these challenges, we present FENIX, a hybrid in-network ML system that performs feature extraction on programmable switch ASICs and deep neural network inference on FPGAs. FENIX introduces a Data Engine that leverages a probabilistic token bucket algorithm to control the sending rate of feature streams, effectively addressing the throughput gap between programmable switch ASICs and FPGAs. In addition, FENIX designs a Model Engine to enable high-accuracy deep neural network inference in the network, overcoming the difficulty of deploying complex models on resource-constrained switch chips. We implement FENIX on a programmable switch platform that integrates a Tofino ASIC and a ZU19EG FPGA directly and evaluate it on real-world network traffic datasets. Our results show that FENIX achieves microsecond-level inference latency and multi-terabit throughput with low hardware overhead, and delivers over 95\% accuracy on mainstream network traffic classification tasks, outperforming SOTA.</description>

      <title>1Q: First-Generation Wireless Systems Integrating Classical and Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We sketch out the concept of 1Q, the first wireless generation of integrated classical and quantum communication. The 1Q framework features quantum base stations (QBSs) that support entanglement distribution via free-space optical links alongside traditional radio communications. Key new components include quantum cells, quantum user equipment (QUEs), and hybrid resource allocation spanning classical time-frequency and quantum entanglement domains. Several application scenarios are discussed and illustrated through system design requirements for quantum key distribution, blind quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. A range of unique quantum constraints are identified, including decoherence timing, fidelity requirements, and the interplay between quantum and classical error probabilities. Protocol adaptations extend cellular connection management to incorporate entanglement generation, distribution, and handover procedures, expanding the Quantum Internet to the cellular wireless.</description>
