      <title>Measurement of gravitational acceleration in a single laser operated atomic fountain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements on Earth's gravitational acceleration (g) using an in-house developed cold atom gravimeter (CAG) in an atomic fountain geometry. In the setup, the laser cooled $^{87}Rb$ atoms are launched vertically up in the fountain geometry and Doppler sensitive two-photon Raman pulse atom interferometry is applied to detect the gravitational acceleration experienced by the atoms. Using our gravimeter setup, we have measured the local value of 'g' in our laboratory with sensitivity of 621 $\mu$Gal for integration time of 1350 s.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional cascaded superfluorescent lasing in air enabled by resonant third harmonic photon exchange from nitrogen to argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity-free lasing in atmospheric air has stimulated intense research towards fundamental understanding of underlying physical mechanisms. In this Letter, we identify a new mechanism -- third harmonic photon mediated resonant energy transfer pathway leading to population inversion in argon via initial three-photon excitation of nitrogen molecules irradiated by intense 261 nm pulses -- that enables bidirectional two-color cascaded lasing in atmospheric air. By making pump-probe measurements, we conclusively show that such cascaded lasing results from superfluorescence (SF) rather than amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Such cascaded lasing with the capability of producing bidirectional multicolor coherent pulses opens additional possibilities for remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Transition of dimuonium through foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a study of the passage of dimuonium through the foil of ordinary matter. First, we provide an overview of how dimuonium is planned to be produced for such a type of experiment and how it is expected to interact with the ordinary atoms -- predominantly electromagnetically via the screened coulomb potential of the atomic nuclei. Then, we describe the transport equations that represent the evolution of dimuonium states during the passage and their solution methods. Finally, for three different foils (Beryllium, Aluminium and Lead), we present the results of this study. To estimate impact of uncertainties in the potential of a target atom, we study 15 different approximations of the atomic potential and show that the corresponding atomic-potential-model-dependent error in the yields of the low lying states of dimuonium is quite small within the framework of the applied Born approximation. The convergence of the results after truncation of the infinite system of transport equations to the finite number of quantum states of dimuonium is also studied, and good convergence for the yields of low-lying states is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler laser cooling and magnetic trapping of natural-abundance fermionic potassium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on reaching sub-Doppler temperatures of $^{40}$K in a single-chamber setup using a dispenser-based potassium source with natural (0.012$\%$ of $^{40}$K) isotopic composition. With gray molasses cooling on the $D_1$-line following a standard $D_2$-line magneto-optical trap, we obtain $3\times10^5$ atoms at $\sim$10~\textmu K. We reach densities high enough to measure the temperature via absorption imaging using the time-of-flight method. Directly after sub-Doppler cooling we pump atoms into the $F=7/2$ hyperfine ground state and transfer a mixture of $m_F=-3/2,-5/2$ and $-7/2$ Zeeman states into the magnetic trap. We trap $5\times10^4$ atoms with a lifetime of 0.6~s when the dispensers are heated up to maximize the atom number at a cost of deteriorated background gas pressure. When the dispensers have been off for a day and the magneto-optical trap loading rate has been increased by light induced atomic desorption we can magnetically trap $\sim$$10^3$ atoms with a lifetime of 2.8~s. The background pressure-limited lifetime of 0.6~s is a reasonable starting point for proof-of-principle experiments with atoms and/or molecules in optical tweezers as well as for sympathetic cooling with another species if transport to a secondary chamber is implemented.
  Our results show that unenriched potassium can be used to optimize experimental setups containing $^{40}$K in the initial stages of their construction, which can effectively extend the lifetime of enriched sources needed for proper experiments. Moreover, demonstration of sub-Doppler cooling and magnetic trapping of a relatively small number of potassium atoms might influence experiments with laser cooled radioactive isotopes of potassium.</description>
