      <title>Asymptotic behavior of Moncrief Lines in constant curvature space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of Moncrief lines on $2+1$ maximal globally hyperbolic spatially compact space-time $M$ of non-negative constant curvature. We show that when the unique geodesic lamination associated with $M$ is either maximal uniquely ergodic or simplicial, the Moncrief line converges, as time goes to zero, to a unique point in the Thurston boundary of the Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Obstructing two-torsion in the rational knot concordance group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there are many 2-torsion elements in the classical knot concordance group. On the other hand, it is not known if there is any torsion element in the rational knot concordance group $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{Q}$. Cha defined the algebraic rational concordance group $\mathcal{AC}_\mathbb{Q}$, an analogue of the classical algebraic concordance group, and showed that $\mathcal{AC}_\mathbb{Q}\cong\mathbb{Z}^\infty\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2^\infty\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4^\infty$. The knots that represent 2-torsions in $\mathcal{AC}_\mathbb{Q}$ potentially have order $2$ in $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{Q}$. In this paper, we provide an obstruction for knots of order $2$ in $\mathcal{AC}_\mathbb{Q}$ from being of finite order in $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{Q}$. Moreover, we give a family consisting of such knots that generates an infinite rank subgroup of $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{Q}$. We also note that Cha proved that in higher dimensions, the algebraic rational concordance order is the same as the rational knot concordance order. Our obstruction is based on the localized von Neumann $\rho$-invariant.</description>

      <title>Moduli Spaces of Lagrangian Surfaces in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ obtained from Triple Grid Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Links in $S^3$ as well as Legendrian links in the standard tight contact structure on $S^3$ can be encoded by grid diagrams. These consist of a collection of points on a toroidal grid, connected by vertical and horizontal edges. Blackwell, Gay and second author studied triple grid diagrams, a generalization where the points are connected by vertical, horizontal and diagonal edges. In certain cases, these determine Lagrangian surfaces in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. However, it was difficult to construct explicit examples of triple grid diagrams, either by an approximation method or combinatorial search. We give an elegant geometric construction that produces the moduli space of all triple grid diagrams. By conditioning on the abstract graph underlying the triple grid diagram, as opposed to the grid size, the problem reduces to linear algebra and can be solved quickly in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Reflection Positivity and Chern-Simons Functional Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a mathematical version of the formal Chern-Simons functional integral of Witten for manifolds equipped with a reflection may be constructed in terms of a reflection positive functional, associated to the quadratic term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian, on an algebra of functions on a Banach space ${\bf A}$ of connections on the underlying 3-manifold. This construction yields a Hilbert space associated to a surface preserved by the reflection. A version of the cubic Bosonic interaction term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian gives a self-adjoint operator on this Hilbert space, and by exponentiation, a unitary one parameter subgroup of operators. The vacuum expectation value of this one parameter subgroup is combined with an additional term associated to the ghost fields and their interaction, and an appropriate weak limit gives a partition function for the quantum field theory. This construction is nonperturbative. The theory is finite and does not require renormalization, as may be expected from perturbation theory. It is natural to ask whether the resulting partition function is related to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, or whether a more elaborate construction may be needed.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces with low genus in lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian $\mathbb{RP}^3$ with a bumpy metric or a metric of positive Ricci curvature, we show that there either exist four distinct minimal real projective planes, or exist one minimal real projective plane together with two distinct minimal $2$-spheres. Our proof is based on a variant multiplicity one theorem for the Simon-Smith min-max theory under certain equivariant settings. In particular, we show under the positive Ricci assumption that $\mathbb{RP}^3$ contains at least four distinct minimal real projective planes and four distinct minimal tori. Additionally, the number of minimal tori can be improved to five for a generic positive Ricci metric on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ by the degree method. Moreover, using the same strategy, we show that in the lens space $L(4m,2m\pm 1)$, $m\geq 1$, with a bumpy metric or a metric of positive Ricci curvature, there either exist $N(m)$ numbers of distinct minimal Klein bottles, or exist one minimal Klein bottle and three distinct minimal $2$-spheres, where $N(1)=4$, $N(m)=2$ for $m\geq 2$, and the first case happens under the positive Ricci assumption.</description>

      <title>Unstable cohomology of $\mathsf{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ and the odd commutative graph complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a closed differential form on the symmetric space of positive definite matrices, which is defined using the Pfaffian and is $\mathsf{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ invariant up to a sign. It gives rise to an infinite family of unstable classes in the compactly-supported cohomology of the locally symmetric space for $\mathsf{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ with coefficients in the orientation bundle. Furthermore, by applying the Pfaffian forms to the dual Laplacian of graphs, and integrating them over the space of edge lengths, we construct an infinite family of cocycles for the odd commutative graph complex. By explicit computation, we show that the first such cocycle gives a non-trivial class in $H^{-6}(\mathsf{GC}_3)$.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras for 3-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct the cohomological Hall algebras for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a strong orientation data. This can be regarded as a mathematical definition of the algebra of BPS states, whose existence was first mathematically conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma,\mathbb{M},\mathbb{P})$ be a surface with marked points $\mathbb{M}\subseteq \partial\Sigma\neq\varnothing$ and punctures $\mathbb{P}\subseteq\Sigma\setminus\partial\Sigma$. In this paper we show that for every curve $\gamma$ on $\Sigma\setminus\mathbb{P}$, the curve obtained by resolving the kinks of $\gamma$ in any order is uniquely determined, up to homotopy in $\Sigma\setminus\mathbb{P}$, by the $2$-orbifold homotopy class of $\gamma$, in which the punctures are interpreted to be orbifold points of order $2$. Our proof resorts to an application of the Diamond Lemma.</description>

      <title>Degenerations Of Skein Algebras And Quantum Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a joint generalization, called LRY skein algebras, of Kauffman bracket skein algebras (of surfaces) that encompasses both Roger-Yang skein algebras and stated skein algebras. We will show that, over an arbitrary ground ring which is a commutative domain, the LRY skein algebras are domains and have degenerations (by filtrations) equal to monomial subalgebras of quantum tori. For surfaces without interior punctures, this integrality generalizes a result of Moon and Wong to the most general ground ring. We also calculate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of LRY algebras and show they are Noetherian if the ground ring is. Moreover they are orderly finitely generated. To study the LRY algebras and prove the above-mentioned results, we construct quantum traces, both the so-called X-version for all surfaces and also an A-version for a smaller class of surfaces. We also introduce a modified version of Dehn-Thurston coordinates for curves which are more suitable for the study of skein algebras as they pick up the highest degree terms of products in certain natural filtrations.</description>

      <title>On the codimension-two cohomology of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Borel-Serre proved that $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is a virtual duality group of dimension $n \choose 2$ and the Steinberg module $\mathrm{St}_n(\mathbb{Q})$ is its dualizing module. This module is the top-dimensional homology group of the Tits building associated to $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Q})$. We determine the "relations among the relations" of this Steinberg module. That is, we construct an explicit partial resolution of length two of the $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$-module $\mathrm{St}_n(\mathbb{Q})$. We use this partial resolution to show the codimension-2 rational cohomology group $H^{{n \choose 2} -2}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z});\mathbb{Q})$ of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ vanishes for $n \geq 3$. This resolves a case of a conjecture of Church-Farb-Putman. We also produce lower bounds for the codimension-1 cohomology of certain congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>A New Construction of the Vietoris-Rips Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, inductive construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex, in which we take advantage of a small amount of unexploited combinatorial structure in the $k$-skeleton of the complex in order to avoid unnecessary comparisons when identifying its $(k+1)$-simplices. In doing so, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of comparisons required to construct the Vietoris-Rips compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, which is seen here by examining the computational complexity of the critical step in the algorithms. In experiments comparing a C/C++ implementation of our algorithm to the GUDHI v3.9.0 software package, this results in an observed $5$-$10$-fold improvement in speed of on sufficiently sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with the best advantages as the graphs become sparser, as well as for higher dimensional Vietoris-Rips complexes. We further clarify that the algorithm described in Boissonnat and Maria (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33090-2_63) for the construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex is exactly the Incremental Algorithm from Zomorodian (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2010.03.007), albeit with the additional requirement that the result be stored in a tree structure, and we explain how these techniques are different from the algorithm presented here.</description>
