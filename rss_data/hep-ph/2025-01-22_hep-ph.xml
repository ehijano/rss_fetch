      <title>Excited s-wave $1^{--}$ vector mesons, their leptonic decays and (in-)complete absence of abnormal states as seen from the constituent quark BSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a lattice inspired interaction between quark and antiquark, we obtain hierarchy of Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) solutions for vector quarkonia excited states in the constituent quark mass approximation. As a toy model, we apply the similar to calculate ground and excited states of $\phi$ and $\omega/\rho$ meson. Performing detailed numerical search, our study provides the evidence that the quark propagator with single valued constant mass does not provide known meson spectra without the presence of abnormal (unphysical) solutions simultaneously. We classify normal and abnormal solutions and discuss necessary changes in calculation scheme preventing the spectrum from inconsistent solutions. While all experimentaly narrow vector mesons are identified with a normal state of the BSE, the intriguing appearance of mutualy canceled normal-abnormal states is reported. They appearance discriminate between heavy and the light mesons. In both cases they seems to be remainder of inconsitent use of the hmogeneous BSE for the description of broad resonances.</description>

      <title>(H)ALPing the 511 keV line: A thermal DM interpretation of the 511 keV emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework where MeV-scale Dirac Dark Matter annihilates into axion-like particles, providing a natural explanation for the 511 keV gamma-ray line observed in the Galactic Center. The relic abundance is determined by p-wave annihilation into two axion-like particles, while s-wave annihilation into three axion-like particles, decaying into $e^+ e^-$ pairs, accounts for the line intensity. Remarkably, this model, assuming a standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, reproduces the observed emission morphology, satisfies in-flight annihilation and cosmological bounds, and achieves the correct relic density, offering a compelling resolution to this longstanding anomaly.</description>

      <title>The role of the chiral anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering III: Wess-Zumino-Witten contributions and chiral Ward identities for finite quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10519v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inferring Nucleon's Gravitation Form Factors via Near-threshold $J/\psi$ Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of recent near-threshold $J/\psi$ production measurements by the $J/\psi$ 007 experiment and GlueX collaboration on the extraction of proton's gravitational form factors. We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next-to-leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative $C_q(t)$ and $C_g(t)$ are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Resummation of threshold double logarithms in inclusive production of heavy quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resum threshold double logarithms in inclusive production of heavy quarkonium that arise from singularities near the boundary of phase space. This resolves the catastrophic failure in the conventional approach based on fixed-order perturbation theory calculations in nonrelativistic QCD, where quarkonium cross sections at large transverse momentum can turn negative. We identify the root cause of this negative cross section problem as the appearance of threshold logarithms in radiative corrections, and resum them to all orders in perturbation theory at the leading double logarithmic level. We find that resummation of threshold logarithms is imperative for describing measured $J/\psi$ production rates at large transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>New Strategies for New Physics Search with $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \nu \bar\nu$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the new physics sensitivity of the rare decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \nu\bar\nu$ which can be accessible at future $Z$-pole machines like FCC-ee and CEPC. We find that the longitudinal polarization of $\Lambda_b$ baryons produced in $Z$ decays introduces a novel observable, the forward-backward asymmetry $A_\text{FB}^\uparrow$ in the angle between the outgoing $\Lambda$ momentum and the $\Lambda_b$ spin. We provide Standard Model predictions for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \nu\bar\nu$ branching ratio and $A_\text{FB}^\uparrow$, and show that future precision measurements of these observables are complementary and probe new physics scales comparable to other $b \to s \nu\bar\nu$ and $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ processes. We also show that the zero crossing of the forward-backward asymmetry offers a robust test of form factor calculations independent of new physics.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Optimal Transport for Complete Collider Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the success of optimal transport metrics defined for single collinear jets, we develop a multi-scale framework that models entire collider events as distributions on the manifold of their constituent jets, which are themselves distributions on the ground space of the calorimeter. This hierarchical structure of optimal transport effectively captures relevant physics at different scales. We demonstrate the versatility of our method in two event classification tasks, which respectively emphasize intra-jet substructure and inter-jet spatial correlations. Our results highlight the relevance of a nested structure of manifolds in the treatment of full collider events, broadening the applicability of optimal transport methods in collider analyses.</description>

      <title>Complete analytical solution to the Cornell potential and heavy quarkonium structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the recently proposed supersymmetric expansion algorithm (SEA) to obtain a complete analytical solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Cornell potential. We find that the energy levels $E_{nl}(\lambda)$ depend on $n^{2}$ and $L^{2}=l(l+1)$. For a given $n$, the energy decreases with $l$ and the radial probabilities follow the Coulomb pattern but their peaks are shifted toward smaller radius. We study the heavy quarkonium structure on the light of these results, showing that the measured $\bar{b}b$ and $\bar{c}c$ meson masses follow the inverted spectrum pattern predicted by the Cornell potential. Details of the structure of heavy quarkonium like the mean inverse radius and mean squared velocity for the different quarkonium configurations can be obtained from our solution. These details signal to significant relativistic corrections for all the configurations of real heavy quarkonium. We calculate relativistic corrections using perturbation theory finding an expansion in $\alpha^{2}_{s}$ for the heavy quarkonium masses. The mass hierarchies in the fine splittings can be qualitatively understood from this expansion. The quantitative analysis of the Bohr-like levels and of the fine splittings in the $l=0$ sector allow us to make well defined predictions for the masses of some of the missing heavy quarkonium states, to identify the $\psi(4040)$ as the $3^{3}S_{1}$ $\bar{c}c$ state and to identify states that cannot be $\bar{c}c$ states in the $n=3$ level of the measured charmonium spectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics from Neutrinos at Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter direct detection experiments have become excellent low-energy neutrino detectors. We present a few novel ideas to probe Beyond the Standard Model physics from neutrinos at these experiments. First, we discuss signatures arising from the Migdal effect induced by solar neutrinos via Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scatterings (CE$\nu$NS) at the detector. Second, we discuss that placing a radioactive source near a liquid xenon detector may allow to observe the anapole moment of neutrinos expected in the Standard Model via neutrino-electron scattering. Third, we point out that neutrinos coupled to a light dark sector charged under a dark $U(1)'$ symmetry could feature enhanced electromagnetic properties at the loop-level. We further discuss the testability of this scenario with direct detection experiments sensitive to solar neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Exploring the two-body strong decay properties of the possible $\Lambda_cK^{*}$ and $\Sigma_cK^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply the effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the two-body strong decay behaviors of the possible $\Lambda_c K^*$ and $\Sigma_c K^{(*)}$ molecules, as predicted in our previous study [Phys. Rev. D 108, 054011 (2023)]. Our results indicate that the decay width for the coupled $\Sigma_c K / \Lambda_c K^* / \Sigma_c K^*$ molecule with $I(J^P) = 1/2(1/2^-)$ is on the order of several MeV, with the $D_s N$ channel being dominant. For the coupled $\Lambda_c K^* / \Sigma_c K^*$ molecule with $1/2(1/2^-, 3/2^-)$, the decay widths are on the order of tens of MeV, with the dominant channels being $\Sigma_c K$ and $\Sigma_c^* K$, respectively. For the $\Sigma_c K^*$ molecules with $1/2(1/2^-)$, the decay width can reach one hundred MeV, with $\Sigma_c K$ and $\Lambda_c K$ being the dominant decay channels. The decay widths for the $\Sigma_c K^*$ molecules with $1/2(3/2^-)$ and $3/2(1/2^-)$ are on the order of tens of MeV, with the dominant decay modes being $\Sigma_c^* K$ and $\Sigma_c K$, respectively. The branching ratios for all the discussed channels show little dependence on the binding energies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting heavy-flavor conserving weak decays of charmed baryons within the nonrelativistic quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the heavy-flavor conserving weak decays of charmed baryons, specifically the processes $\Xi_{c} \to \Lambda_{c} \pi$ and $\Omega_{c} \to \Xi_{c} \pi$, where the pole model is employed to account for the nonfactorizable contributions. Additionally, the nonperturbative parameters involved are determined within the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model, utilizing exact baryon wave functions obtained by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a nonrelativistic potential. By considering the mixing angle $\theta \in (24.4^\circ, 32.4^\circ)$ for $\Xi_{c}-\Xi_{c}^{\prime}$ mixing, we find that the experimental data can be effectively reproduced. Furthermore, we estimate the branching ratios: $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+} \to \Lambda_{c}^{+} \pi^{0}) = (8.69 \sim 9.79) \times 10^{-3}$, $\mathcal{B}(\Omega_{c}^{0} \to \Xi_{c}^{+} \pi^{-}) = (11.3 \sim 12.1) \times 10^{-3}$, and $\mathcal{B}(\Omega_{c}^{0} \to \Xi_{c}^{+} \pi^{0}) = (4.67 \sim 5.23) \times 10^{-3}$. These predictions can be tested in ongoing experiments at LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence for the $\bar{D}D^*/D\bar{D}^*$ Molecular Nature of $G(3900)$ Through Triangular Singularity Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exotic hadron $G(3900)$, initially observed in the process $e^+ e^- \to D\bar{D}$, has been further supported by analyses from the BESIII Collaboration, which classify it as a $P$-wave molecular state of $D^{+}D^{*-}/D^{-}D^{*+}$. However, theoretical discussions raise concerns about its status as a true particle, emphasizing the need for additional studies. In this Letter, we employ the triangular singularity mechanism to investigate $G(3900)$ across various reaction channels, allowing us to produce significant peaks without relying on the existence of a real particle. We identify $X(4020)$, $Y(4320)$, and the tentative $X(4014)$ as potential sources of these peaks via decay processes to $\gamma G(3900)$ or $\pi G(3900)$. We stress the importance of experimental explorations of $e^+ e^- \to X/Y \to \gamma(\pi) G(3900)$, which are essential for confirming the molecular composition of $D^{+}D^{*-}/D^{-}D^{*+}$ and refining the mass measurement of $G(3900)$.</description>

      <title>Strange quark stars in modified vector MIT bag model: role of $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the properties of strange quark stars (SQSs) using the vector MIT bag model with modification in vector channels. Unlike recent studies which only consider interactions through $\omega$ mesons, we analyze the possibility of $\rho$ and $\phi$ vector channels. We consider two types of higher order non-linear self-interaction terms for the vector mesons. With these modifications, we computed the equation of state (EoS) and mass-radius of strange stars for different values of vector coupling strength. We also calculate the tidal deformability, the Love number $k_2$ and the gravitational redshift of SQSs.</description>

      <title>Super-critical primordial black hole formation via delayed first-order electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delay of the first-order electroweak phase transitions (EWPT) may lead to the emergence of baby universes inside wormhole structures due to the large vacuum energy density in false vacuum domains. Observers outside the false vacuum domains observe them as primordial black holes (PBHs), categorized as super-critical PBHs. We specifically investigate the dynamics of PBH formation due to delayed first-order EWPTs by solving the equations of bubble wall dynamics. We numerically confirm that such super-critical PBHs can be formed by the delayed first-order EWPT assuming spherically symmetric false vacuum domains with the thin-wall approximation for its boundary. Our numerical results show that a PBH formation criterion utilizing characteristic timescales is more appropriate than the conventional criterion based on density fluctuations. Employing our numerical results, we update the parameter regions of new physics models which can be explored by current and future constraints on the PBH abundance.</description>

      <title>Below the Schwinger critical magnetic field value, quantum vacuum and gamma-ray bursts delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic field above the Schwinger critical value $B_{\rm crit} = 10^9$ Tesla is much higher than any magnetic field known by now in the interstellar bulk except in the vicinity of observed magnetars with magnetic fields between $10^9$ and $10^{11}~$Tesla. Above the critical magnetic field, calculated by Schwinger in the lowest order perturbation in quantum electrodynamics (QED), one reaches the threshold for electron-positron pair creation, which has interesting consequences. Therefore, finding out whether one could encounter some consequences of interest also for the values of the magnetic field below the Schwinger critical point, we invoke the next higher-order effect in QED, which is emerging from the Quantum Vacuum Effect. The latter is equivalent to the use of the Euler-Heisenberg effective theory in nonlinear electrodynamics, where the Lagrangian has a term with a higher power, $B^4$. In this case, in the region $B&lt;B_{\rm crit}$, we show that interesting effects appear, among them the Cherenkov radiation and the reduction in the speed of light. The latter effects appear because of the quantum vacuum mimicking a medium. We also present quantitative arguments for such a close analogy. As a rough estimate, we show that the time delay $\tau$ of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) having traveled through the entire cosmological distances in an average strong magnetic field such as $10^6~$Tesla, reaches an experimentally considerable value of $\tau = 2.4$ hours. In the vicinity of magnetars, the magnetic field is much stronger, of the order of $10^9-10^{11}$ Tesla. However, in this case the linear scale of GRB trajectory through such regions would be much smaller. For the latter, we give an estimate for the number of the magnetars along the trajectory and also for the delay. Finally, we shall dwell on the recently raised issue in the literature, namely the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV).</description>

      <title>Decays of the light hybrid meson $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full width of the light isovector hybrid meson $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ with spin-parities $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$ and content $(\overline{u}gu-\overline{d}gd)/ \sqrt{2}$ is evaluated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $b_1^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $f_1(1285)\pi$, $f_1(1420)\pi$, $ \eta \pi$, and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$. To calculate the partial widths of these channels, we use QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to determine strong couplings at the corresponding hybrid-meson-meson vertices. It turns out that the main contribution to the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{ V}}]=109.7 \pm 16.0$ of the hybrid meson comes from the processes $H_{ \mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ partial width of which amounts to $ \approx 67~\mathrm{MeV}$. The effects of the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to b_1\pi $ and $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to f_1\pi, f_1^{\prime} \pi$ are also sizeable: Their partial widths are equal to $13~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $20~ \mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. The decays to $\eta \pi$ and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$ mesons are subdominant reactions, nevertheless they form $\approx 9\%$ of the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{V}}]$. Results obtained in this work may be interesting to unravel the tangle of predictions about $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ existing in the literature, as well as useful in analyses of different resonances.</description>

      <title>Implication of the existence of $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\bar{D}_sDK$ bound state on nature of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and new configuration of exotic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of numerous new hadrons in the last two decades provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the non-perturbative QCD and hadron structure. Many of these hadrons cannot be understood as conventional $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons but instead as hadronic molecules. The most essential ingredient in the hadronic molecule picture is the hadron-hadron interactions. Therefore, It is vital to calculate/verify the underlying hadron interactions both theoretically and experimentally. In this letter, utilizing the model-independent $DK$ potential extracted from the relevant experimental data, we predict an exotic $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\bar{D}_sDK$ three-body hadronic molecule with a mass of $4310^{+14}_{-24}$ MeV. This state is exotic in two ways. First, the quantum number of $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ cannot be formed by conventional $c\bar{c}$ mesons. Second, it cannot be a two-body state $\bar{D}_sD_{s0}^*$ because their interaction is weak rather robust. We further demonstrate that the $B^+ \to {D}^{*-}D^+ K^+$ decay could be a suitable channel for searching for the predicted exotic state.</description>

      <title>Flavour Non-Universality and Higgs Compositeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flavour non-universal extension of the Standard Model combined with the idea of Higgs compositeness. At the TeV scale, the gauge groups $SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$ are assumed to act in a non-universal manner on light- and third-generation fermions, while the Higgs emerges as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneous global symmetry breaking $Sp(4)\to SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R^{[3]}$, attributed to new strong dynamics. We discuss how the radiatively generated Higgs potential has the ingredients to realize the unavoidable tuning necessary to separate electroweak and composite scales. In particular, the flavoured gauge bosons resulting from the deconstruction must lie in the vicinity of the TeV scale, thereby providing interesting phenomenology that can be probed at near future colliders.</description>

      <title>Description of femtoscopic correlations with realistic pion-kaon interactions: the $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show how $\pi^+ K_S$ femtoscopic correlations, recently reported by ALICE collaboration in $ pp $ collisions, can be well described taking into account relativistic corrections and using realistic $ \pi K $ interactions. These are obtained from a dispersive analysis of scattering data, which provides an accurate and model-independent description of the $ \kappa/K^*_0(700) $ resonance pole. The chiral symmetry suppression of the $ \pi K $ interactions at low energies and the non-ordinary features of the $ \kappa/K^*_0(700) $ seem to suggest that the $ \pi^+ K_S $ source radius might be surprisingly smaller than for other hadronic processes when using the standard and simple Lednicky-Lyuboshits factorization approximation.</description>

      <title>$\phi$-meson spectroscopy and diffractive production using two Schr\"odinger like equations on the light-front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the holographic Schr\"odinger equation of light-front chiral QCD, together with the 't Hooft equation of (1+1)-dimensional QCD in the large $N_c$ limit, can simultaneously describe the $\phi$-meson mass spectroscopy as well as diffractive cross-section. We compute the $\phi$-meson diffractive cross-section by utilizing its resulting light-front wave functions (LFWFs), in conjunction with the color glass condensate (CGC) dipole scattering amplitude. Our predictions for the diffractive cross sections show good agreement with the existing experimental data from HERA at various energies from H1 and ZEUS collaborations. Additionally, we show that the obtained $\phi$-meson LFWFs effectively describe its various properties, including the decay constant, distribution amplitudes, electromagnetic form factors, charge radius, and magnetic and quadrupole moments.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we highlight physics improvements in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The upcoming version of NuWro will incorporate the integration of the argon spectral function for quasi-elastic scattering, along with the MINER$\nu$A parametrization of the axial form factor. Additionally, the new release will feature the implementation of the Valencia 2020 model for meson exchange current. The previously used simplistic delta resonance model for single-pion production will be replaced by a more accurate Ghent hybrid model in the upcoming version of NuWro. We also discuss the recent advancements made by the Wroclaw Neutrino Group in applying machine-learning techniques to achieve model-independent reconstruction of lepton-nucleus interactions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss leptogenesis in a majoron model extended by a right-handed $SU(2)_L$ triplet fermion that prevents the appearance of cosmological domain walls due to a change of the $[SU(2)_L]^2 \times U(1)_L$ anomaly factor. We study several different parameter assignments and find that the interactions of neutrinos with the new particles in the majoron+triplet model can significantly alter the way leptogenesis proceeds. We show that for large parts of the considered parameter space, it is essential to solve the set of coupled Boltzmann equations for the evolution of the neutrinos and the additional particles rather than solving the Boltzmann equations for the neutrino evolution only.</description>

      <title>Blazar Boosted ALP and vector portal Dark matter confronting light mediator searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trouble in detecting low mass dark matter due to its low kinetic energy can be ameliorated in the boosted dark matter framework, where a sub-population of galactic dark matter attains very high energy after being up-scattered by energetic standard model particles. However, in such a scenario the upper limits on the cross-section obtained hitherto are typically large. Hence in the minimal extension of standard model where new mediators act as a portal between the dark and visible sectors, the direct detection limits for sub-GeV dark matter might lie within the exclusion region of other ground based searches of the mediator. To evade this deadlock, we allude to blazar boosted dark matter electron scattering in multi-ton neutrino detector Super kamiokande. We consider minimal models such as axion like particle (ALP) and vector portal dark matter being upscattered by high energy blazar jet and analyse the interesting parameter reaches from Super kamiokande in the parameter space of the mediator, surpassing the existing constraints. Besides, this scenario exhibits stronger limits for previously unexplored ALP mediated sub-MeV dark matter search which is difficult due to associated momentum suppression.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the two-zero texture Majorana neutrino mass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been pointed out that there are 7 different two-zero texture neutrino mass matrices compatible with neutrino oscillation data. We perform an update analysis with the recently published Nu-Fit 6.0 results. We also subject the 7 two-zero textures to constraints on neutrino mass from cosmology, endpoint of beta decay spectrum, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. We find that all 7 textures are compatible with the new oscillation parameters. However, we find 5 textures, whose 1-1 entry is non-vanishing, are in severe tension with the constraints from cosmology and neutrinoless double beta decay. With the next generation experiments, these 5 textures could be decisively ruled out. For the remaining 2 textures, one of them could be ruled out, or severely constrained, if the octant of $\theta_{23}$ is determined.</description>

      <title>Composite quarks and leptons with embedded QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model of quark and lepton compositeness based on an $SU(15)$ gauge interaction that confines chiral preons, which are also charged under the weakly-coupled $SU(4)_{\rm PS} \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ gauge group. The breaking of the latter, down to the Standard Model group, is achieved by scalar $SU(15)$ bound states at a scale in the $30 - 100$ TeV range. The embedding of the QCD gauge group in $SU(4)_{\rm PS} $ slows down the running of $\alpha_s$ in the UV. We estimate the effects of the strongly-coupled $SU(15)$ dynamics on the running of the $SU(4)_{\rm PS} \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ gauge couplings, which likely remain perturbative beyond the compositeness scale of about $10^3 - 10^4$ TeV, and even above a unification scale. A composite vectorlike lepton doublet acquires a mass in the TeV range probed at future colliders, and an extended Higgs sector arises from 6-preon bound states.</description>

Abstract: According to recent lore, supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) cannot explain the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background obtained by pulsar timing arrays. We demonstrate that supercooled FOPTs in Majoron-like U(1)' models with a conformal dark sector easily explain the nHz signal at NANOGrav in conjunction with the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing. We find that models with a U(1)' charge of the Higgs doublet close to that of the B-L model are favored.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivities on the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators associated with the anomalous $H\gamma\gamma$, $H\gamma Z$ and $HZZ$ vertices through the process $\mu^- \mu^+ \rightarrow Z\gamma\gamma$ at future muon collider. Signal events involving Higgs-gauge boson interactions and relevant backgrounds events at the muon collider designed with center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ are generated in Madgraph within the framework of the model-independent Standard Model effective field theory and detector effects are also included with corresponding detector cards in Delphes. The limits at 95% C.L. on the coefficients $\overline{c}_{HB}$ and $\overline{c}_{HW}$ are reported to be [-0.0052; 0.0040] and [-0.0034; 0.0023], respectively, and compared with the experimental and phenomenological limits.</description>

      <title>Axion-like-particle dark matter beyond the standard paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are among the most popular candidates that explain the origin of the mysterious dark matter. The most popular ALP production mechanism studied in the literature is the misalignment mechanism, where an ALP field with a quadratic or cosine potential has negligible kinetic energy initially, and it starts oscillating when its mass becomes comparable to the Hubble scale. Recently, there has been an interest in models that go beyond the standard assumptions. These models not only extend the ALP dark matter parameter space, but also provide a rich phenomenology which is absent in the standard scenario. In particular, the ALP fluctuations grow exponentially via parametric resonance and tachyonic instabilities. In this proceeding, we will first demonstrate why the standard paradigm cannot explain dark matter in experimentally interesting parts of the parameter space, and then we will give an overview of the alternative production mechanism with which this issue can be resolved. We will then discuss the exponential growth of the fluctuations in these models. Finally, we will comment on the observational consequences of the exponential growth and show that a sizable region of the ALP parameter space becomes testable even if ALPs have only gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Region analysis of $H\to \gamma \gamma $ via a bottom quark loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $H\to \gamma\gamma$ decay is an ideal process to study the structure of next-to-leading power logarithms induced by quarks due to its simple initial and final states. We perform a region analysis of this process up to two-loop level to inspect the origins of the logarithms. To deal with the endpoint singularities that are prevalent for the next-to-leading power logarithms, we have adopted two different kinds of regulators to exhibit the advantages and disadvantages of each regulator. In the analytic regulator we have chosen, the power of the propagator is changed by $\eta$. And the endpoint singularities are regulated in the form of $1/\eta$. These poles cancel between the collinear and anti-collinear sectors since there is no soft mode in such a regulator. In the $\Delta$ regulator, the soft sector is important. The leading and next-to-leading logarithms can be inferred from only this sector. Moreover, the symmetry between the collinear and anti-collinear sectors is reserved. After imposing a cut on the bottom quark transverse momentum, the leading order result is finite in each sector. We also discuss the next-to-next-to-leading power contributions and find that the potential factorization formulae involve two-dimensional endpoint singularities. Our region analysis could help to develop sophisticated factorization and resummation schemes beyond leading power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Finite T topological Susceptibility with heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion cosmology needs the QCD topological susceptibility between 400 and 1100 MeV. In this range the bottom quark is inconvenient to include in lattice simulations, but not heavy enough to ignore. We estimate its effect on the susceptibility by computing the ratio of the 4-quark susceptibility and the 4+1-quark susceptibility in the caloron gas approximation. We do so by computing small-mass and large-mass expansions of the finite mass and temperature fluctuation determinant and connecting them with a Pad\'e approximant.</description>

      <title>The Light Neutralino Dark Matter in the Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate both the $Z$ and $H$ poles solutions for the Higgsino mass parameter $\mu&gt;0$ and $\mu&lt;0$ for the neutralino dark matter in light of the LHC supersymmetry searches and the direct detection dark matter experiments, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), in the Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA). Our study indicates that the latest experimental constraints from the LHC and LZ Collaborations exclude the light Higgsinos in the $Z$ and $H$ pole regions for the $\mu&gt;0$ case. Interestingly, for the $\mu &lt; 0$ case, a very light Higgsinos can still be consistent with the current constraints from the electroweakino searches and LZ experiment in the $Z$ and $H$ poles. Consequently, the $\mu &lt; 0$ case appears more promising and thus requires the dedicated efforts to make definitive conclusions about their current status from the experimental Collaborations. In this framework, our findings indicate a deviation of up to $2\sigma$ from the central value of \( a_\mu \equiv (g-2)_\mu/2 \), resonating with the experimental results reported by CMD and BDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae are extreme astrophysical objects that provide unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We study supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion-like particles (ALPs) with an electron-muon coupling. We consider three ALP production channels in the SN core: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence channel, which was not considered in previous studies on LFV-ALPs, provides the most stringent constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>CGC-induced longitudinal ridge in p-Pb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory, we investigate the long-range rapidity correlations in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. As expected, the long-range rapidity correlations rebound after bottoming, which is successfully reproduced by the CGC. It is also found that the correlation rebound appears around the sum of the saturation momenta of the projectile and target, and moves to larger rapidities at higher collision energies. Beyond that, the longitudinal rapidity correlations are asymmetrically distributed in p-Pb collisions when the transverse momenta of two particles differ, while become symmetric when the transverse momenta of two particles coincide. This feature of rapidity correlations is unique to asymmetric pA collisions, and directly results from the saturation and the quantum evolution of gluons within the framework of the CGC.</description>

      <title>Nucleon and singly heavy baryons from the QCD instanton vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an effective chiral theory for the nucleon, based on the low-energy effective QCD partition function from the QCD instanton vacuum. We fully consider the momentum-dependent dynamical quark mass whose value at the zero virtuality of the quark is determined by the gap equation from the instanton vacuum, $M_0=359$ MeV. The nucleon emerges as a state of $N_c$ valence quarks bound by the pion mean field, which was created self-consistently by the $N_c$ valence quarks. In the large Euclidean time, the classical nucleon mass is evaluated by minimizing the sum of the $N_c$ discrete-level energies and the Dirac-continuum energy: $M_{\text{cl}}=1.2680$ GeV. The pion mean-field solution turns out broader than the local chiral quark-soliton model. The zero-mode quantization furnishes the nucleon with proper quantum numbers such as the spin and isospin. We compute the moment of inertia $I=1.3853$ fm by using the self-consistent mean-field solution, which yields the $\Delta -N$ mass splitting $M_{\Delta-N} =213.67$ MeV. In the same manner, singly heavy baryons can be described as a bound state of the $N_c-1$ valence quarks with the corresponding pion mean field, with the heavy quark regarded as a static color source. The mass splitting of the singly heavy baryons is obtained to be $M_{\Sigma_Q-\Lambda_Q}=206.20$ MeV, which are in good agreement with the experimental data. The effective chiral theory developed in the present work will provide a solid theoretical framework to investigate gluonic observables of both the light and singly heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter from semi-annihilations in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some scenarios, the dark matter relic abundance is set by the semi-annihilation of two dark matter particles into one dark matter particle and one Standard Model particle. These semi-annihilations might still be occurring today in the Galactic Center at a significant rate, generating a flux of boosted dark matter particles. We investigate the possible signals of this flux component in direct detection and neutrino experiments for sub-GeV dark matter masses. We show that for typical values of the semi-annihilation cross-section, the sensitivity of current experiments to the spin-independent dark matter-proton scattering cross-section can be several orders of magnitude larger than current constraints from cosmic-ray boosted dark matter. We also argue that the upcoming DARWIN and DUNE experiments may probe scattering cross-sections as low as $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$ for masses between 30 MeV and 1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Scalar Effects Beyond Dimension-6 in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a robust framework for probing deviations in the couplings of Standard Model particles from their theoretical predictions. This framework relies on an expansion in higher-dimensional operators, often truncated at dimension-six. In this work, we compute the effective dimension-eight operators generated by integrating out heavy scalar fields at one-loop order in the Green's basis within two extended scalar sector models: the Two Higgs Doublet Model and the Complex Triplet Scalar Model. We also investigate the impact of heavy scalar fields on the fermion sector, deriving the fermionic effective operators up to dimension eight for these models, and detail how contributions can be mapped onto non-redundant bases. To assess the importance of higher-order contributions in the SMEFT expansion, we analyze the dimension-eight effects for electroweak precision observables at the next frontier of precision lepton machines such as GigaZ.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Dependent Long-Range Neutrino Interactions in DUNE and T2HK: Synergy Breeds Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new neutrino interactions would provide evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. We focus on flavor-dependent long-range neutrino interactions mediated by ultra-light mediators (masses below $10^{-10}$ eV) from lepton-number gauge symmetries $L_e-L_\mu$, $L_e-L_\tau$, and $L_\mu-L_\tau$. These interactions, sourced by electrons and neutrons in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and the local Universe, could modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. The upcoming long-baseline experiments, DUNE and T2HK, with their large statistics, reduced systematic uncertainties, and well-characterized neutrino beams, will probe these interactions. We forecast that, while individually DUNE and T2HK could constrain these long-range neutrino interactions, their combination lifts parameter degeneracies that weaken individual sensitivity and provides stronger constraints.</description>

      <title>Muon-specific two-Higgs-doublet model for $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, $W$-boson mass-shift, and Zee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12181v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated one type of 2HDM, the muon-specific two-Higgs-doublet model, as a solution to the muon ($g-2$) and CDF $W$-boson mass anomaly. The additional Higgs boson couplings to muons are enhanced by $\tan \beta$, while the couplings to other fermions are suppressed by $\cot \beta$. One-loop corrections to the $W-\mu-\nu_\mu$ coupling induce a positive shift to the $W$-boson mass, compatible with the CDF measurement. Fixing the charged Higgs mass of $m_{H^\pm}=600$ GeV, our results show that small values of $\tan \beta$ ($\approx 200$) require a large mass splitting of $m_A-m_H \approx 480$ GeV. The small mass splitting case $m_A-m_H \approx 10$ GeV is also possible, provided large $\tan \beta$ ($\approx 5000$). The oblique parameter lies in $T=[0.126,0.198]$ which corresponds to the mass-splitting between the charged and pseudoscalar Higgs in the range typically $10-100$ GeV. This leads to the constrained all Higgs boson masses that cannot be heavier than about 600 GeV. At the end, we also have studied the model in the context of the Zee model, radiative neutrino mass generation at one-loop level, by adding a singly-charged scalar to the model. The model results in the incompatible neutrino mass matrix with solar and KamLAND data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of extending the LHC from a hadron-hadron to a photon-hadron collider and performing studies of inclusive quarkonium photoproduction. We perform an extrapolation from HERA data to predict the yields of photoproduced $J/\psi$ mesons in proton-lead collisions. Similarly, we perform an extrapolation from LHC data to model the large hadronic background. Inclusive photoproduction can be isolated from this background in the LHC detectors, namely, ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb by imposing constraints on the hadronic activity in the main detector and in the far-forward region. This work focuses on the CMS detector.</description>

      <title>Probing Type II Seesaw Leptogenesis Through Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation (LFV) offers a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in models addressing neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate LFV processes within the framework of type II seesaw leptogenesis, where the Standard Model is extended by an $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs field. We focus on key LFV processes including $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$, $\mu^+ \to e^+e^-e^+$, and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion in nuclei, deriving stringent constraints on the parameter space from current experimental data. We scan the 3$\sigma$ range of neutrino oscillation parameters and identify the most conservative bounds consistent with existing measurements. Our results reveal that the MEG experiment currently provides the strongest constraints in the normal ordering (NO) scenario, while the SINDRUM experiment offers comparable sensitivity in the inverted ordering (IO) case. Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e, and COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing larger regions of the parameter space. This work underscores the crucial role of LFV experiments in probing type II seesaw leptogenesis, providing an avenue to explore the connections between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and inflation at experimentally accessible energy scales.</description>

      <title>Nucleon tensor form factors at large $N_{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nucleon tensor form factors in the large-$N_{c}$ limit. In this picture, the nucleon emerges as a state of the $N_c$ valence quarks, which were bound by pion mean fields that were created by the presence of the valence quarks self-consistently. We find that the tensor charge ($g^{u-d}_{T}=0.99$) and the anomalous tensor magnetic moment ($\kappa^{u+d}_{T}=7.61$) are dominated by valence quarks, while the tensor quadrupole moment ($Q^{u-d}_{T}=-7.02$) shows significant sea quark effects. We examine how these quantities vary as the average size of the pion mean field is changed, showing interpolation between non-relativistic quark and Skyrme limits. We also observe that $g^{u-d}_{T}$ and $\kappa^{u+d}_{T}$ depend weakly on the pion mass. In contrast, $Q^{u-d}_{T}$ exhibits strong enhancement near the chiral limit. The numerical results are in good agreement with available lattice QCD data and provide predictions for unmeasured quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods from Quantum Information Theory are used to scrutinize quantum correlations encoded in the two-quark density matrix over light-cone momentum fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$. A non-perturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant non-classical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher $Q^2$ scale, the non-classical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Constituent Quark-model for BaryonsTh. Harmonic confinement and Two-body Meson-exchange Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft Two-body potentials between the constituent quarks of the nucleon are derived using harmonic oscillator, i.e. gaussian, quark wave-functions. The gaussian wave-functions are very suited for applications with the ESC soft-core interactions, which employ gaussian form factors. In these notes using the Fourier transformation to momentum space the local and non-local contributions of the potentials based on the ESC meson-quark-quark vertices are evaluated. Using the ESC16 parameters translated to the quark-level leads to parameter free two-body and three-body diquark and triquark meson-exchange interactions. Applications to the SU(3) baryon-octet states and the $\Delta_{33}$ resonance are performed., within the CQM using a harmonic confinement potential, leading to a satisfactory picture with relativistic constituent quarks. We present two versioins for the $N-\Delta$ splitting: (i) model A with the instanton interaction, and (ii) model B with a large color-magnetic interaction from an almost point like OGE. The size of the baryons $\approx$ 1 fm.</description>

      <title>Unnuclear matter at large-charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utility of the non-relativistic large-charge EFT for physical systems, and neutron matter in particular, relies on controlled Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking deformations due to scattering length and effective-range effects in the two-body system. A recently-found exact solution of the large-charge system is used to compute these effects for two-point correlation functions of large-charge operators in perturbation theory around the large-charge ground state. Notably, the leading effective-range effects are found to enter at second order in the effective range, in agreement with analogous calculations in the three-body system. The Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking deformations are used -- together with input from Quantum Monte Carlo simulations -- to address the range of validity of the EFT with deformations both in general and in the special case of neutron matter. In particular, it is found that nuclear reactions with up to six low-energy neutrons in the final state can be described by the large-charge EFT with Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Cosmological search for sterile neutrinos after DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology. We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\nu,\ \mathrm{sterile}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively. However, the $\Lambda$CDM+Sterile and $w$CDM+Sterile models could not provide evidence supporting the existence of massive sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <title>Probing muonic force with periastron advance in binary pulsar systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars, highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars, can have significant muon abundances in their dense cores, making them promising environments to probe ultralight mediators coupled to muons. The precise measurement of periastron advance in binary pulsar systems provides a sensitive probe of such long-range forces. In this work, we study the periastron advance constraints from binary pulsar systems on the ultralight muonic mediators. We compute the muon number fraction in neutron stars, by properly taking into account the suppression effect of the long-range muonic force. We find that the periastron advance constraints impose the most stringent constraints on ultralight muonic mediators in the mass range of $\simeq(10^{-17},\,2\times10^{-15})$ eV, probing muonic couplings as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-21})$, which surpass the limits from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave measurements, by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-2 Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors in Millihertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-2 ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is a viable dark matter candidate and it can be constrained using gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of spin-2 ULDM by space-based GW interferometers. By considering a direct coupling between spin-2 ULDM and ordinary matter, we derive the corresponding response functions and sensitivity curves for various time-delay interferometry channels and calculate the optimal sensitivity curves for future millihertz GW detectors. Our results demonstrate that the space-based detectors can place stringent constraints on the coupling constant of spin-2 ULDM, reaching $\alpha \sim 10^{-10}$ around a mass of $m \sim 10^{-17} \rm eV$, surpassing current limits from ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. Thus, the space-based GW detectors can serve as powerful tools not only for detecting GWs but also for probing fundamental properties of ultralight dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the classical aspects of Quantum theory and under which description Quantum theory does appear Classical. Although such descriptions or variables are known as "ontological" or "hidden", they are not hidden at all, but are dual classical states (in the sense of the general classical-quantum duality of Nature). The application of the Minimal Group Representation immediately classicalizes the system, Mp(2) emerging as the group of the classical-quantum duality symmetry. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Direct Expression for One-Loop Tensor Reduction with Lorentz Indices via Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we derived a direct expression for one-loop tensor reduction using generating functions and Feynman parametrization in projective space, avoiding recursive relations. However, for practical applications, this expression still presents two challenges: (1) While the final reduction coefficients are expressed in terms of the dimension D and Mandelstam variables, the given expression explicitly contains irrational functions; (2) The expression involves an auxiliary vector R, which can be eliminated via differentiation $\frac{\partial}{\partial R}$, but the presence of irrational terms making differentiation cumbersome. (3) Most practical applications require the tensor form with Lorentz indices.
  In this paper, we provide a rational form of the reduction coefficients with Lorentz indices, free from recursion. Additionally, We provide a pure Wolfram Mathematica implementation of the code. Our practical tests demonstrate that this direct expression achieves significantly higher computational efficiency compared to the traditional Passarino-Veltman (PV) reduction or other recursion-based methods.</description>

      <title>In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with the aim to constrain in-medium properties of bottomonia at high temperature. The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature $T$ and external magnetic fields $eB$ on the chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons, including $\pi^0$, $K^0$, and $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$, in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with physical quark masses. The chiral condensates are intrinsically connected to the screening masses via Ward-Takahashi identities, with the latter characterizing the inverse of the spatial correlation length in the pseudoscalar channel. Using highly improved staggered quarks, we perform simulations on lattices with temporal extents $N_\tau = 8, 12, 16$ and an aspect ratio of 4, covering five temperatures from 145 MeV to 166 MeV. For each temperature, eight magnetic field strengths are simulated, reaching up to $eB \sim 0.8$ GeV$^2$. These simulations allow us to provide continuum estimates for the chiral condensates and screening masses. We observe intricate behavior in the light ($ud$), strange-light ($ds$) and strange ($s$) quark condensates as functions of the magnetic field and temperature, reflecting the competition between magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis effects. This complex behavior is also mirrored in the screening masses of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Notably, the screening masses of $\pi^0$ and $K^0$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $eB$, closely following the variations in their corresponding chiral condensates. Meanwhile, the screening mass of $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$ decreases monotonically with increasing $eB$. These findings provide valuable insights for understanding the behavior of QCD in a thermomagnetic medium and can serve as benchmarks for low-energy QCD models and effective theories.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach for estimating the lower end of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window is presented through the study of center vortex geometry and its dependence on the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Values ranging from $N_f = 2$--$8$ are utilized to infer an upper limit for vortex behavior in the low $N_f$ phase, which may inform the transition to the conformal window. The simulations are performed at a single lattice spacing and pion mass, both fixed for all $N_f$. Visualizations of the center vortex structure in three-dimensional slices of the lattice reveal a growing roughness in the vortex matter as a function of $N_f$, embodied by an increase in the density of vortex matter in the percolating cluster and a simultaneous reduction in secondary clusters disconnected from the percolating cluster in 3D slices. This is quantified by various bulk properties, including the vortex and branching point densities. A correlation of the vortex structure reveals a turning point near $N_f \simeq 5$ past which a randomness in the vortex field becomes the dominant aspect of its evolution with $N_f$. As a byproduct, extrapolations to the vortex content of a uniform-random gauge field provide a critical point at which there must be a drastic shift in vacuum field structure. A precise estimate for the critical value is extracted as $N_f^* = 11.43(16)(17)$, close to various other estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic flow and Number of Constituent Quarks scaling provide crucial insights into the underlying dynamics and degrees of freedom in heavy-ion collisions. This article provides some insights on the transition from hadronic to partonic collectivity, revealing possible key signatures of medium evolution. At low energies around ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \leq 4.0$ GeV), $v_2$ may be negative and NCQ scaling might break down. We expect that as the collision energy rises beyond 4.0 GeV, $v_2$ may become positive and NCQ scaling gradually restores. The transition in $v_2$ behavior, coupled with the breakdown and restoration of NCQ scaling, highlights the increasing significance of partonic interactions at higher energies, marking the onset of partonic collectivity and the emergence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP)-like properties.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic field produced in non-central heavy ion collisions play a crucial role in phenomena such as chiral anomalous effects, directed flow of mesons and splitting of spin polarization of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$. A precise description of these fields is essential for quantitatively studying these effects. We investigate the space-time evolution of the electromagnetic fields by numerically solving Maxwell's equations using the results from the UrQMD model, rather than relying on an ansatz. We present the space-averaged dynamic electromagnetic fields, weighted by energy density, in the central region of heavy-ion collisions. These measurements can serve as a barometer for assessing the effects induced by magnetic fields. Comparing the fields at geometric center of the collisions, the space-averaged dynamical fields weighted by the energy density are smaller at the early stage but damp much slower at the later stage. We discuss the impact of these space averaged dynamical magnetic fields on the spin polarization and spin alignment in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we explore the opportunity to study non-perturbative regime of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) by presenting the simulation results for space averaged dynamical electric field at intermediate collision energies. Finally, the space-averaged dynamical electromagnetic anomaly $\boldsymbol{\textbf{E}}$$\cdot\boldsymbol{\textbf{B}}$ weighted by energy density is also calculated and compared with experimentally measured slope parameter $r$.</description>

Abstract: We calculate for the first time the third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by the amplified scalar field perturbations during inflation using the in-in formalism, and discuss the conditions for the third-order spectrum to be smaller than the second-order one. Assuming an exponential growth of the sub-horizon modes of the scalar field perturbations, we find that the third-order spectrum increases faster than the second-order one as the amplification of the field perturbations increases, and thus the third-order spectrum dominates for detectable gravitational waves, which indicates that the perturbation theory breakdowns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of mirror (a)symmetry in binary black hole mergers: measurability and correlation to gravitational-wave recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precessing binary black-hole mergers can produce a net flux of circularly-polarized gravitational waves. This imbalance between left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves, quantified via the Stokes pseudo-scalar $V_{\rm GW}$, originated from mirror asymmetries in the binary. We scan the parameter space of black-hole mergers to investigate correlations between $V_{\rm GW}$ and chiral magnitudes constructed out of the intrinsic parameters of the binary. To this end, we use both numerical-relativity simulations for (quasi-circular) and eccentric precessing mergers from both the SXS and RIT catalogues, as well as the state-of-the-art surrogate model for quasi-circular precessing mergers NRSur7dq4. We find that, despite being computed by manifestly different formulas, $V_{\rm GW}$ is linearly correlated to the helicity of the final black hole, defined as the projection of its recoil velocity onto its spin. Next, we test our ability to perform accurate measurements of $V_{\rm GW}$ in gravitational-wave observations through the injection and recovery of numerically simulated signals. We show that $V_{\rm GW}$ can be estimated unbiasedly using the surrogate waveform model NRSur7dq4 even for signal-to-noise ratios of nearly 50, way beyond current gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Two Micron-Size Dark Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two extra dimensions of micron scale might simultaneously address the gauge and cosmological hierarchy problems. In our paper we examine various observational bounds in scenarios with one and two large extra dimensions, to see if they are compatible with the micron scale. We show that consistency with astrophysical and cosmological observations requires that two extra dimensions of micron scale must not admit isometries, whereby conservation of the extra dimensional momentum is violated to a large extent, allowing thus the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton to promptly decay to other lighter graviton modes. We also show that within this scenario primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^8 \leq M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \leq 10^{21}$ could make all cosmological dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles through the gamma-ray production from cosmic-ray scattering in the Milky Way dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11691v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALP) are promising candidates to comprise all the dark matter in the universe. We investigate the ALP couplings to photons and electrons via astrophysical measurements through the search for very-high-energy gamma rays arising from high-energy cosmic-ray scattering off ALP populating the halo of the Milky Way. We show that gamma-ray signals from ALP couplings to photons and electrons via inverse Primakoff and Compton processes respectively, can be probed by very-high-energy ($\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray ground-based observatories, providing an alternative and complementary avenue to probe ALP couplings in the eV mass range. Sensitivities of current and near-future ground-based gamma-ray observatories improves upon one order of magnitude the current constraints from gamma-ray satellite experiments for the ALP-photon couplings in the region of masses below 10$^{-9}$ GeV. Their sensitivities reached on the ALP-electron couplings allow probing masses below 10$^{-8}$ GeV, which are lower than the masses probed in gamma-ray satellite experiments.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>The role of finite value of strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$ and baryon number density $(n)$ on the stability and maximum mass of strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study describes the impact of non-zero value of strange quark mass $(m_{s})$ and number density of baryons $(n)$ on the structure, stability and maximum mass of strange stars. We derive an exact relativistic solution of the Einstein field equation using the Tolman-IV metric potential and modified MIT bag model EoS, $p_{r}=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B')$, where $B'$ is a function of bag constant $B$, $m_{s}$ and baryon number density $(n)$. Following CERN's findings, transition of phase from hadronic matter to Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) may occur at high densities in presence of favourable conditions. The standard MIT bag model, with a constant $B$, fails to explain such transition properly. Introducing a finite $m_{s}$ and Wood-Saxon parametrisation for $B$, dependent on baryon number density $(n)$, provides a more realistic EoS to address such phase transition. Both $m_{s}$ and $n$ constrain the EoS, making it softer as $m_{s}$ increases. Solutions to the TOV equations reveal that for massless strange quarks, maximum mass is 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ and corresponding radius is 10.96 Km when $n=0.66~fm^{-3}$. These values decrease to 1.99 $M_{\odot}$ and 1.96 $M_{\odot}$, with corresponding radii of 10.88 Km and 10.69 Km for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively having same $n$ value. It is interesting to note that a corelation exists between $n$ and $m_{s}$. The hadronic to quark matter transition occurs at higher values of $n$, when $m_{s}$ increases such as $n\geq0.484,~0.489$ and $0.51~fm^{-3}$ for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively. Beyond these values, the energy per baryon $(\mathcal{E_{B}})$ drops below $930.4~MeV$, indicating a complete transition to quark matter. For physical analysis, we have considered $n~(=0.578~fm^{-3})$ which lies in the stable region with $B(n)=70~MeV/fm^{3}$. The model provides a viable description of strange stars, satisfying all necessary physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the worldwide Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations detected a stochastic gravitational wave(GW) background in the nanohertz range, which may originate from the early universe's inflationary phase. So in this work, we investigated induce GWs in the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet coupling. Consider the scenario of traversing a domain wall in moduli space, we take the coupling coefficient to be an approximately step function. Within suitable parameter regions, the model exhibits de Sitter fixed points, which allows inflation to undergo an ultra-slow-roll phase, which causes the power spectrum to exhibit a peak. Such a peak can induce nanohertz GWs, which provids an explanation for the PTA observational data. Furthermore, we consider the case of multiple domain wall crossings, and adopting a double-step coupling function. In this case, the resulting GW spectrum has two peaks with frequencies around \(10^{-8} \,\text{Hz}\) and \(10^{-2}\,\text{Hz}\), respectively. Which can be observed by the PTA and the space GW detectors simultaneously.Additionally, the reentry of the power spectrum peaks into the horizon leads to the collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We calculate the abundance of PBHs and found that the masses is in the range of \(10^{-14} \sim 10^{-13} M_\odot\) and around \(10^{-2} M_\odot\) , which constitute significant components of the current dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino statistical property on cosmology and the constraints imposed by cosmological data on neutrino statistics. Cosmological data from probes such as Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) radiation and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) are used to constrain the statistical parameter of neutrino. This constraint is closely related to the degeneracy effects among neutrino statistical property, the sum of neutrino masses, and the Hubble constant. Our results show that purely bosonic neutrinos can be ruled out at 95\% confidence level and purely fermionic neutrinos are preferred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for cancelling the leading order contribution to the potential in composite Higgs scenarios. The mechanism relies on the splitting of a real representation of the global symmetry into a complex representation and its conjugate of the unbroken group. We identify two cosets one of which includes a custodial symmetry. A numerical analysis is performed in a phenomenological three-site model and the resulting fine-tuning is analysed. The cancelling of the leading order potential results in a drastic reduction of the fine-tuning. For a symmetry breaking scale of the strong sector as high as $f=1600$ GeV, fine-tuning can be as good as $10\%$ or even better. We discuss a possible interpretation in the 5D holographic dual. Unique signatures of the model include quarks with baryon number $B=2/3$ with highly distinctive decays which can be looked for at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Scattering from an external field in quantum chromodynamics at high energies: from foundations to interdisciplinary connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the factorization of the $S$-matrix elements in the context of particle scattering off an external field, which can serve as a model for the field of a large nucleus. The factorization takes the form of a convolution of light cone wave functions describing the physical incoming and outgoing states in terms of bare partons, and products of Wilson lines. The latter represent the interaction between the bare partons and the external field. Specializing to elastic scattering amplitudes of onia at very high energies, we introduce the color dipole model, which formulates the calculation of the modulus-squared of the wave functions in quantum chromodynamics with the help of a branching random walk, and the scattering amplitudes as observables on this classical stochastic process. Methods developed for general branching processes produce analytical formulas for the asymptotics of such observables, and thus enable one to derive exact large-rapidity expressions for onium-nucleus cross sections, from which electron-nucleus cross sections may be inferred.</description>

Abstract: We present analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics for a system having cylindrical symmetry with boost-invariant longitudinal expansion and Hubble-like transverse expansion. We also consider analytical solution for Hubble-like spherically expanding system. For these two cases, we calculate analytical expression for transverse momentum spectra of hadrons, at constant temperature freeze-out hypersurface using Cooper-Frye prescription. We compare our results for transverse momentum spectra with experimental results from Large Hadron Collider and CERN SPS where one expects cylindrical and spherical geometry of the fireball, respectively. In the case of low-energy collisions with spherical geometry, we calculate rapidity spectra and compare with the results from CERN SPS.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes, which themselves are candidates for dark matter over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated axion cloud combined with black hole Hawking radiation in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the axion-photon coupling, axion mass, black hole mass, and its dark matter fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}$. For the asteroid mass range $\sim10^{16}-10^{22}~{\rm g}$, where primordial black holes can provide the totality of dark matter, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of $f_{\rm PBH}$ parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the black hole formation mechanism is also considered.</description>

      <title>Transverse structure of the proton beyond leading twist: A light-front Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading twist (twist-3) transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) of the proton beyond the Wandzura-Wilczek (WW) approximation. The subleading twist TMDs are not independent and can be decomposed into twist-2 and genuine twist-3 terms from the equations of motion. The latter involves quark-quark-gluon correlations and contains interferences between two light-front Fock sectors, $|qqq\rangle$ and $|qqqg\rangle$, which are usually neglected in the WW approximation.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of (multi)strange hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV using EPOS4 and AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is anticipated that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collect data from oxygen-oxygen ($O+O$) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV to explore the effects observed in high multiplicity proton-proton ($p+p$) and proton-lead ($p+pb$) collisions that closely related to lead-lead ($Pb+Pb$) collisions. These effects include azimuthal asymmetries in particle production, as well as variations in the abundances and momentum distributions across different hadron species, which are indicative of collective particle production mechanisms induced by the interactions in the presence of a QGP. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC are expected to constrain the model parameters and refine our understanding of theoretical models. In this work, the predicted transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$), particle yield ratios, and $p_T$-differential ratios of (multi)strange hadrons produced in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using AMPT and EPOS4 models are presented. AMPT focuses on preformed hadronic interactions, while EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase. Stronger radial flow in EPOS4 as compared to AMPT is also observed. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but the implementation of full hydrodynamic flow in EPOS4 appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the existing experimental data. Both models predict the final state multiplicity overlap with $p+p$, $p+pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the leading and next-to-leading corrections to the real-time QCD static potential in a high temperature medium in the region where bound states transit from narrow resonances to wide ones. We find sizable contributions to both the real and the imaginary part of the potential. The calculation involves both loop diagrams calculated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory and power corrections to the HTL Lagrangian calculated in QCD. We compare our results with recent lattice data.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>A particle's perspective on screening mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms are a natural method for suppressing long-range forces in scalar-tensor theories as they link the local background density to their strength. Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal coupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the origin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective, considering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms. Additionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening, demonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the Higgs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant implications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's binding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation value of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the parameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent gravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is more significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as we illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.</description>

      <title>Flavour Deconstructing the Composite Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a flavour non-universal extension of the Standard Model combined with the idea of Higgs compositeness. At the TeV scale, the gauge groups $SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$ are assumed to act in a non-universal manner on light- and third-generation fermions, while the Higgs emerges as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneous global symmetry breaking $Sp(4)\to SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R^{[3]}$, attributed to new strong dynamics. The flavour deconstruction means the couplings of the light families to the composite sector (and therefore the pNGB Higgs) are suppressed by powers of a heavy mass scale (from which the Higgs is nevertheless shielded by compositeness), explaining the flavour puzzle. We present a detailed analysis of the radiatively generated Higgs potential, showing how this intrinsically-flavoured framework has the ingredients to justify the unavoidable tuning in the Higgs potential necessary to separate electroweak and composite scales. This happens for large enough values of the $SU(2)_R^{[3]}$ gauge coupling and light enough flavoured gauge bosons resulting from the deconstruction, whose phenomenology is also investigated. The model is compatible with current experimental bounds and predicts new states at the TeV scale, which are within the reach of near future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>On the two-loop BSM corrections to $h\longrightarrow \gamma\gamma$ in a triplet extension of the SM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop BSM contributions to the $h\longrightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay width in the SM extended with a real triplet of $SU(2)$. We consider scenarios in which the neutral components of doublet and triplet do not mix, so that the lighter neutral scalar $h$ has (at least approximately) SM-like couplings to fermions and gauge bosons. We focus on the two-loop corrections controlled by the quartic scalar couplings, and obtain explicit and compact formulas for the $h \gamma \gamma$ amplitude by means of a low-energy theorem that connects it to the derivative of the photon self-energy w.r.t. the Higgs field. We briefly discuss the numerical impact of the newly-computed contributions, showing that they may be required for a precise determination of $\Gamma[h\rightarrow \gamma \gamma]$ in scenarios where the quartic scalar couplings are large.</description>

      <title>Gluonic Hidden-charm Tetraquark States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a new type of hybrid state, which consists of two valence quarks and two valence antiquarks together with a valence gluon, the gluonic tetraquark states, are investigated. Twenty-four currents of the the gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark states in $[\bar{3}_c]_{c q}\otimes[8_c]_{G}\otimes[3_c]_{\bar{c} \bar{q^\prime}}$ configuration are constructed, and their mass spectrum are evaluated in the framework of QCD sum rules with quantum numbers of $J^P=0^{+}$, $0^{-}$, $1^{-}$, and $1^{+}$. The nonperturbative contributions up to dimension 8 are taken into account. The results indicate that there may be exist 14 gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark states, and their corresponding hidden-bottom partners are also evaluated. The possible production and decay modes of the gluonic tetraquark states are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in BESIII, BELLEII, PANDA, Super-B, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Simple high-accuracy method for solving bound-state equations with the Cornell potential in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Cornell quark-antiquark potential in momentum space contains singularities both in its one-gluon-exchange (OGE) and linear confining parts, which prevents a direct use of the convenient Nystr\"om method to solve the corresponding bound-state integral equation for the meson masses. While it has been known for a long time how the Coulomb-type singularity in the OGE potential can be treated with a subtraction technique, only very complicated methods have been developed to deal with the stronger singularity in the linear potential. In this work, we present a simple subtraction method to remove this singularity from the kernel, such that the Nystr\"om method becomes applicable. Derivatives of the wave function, that appear as a result of the subtraction, are represented by means of interpolating functions, for which we found Lagrange polynomials to be very efficient. Test calculations show excellent agreement with exactly known energy eigenvalues. By increasing the number of integration points and the order of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials, extremely high accuracy can be achieved. This method can also be extended to relativistic Bethe-Salpeter type equations with singular kernels.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Electroweak Weinberg Operator on the Electric Dipole Moment of Electron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progresses in the measurements of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron using the paramagnetic atom or molecule are remarkable. In this paper, we calculate a contribution to the electron EDM at three-loop level, introducing the CP-violating Yukawa couplings of new SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. At two-loop level, the Yukawa interactions generate a CP-violating dimension-six operator, composed of three SU(2)$_L$ field strengths, called the electroweak Weinberg operator. Another one-loop diagram with the operator inserted induces the electron EDM. We find that even if new SU(2)$_L$ particles have masses around TeV-scale, the electron EDM may be larger than the Standard Model contribution to the paramagnetic atom or molecule EDMs. We also discuss the relation between the Barr-Zee diagram contribution at two-loop level and the three-loop one, assuming that the SM Higgs has new Yukawa interactions with the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Two Scalar Singlet Model with pNGB Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition within an extended Standard Model framework that includes one real scalar $(\Phi)$ and one complex scalar $(S)$, both of which are SM gauge singlets. The global $U(1)$ symmetry is softly broken to a $\mathcal{Z}_3$ symmetry by the $S^3$ term in the scalar potential. After this $U(1)$ symmetry breaking, the imaginary component of the complex scalar $(S)$ acts as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) dark matter candidate, naturally stabilized by $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry of the scenario. Specially, the spontaneous breaking of the global $U(1)$ symmetry to a discrete $\mathcal{Z}_3$ subgroup can introduce effective cubic terms in the scalar potential, which facilitates a strong first-order phase transition. We analyze both single-step and multi-step first-order phase transitions, identifying the parameter space that satisfies the dark matter relic density constraints, complies with all relevant experimental constraints, and exhibits a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. The interplay of these criteria significantly restricts the model parameter space, often leading to an under-abundant relic density. Moreover, we delve into the gravitational wave signatures associated with this framework, offering valuable insights that complement traditional dark matter direct and indirect detection methods.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of singlet scalar extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics in which the scalar couples only to off-shell states. As a result, low-order tree-level processes involving the singlet scalar vanish, providing a unique phenomenology that may allow to evade existing constraints on new singlet scalar fields. We describe search strategies for such states at the Large Hadron Collider and identify the parameter space that can be explored in the future.</description>

Abstract: One method for determining the characteristic parameters of a hadron production source is to measure the Bose-Einstein correlation functions. In this study, we present fundamental concepts and formulas related to the Bose-Einstein correlations, focusing on the measurement principles and the Lund model from an experimental perspective. We perform Monte Carlo simulations using the Lund model generator in the 2-3 GeV energy range. Through these feasibility studies, we identify key features of the Bose-Einstein correlations that offer valuable insights for experimental measurements. Utilizing data samples collected at BESIII, we perform measurements of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions, with an expected experimental precision of a few percent for the hadron source radius and incoherence parameter.</description>

      <title>A dispersive estimate of the $a_0(980)$ contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dispersive implementation of the $a_0(980)$ resonance to $(g-2)_\mu$ requires the knowledge of the double-virtual $S$-wave $\gamma^*\gamma^*\to\pi\eta/ K K(I=1)$ amplitudes. To obtain these amplitudes, we used a modified coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnes formalism, with input from the left-hand cuts and the hadronic Omnes matrix. The latter was derived using a data-driven N/D method, where the hadronic left-hand cuts were approximated via a conformal expansion. Due to the absence of direct hadronic data in the $\pi\eta$ channel, the expansion coefficients were fitted to various experimental data sets on two-photon fusion processes with $\pi\eta$ and $K K$ final states. The resulting dispersive estimate for the $a_0(980)$ contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$ is $a_\mu^{HLbL}[a_0(980)]_{resc.}=-0.43(1)(2)\times 10^{-11}$, which presents an order of magnitude improvement in precision over the narrow resonance approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two Higgs doublet model with a complex singlet scalar whose imaginary part acts as dark matter (DM). The scattering of DM and quarks, mediated by three CP-even scalars in this model, is suppressed when masses of CP-even scalars are degenerate; that is called the ``degenerate scalar scenario''. Based on this scenario, we show that the strong first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) can be achieved without conflicting with constraints from the DM relic density and the direct detection experiments. We also discuss a shift of scalar trilinear coupling from the Standard Model prediction, which could be a test of this model in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Successful cogenesis of baryon and dark matter from memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and dark matter (DM) from evaporating primordial black holes (PBH) beyond the semi-classical regime incorporating the impact of memory burden. In the simplest scenario of baryogenesis via vanilla leptogenesis with hierarchical right handed neutrino (RHN), it is possible to generate the observed BAU with memory-burdened PBH being sole contributor to the production of RHN. While it is not possible to achieve cogenesis in this minimal setup due to structure formation constraints on relic allowed DM parameter space, we show the viability of successful cogenesis in the resonant leptogenesis regime. We also show that successful cogenesis can be achieved in a simple baryogenesis model without taking the leptogenesis route. Due to the possibility of generating asymmetry even below the sphaleron decoupling era, the direct baryogenesis route opens up new parameter space of memory-burdened PBH. The two scenarios of successful cogenesis can also be distinguished by observations of stochastic gravitational waves produced from PBH density fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first complete two-loop calculation of the electric dipole moment of the electron, as well as the rates of the lepton-flavor violating decays $\mu \to e + \gamma$ and $\tau \to e/\mu + \gamma$, in the unconstrained two-Higgs doublet model. We include the most general Yukawa interactions of the Higgs doublets with the Standard Model fermions up to quadratic order, and allow for generic phases in the Higgs potential. A python implementation of our results is provided via a public git repository.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a singlet-doublet-triplet scotogenic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive phenomenological study of a scotogenic framework including a scalar singlet, a scalar doublet, a fermionic doublet, and two generations of a fermionic triplet, allowing to provide three non-zero neutrino masses and three viable dark matter candidates. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical technique, we probe the parameter space of the model in view of numerous constraints stemming from dark matter, the neutrino sector, and lepton-flavour violating transitions. The dark matter mass distribution of phenomenologically viable scenarios exhibits three very predictive peaks at 550 GeV, 1080 GeV, and 2300 GeV. In all viable parameter regions, the observed relic density is achieved through dominant co-annihilations. Future experiments will be able to probe a large number of the currently viable parameter space, while certain parameter configurations promise interesting collider signatures. For related studies, five typical parameter configurations are given in SLHA format.</description>

Abstract: We study dijet production in pA collisions at forward rapidities at next-to-eikonal accuracy. We restrict ourselves to the next-to-eikonal corrections that are induced by the quark background field of the target. We consider all possible channels, compute scattering amplitudes both in general kinematics and in the back-to-back limit. By using these results, we compute the back-to-back production cross section and obtain a factorized expression with a quark TMD times associated hard factor for each channel.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Electron Energy Spectrum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron spectrum exhibits a complex structure and has controversially proposed origins. This work reproduce the evolution of the electron spectrum based on a spatially dependent propagation (SDP) model. The key point is that our SPD model features two diffusion regions leading to two diffusion timescales, competing with the cooling timescale. This results in a three-segment power-law electron spectrum: (1) The spectrum below tens of GeV is primarily influenced by cooling effects from distant sources. (2) The spectrum dominated by diffusion effects from nearby sources from tens of GeV to TeV. (3) The spectrum above TeV, which is predominantly governed by cooling effects from nearby sources. This evolution is unique to the SDP model, and we offer a comprehensive and clear depiction of electron evolution under a single propagation scenario for the first time.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic nucleon form factors in the extended vector meson dominance model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extended vector meson dominance model is developed to describe electromagnetic nucleon form factors. The model includes families of the $\rho$- and $\omega$-mesons with the associated radial excitations. The free parameters of the model are determined using a global statistical analysis of experimental data on the electromagnetic nucleon form factors in space- and timelike regions of transferred momenta. The vector meson masses and widths are equal to their empirical values, while the residues of form factors at the poles corresponding to the ground states of the $\rho$- and $\omega$-mesons are consistent with the findings of both the Frazer-Fulco unitarity relations and the Bonn potential for coupling constants of the $\rho$- and $\omega$-mesons with nucleons. Theoretical constraints imposed on the model include the quark counting rules, the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule, the scaling law of Sachs form factors at moderate momentum transfers, and the suppression of Sachs form factors near the nucleon-antinucleon threshold. A reasonable description of the nucleon form factors in the experimentally accessible range of transferred momenta, as well as the electric and magnetic nucleon radii and Zemach radii, is obtained.</description>

      <title>Properties of QCD axion in two-flavor color superconductive matter with massive quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of QCD axion at low temperature and moderate density in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with instanton induced interactions by simultaneously considering the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates in both quark-antiquark and diquark channels. We derive the analytical dispersion relations of quarks with four-type condensates at nonzero theta angle $\theta=a/f_a$. The axion mass, quartic self-coupling, and the axion potential are calculated in both the chiral symmetry breaking and two-flavor color superconducting phases. Using the commonly adopted model parameters, we find that due to the emergence of color superconductivity, the chiral phase transition not only does not lead to a significant decrease in axion mass and self-coupling, but rather results in an obvious enhancement of them. As a $\theta$ function, the axion potential exhibits an appropriate period of $\pi$, which is quite different from the case without considering the color superconductivity. The surface tension of axion domain wall is also calculated in the presence of color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Probing Supernova Neutrino Boosted Dark Matter with Collective Excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the supernova neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$BDM) and its direct detection. During core-collapse supernovae, an abundance of neutrinos are emitted. These supernova neutrinos can transfer their kinetic energy to the light dark matter via their interactions, and thus are detected in the neutrino and dark matter experiments. Due to the exponential suppression of the high-energy neutrino flux, the kinetic energy carried by a large portion of SN$\nu$BDM falls within the MeV range. This could potentially produce the collective excitation signals in the semiconductor detectors with the skipper-CCD. We calculate the plasmon excitation rate induced by SN$\nu$BDM and derive the exclusion limits. In contrast with conventional neutrino and dark matter direct detection experiments, our results present a significant enhancement in sensitivity for the sub-MeV dark matter.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse phenomenological signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles, described by an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, when coupled to fermionic matter. The latter is modelled by a tensor current coupled directly to the Kalb-Ramond field or by a pseudovector current coupled to the rank-1 dual of the field-strength tensor. We obtain limits on the coupling constants to fermions and mass of the Kalb-Ramond-like particles by investigating their impact on the spectroscopy of simple atomic systems, the tree-level unitarity of the $S$ matrix for $e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \ell^- + \ell^+$ scattering with $\ell \neq e$ and the differential cross section for Bhabha scattering. Assuming that the couplings to fermions are independent of the fermion species, the strongest $95\%$-CL bounds we find are from LEP data at $\sqrt{s} = 136.23$~GeV, namely $g_{\rm PV}/\Lambda \lesssim 6.3 \times 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}^{-1}$ and $g_{\rm T} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{-12} \left( m/{\rm eV} \right)$, both for $m \ll \sqrt{s}$ (here $\Lambda$ is a characteristic energy scale). These limits can be improved in upcoming lepton colliders due to enhanced precision, as well as higher energies.</description>

      <title>Mapping Dark Matter in the Milky Way using Normalizing Flows and Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, data-driven analysis of Galactic dynamics, using unsupervised machine learning -- in the form of density estimation with normalizing flows -- to learn the underlying phase space distribution of 6 million nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Solving the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation, we calculate -- for the first time ever -- a model-free, unbinned estimate of the local acceleration and mass density fields within a 3 kpc sphere around the Sun. As our approach makes no assumptions about symmetries, we can test for signs of disequilibrium in our results. We find our results are consistent with equilibrium at the 10% level, limited by the current precision of the normalizing flows. After subtracting the known contribution of stars and gas from the calculated mass density, we find clear evidence for dark matter throughout the analyzed volume. Assuming spherical symmetry and averaging mass density measurements, we find a local dark matter density of $0.47\pm 0.05$ GeV/cm$^3$. We compute the dark matter density at four radii in the stellar halo and fit to a generalized NFW profile. Although the uncertainties are large, we find a profile broadly consistent with recent analyses.</description>

Abstract: This search for Magnetic Monopoles (MMs) and High Electric Charge Objects (HECOs) with spins 0, 1/2 and 1, uses for the first time the full MoEDAL detector, exposed to 6.6 fb^-1 proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. The results are interpreted in terms of Drell-Yan and photon-fusion pair production. Mass limits on direct production of MMs of up to 10 Dirac magnetic charges and HECOs with electric charge in the range 5e to 350e were achieved. The charge limits placed on MM and HECO production are currently the strongest in the world. MoEDAL is the only LHC experiment capable of being directly calibrated for highly-ionizing particles using heavy ions and with a detector system dedicated to definitively measuring magnetic charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>Steps Toward Quantum Simulations of Hadronization and Energy-Loss in Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to the flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. A possible tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of fermions at local equilibrium: Second-order gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin polarization of spin-1/2 fermions in a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the second order in the gradient expansion, including second-order derivatives. The second-order derivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane $t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out hypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in a non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to be assessed with numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Unitarization of the one-loop graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes and study of the graviball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes calculated perturbatively in quantum gravity to the one-loop order, we develop further a formalism that allows one to calculate infrared-finite partial-wave amplitudes fulfilling perturbative unitarity. As a result of this process a parameter dubbed $\ln a$ emerges that separate between infrared and typical external momenta. The resulting partial-wave amplitudes are next unitarized by employing the Inverse Amplitude Method and the algebraic-$N/D$ method. Then, the graviball resonance, with a similar pole position, is confirmed in the $S$-wave partial-wave amplitude for all unitarization methods, also with respect to the unitarization of only the leading-order amplitude. Although the spectrum of the theory is independent of the specific value of $\ln a$, the requirement for a well-behaved unitarized effective field theory of gravity identifies the optimal range of $\ln a$ for our next-to-leading-order calculations as $0.5 \lesssim \ln a \lesssim 1.7$. Briefly, we discuss the $D$-wave scattering that is weaker than the $S-$wave scattering, repulsive and non-resonant for $\ln a\approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixings in String Theory with Dirac Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in IIA string theory, we have found only two models that accurately account for all standard model fermion masses and mixings. The models are dual to each other under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors and feature 12 adjoint scalars, the maximum number allowed in the landscape, whose linear combination yields the two light Higgs eigenstates. Dirac neutrino-masses in normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.2)\pm 0.1$ meV satisfying both the experimental as well as swampland constraints.</description>

      <title>Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter: confronting observations of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Gravitational and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation constraints in modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <title>How neutron star properties disfavor a nuclear chiral density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is (automatically) metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity and a (positive) cosmological constant recovered in its spontaneously broken phase. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of (gauged) diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived for $d=4$ dimensions and are then extended to conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions while automatically maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>
