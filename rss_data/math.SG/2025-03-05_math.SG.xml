      <title>The Hopf-Rinow theorem and the Ma\~n\'e critical value for magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject of this article are magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres endowed with the round metric and with the magnetic potential given by the standard contact form. We compute the Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the system and show that a value of the energy is supercritical if and only if all pairs of points on the sphere can be connected by a magnetic geodesic with that value of the energy. Our methods are explicit and rely on the description of the submanifolds invariant by the flow and of the symmetries of the system, which we define for a general magnetic system and call totally magnetic submanifolds and magnetomorphisms, respectively. We recover hereby the known fact that the system is super-integrable: the three-spheres obtained intersecting the ambient space with a complex plane are totally magnetic and each magnetic geodesic is tangent to a two-dimensional Clifford torus. In our study the integral of motion given by the angle between magnetic geodesics and the Reeb vector field plays a special role, and can be used to realize the magnetic flow as an interpolation between the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the contact distribution and the Reeb flow of the contact form.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24102v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterexamples to Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence were recently found in dimensions greater than six by Bro\'ci\'c and Shelukhin. We construct counterexamples in dimension four using almost toric fibrations.</description>

      <title>A new look at unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a symplectic toric manifold we consider half-form quantization in mixed polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, associated to the action of a subtorus $T^p\subset T^n$. The real directions in these polarizations are generated by components of the $T^p$ moment map.
  Polarizations of this type can be obtained by starting at a toric K\"ahler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ and then following
  Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of the torus subgroup. These geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via a generalized coherent state transform (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.
  The polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ give a new way of looking at the problem of unitarity in the quantization commutes with reduction with respect to the $T^p$-action, as follows. The prequantum operators for the components of the moment map of the $T^p$-action act diagonally with discrete spectrum corresponding to the integral points of the moment polytope. The Hilbert space for the quantization with respect to $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ then naturally decomposes as a direct sum of the Hilbert spaces for all its quantizable coisotropic reductions which, in fact, are the K\"ahler reductions of the initial K\"ahler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$. This will be shown to imply that, for the polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, quantization commutes unitarily with reduction. The problem of unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for $\mathcal{P}_0$ is then equivalent to the question of whether quantization in the polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ is unitarily equivalent with quantization in the polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$. In fact, this does not hold in general in the toric case.</description>
