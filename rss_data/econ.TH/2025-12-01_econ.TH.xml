      <title>Local unanimity in Shapley-Scarf housing markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the housing market model introduced by Shapley and Scarf (1974), we propose a new axiom, local unanimity, that extends the unanimity condition widely used in social choice theory. It applies the unanimity condition to any subset of agents in the model who unanimously agree on the best exchange of their endowments. Building on this axiom, we provide several concise characterizations of the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanism under both strict and weak preference domains.</description>

      <title>Proportional redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ethic of proportional redistribution is a compromise between the extremely compensatory ethic of full redistribution and the needs-blind ethic of laissez-faire. In a basic model of redistribution problems with needs, we characterize proportional redistribution with a combination of axioms that formalize minimal requirements of accountability, functionality, and impartiality. Consequently, we provide a new ethical rationalization for the ancient Aristotelian maxim of proportionality.</description>

      <title>Contracting with discretionary bonuses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a continuous time contracting model in which a principal hires a risk averse agent to manage a project over a finite horizon and provides sequential payments whose timing is endogenously determined. The resulting nonzero-sum interaction between the principal and the agent is reformulated as a mixed control and stopping problem. Using numerical simulations, we investigate how factors such as the relative impatience of the parties and the number of bonus payments influence the principal's value and the structure of the optimal bonus payment scheme. A notable finding is that, in some contractual environments, the principal optimally offers a sign-on bonus to front-load incentives.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Trust under Institutional Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of for-profit institutions that broadcast reputations to foster trust among market participants. We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system. These findings highlight the intricate tensions between platform incentives and resulting social utility for marketplace participants.</description>

      <title>Social choice with transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00308v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of social choice when transfers between agents are possible. This includes several canonical applications: public-good provision, management of a common resource, settlement of debts, and division of goods. The question of interest is, given a set of possible alternatives, which should be chosen and what transfers, if any, should be made? A classical solution in the literature is the Shapley value of the stand-alone game. We show that it is the only solution satisfying certain desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Liquidation Efficiency and the Bank-Bond Margin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I develop a tractable adverse-selection model comparing secured bank loans and bonds when both pledge collateral but differ in effective liquidation efficiency. A small wedge in recovery rates generates coexistence, a sharp bank-bond cutoff, and distinctive comparative statics in issuance, pricing, collateral, and default. Changes in insolvency regimes or creditor coordination shift the composition of external finance and welfare, with clear implications for bank-based versus market-based intermediation and financial stability.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Analysis of Third-Party Regulation in Organic Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As people become more conscious of their health and the environment, the demand for organic food is expected to increase. However, distinguishing organic products from conventionally produced ones can be hard, creating a problem where producers may have the incentive to label their conventional products as organic to sell them at a higher price. Game theory can help to analyze the strategic interactions between producers and consumers in order to help consumers verifying these claims. Through a game theory analysis approach, this paper provides evidence of the need for a third party to equalize markets and foster trust in organic supply chains. Therefore, government regulation, including regular and random monitoring and certification requirements, plays a crucial role in achieving the desired level of trust and information exchange among supply chain agents, which ultimately determines the growth trajectory of the sector.</description>

      <title>On the core of the Shapley-Scarf housing market model with full preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine core concepts in the classical model of \cite{shapley1974cores} under full preferences. Among the standard notions, the strong core may be empty, whereas the weak core, though always nonempty, can be overly large and include unreasonable allocations. Our main findings are: (1) The exclusion core of Balbuzanov and Kotowski (2019) -- a recent concept shown to outperform standard cores in complex environments under strict preferences -- can also be empty. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for its nonemptiness, showing that it is more often nonempty than the strong core. (2) We introduce two new core concepts, built on the exclusion core and the strong core respectively, by refining the assumptions on how indifferent agents may block. Both are nonempty and Pareto efficient, and coincide with the strong core whenever the latter is nonempty. (3) These core concepts are ordered by set inclusion, with the strong core as the smallest and the weak core as the largest.</description>

      <title>Optimal Information Design in Sender-Receiver Cheap Talk Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the dynamics of cheap talk interactions between an oblivious receiver and a sender with different amounts of information. Even though it may seem that having additional information about the state of the game is always beneficial to the sender, we show that there are cases in which garbling the information of a fully informed sender can improve not only receiver's utility in equilibrium, but also that of the sender herself. We also provide efficient algorithms that output the optimal amount of information in sender-receiver scenarios with binary actions and extend some of these results to settings with multiple senders and one receiver.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>
