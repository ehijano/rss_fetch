      <title>Two- and three-meson scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study systems of two and three mesons composed of pions and kaons at maximal isospin using four CLS ensembles with $a\approx 0.063\;$fm, including one with approximately physical quark masses. Using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, we determine the energy spectrum of these systems including many levels in different momentum frames and irreducible representations. Using the relativistic two- and three-body finite-volume formalism, we constrain the two and three-meson K matrices, including not only the leading $s$ wave, but also $p$ and $d$ waves. By solving the three-body integral equations, we determine, for the first time, the physical-point scattering amplitudes for $3\pi^+$, $3K^+$, $\pi^+\pi^+ K^+$ and $K^+ K^+ \pi^+$ systems. These are determined for total angular momentum $J^P=0^-$, $1^+$, and $2^-$. We also obtain accurate results for $2\pi^+$, $\pi^+ K^+$, and $2K^+$ phase shifts. We compare our results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, and to phenomenological fits.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Due to the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Generalized HMC using Nambu mechanics for lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I describe a generalization of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm in which the molecular dynamics (MD) steps utilize Nambu generalized Hamiltonian dynamics. Characterized by multiple Hamiltonian functions, this formalism allows me to include forces from non-local objects in the MD evolution while preserving the target probability distribution. In this way, the changes proposed by the MD at one location can be made using instantaneous knowledge of the long-distance behavior of the gauge field to a degree beyond that usually provided by the fermion determinant. This represents a promising method for reducing critical slowing down in lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta&lt;0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the five-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized valence GPDs and form factors of pion in the modified chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the valence generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) of pion at zero skewness applying a theoretical approach in which the valence GPDs are related to valence quark distribution functions, directly. To this end, we use the results of modified chiral quark model ($\chi QM$) for the valence quark distributions of pion obtained in our previous work. We also determine the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of pion and compare the results of our theoretical model for valence GPDs and form factors of pion with the results of some other models and available experimental data.</description>
