      <title>Numerical Analysis on the Spatiotemporal Characteristics of the Portevin-Le Chatelier Effect in Ti-12Mo Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplified 3D FE model based on McCormick's model is developed to numerically predict the spatiotemporal behaviors of the PLC effect in Ti-12Mo alloy tensile tests at 350 degrees C with strain rates from the order of $10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$ to $10^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The material parameter identification procedure is firstly presented in details, and the simulated results are highly consistent with experimental ones, especially in terms of stress drop magnitudes and PLC band widths. The distribution of simulated stress drop magnitudes at a constant tensile velocity (0.01 mm/s) follows a normal distribution and its peak value is in the range of 26-28 MPa. Furthermore, the simulated band width slightly fluctuates with the increase of true strain and its average value is about 1.5 mm. Besides, the staircase behavior of strain-time curves and the hopping propagation of the PLC band are observed in Ti-12Mo alloy tensile process, which are related to the strain localization and stress drop magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Connecting Q to TCF for MEMS and piezoelectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two critical characteristics for any MEMS resonator are the quality factor ($Q$) and the temperature coefficient of frequency ($TCF$). The connection between $Q$ and $TCF$ is demonstrated here with a phenomenological anharmonic oscillator model. Specifically, it is shown that the same nonlinear terms responsible for the $TCF$ set an upper limit on the resonator's $Q$. A concise formula is found to estimate this loss and is shown to be closely related to Woodruff's formula for Akhiezer damping. The use of this formula is illustrated by extending the model to an important class of MEMS; piezoelectric resonators. Finally, the model is applied to published data for an AlN-on-diamond piezoelectric resonator. The focus here is on MEMS resonators, but the method should apply broadly to any resonance with non-zero $TCF$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Friis Transmission Formula Using Active Antenna Available Power and Unnamed Power Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the concept of active antenna available power to derive a generalization of the Friis transmission formula for multiport antenna systems. With beamformer weights chosen such that the array patterns are the same when transmitting and receiving, the active antenna available power at the receiving antenna divided by the input power at the transmitter is symmetric under link direction reversal in the near field as well as the far field. These results generalize the Friis transmission formula to beamformed multiport antenna systems in an arbitrary reciprocal propagation environment.</description>
