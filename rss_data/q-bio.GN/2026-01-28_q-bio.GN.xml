      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Read Trimming in Single-Stranded Bisulfite Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-stranded whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (ssWGBS) enables DNA methylation profiling in low-input and highly fragmented samples, including cell-free DNA, but introduces stochastic enzymatic artifacts that complicate preprocessing and downstream interpretation. In post-bisulfite library construction, Adaptase-mediated tailing blurs the boundary between biological sequence and synthetic additions, rendering read trimming a persistent source of variability across analytical pipelines. We show that this variability reflects an intrinsic limit of per-read boundary inference rather than an algorithmic shortcoming: boundary localization is fundamentally asymmetric between paired-end reads, with Read 2 exhibiting kinetically structured artifacts that support constrained read-level inference, while apparent contamination in Read 1 arises conditionally from geometry-driven read-through events and is not well-defined at the single-read level. Even within Read 2, bisulfite-induced compositional degeneracy creates an indistinguishable regime in which genomic and synthetic origins share support under the same observable sequence evidence, implying a strictly positive Bayes error under any deterministic per-read decision rule and placing a fundamental limit on per-read boundary fidelity. By explicitly characterizing these limits, we reframe read trimming in ssWGBS as a constrained inference problem and introduce a conservative framework that operates only where supported by observable evidence (including short-range nucleotide texture), exposes interpretable trade-offs between genomic retention and residual artifact risk, and avoids forced resolution where boundaries are intrinsically unresolvable. Together, these results clarify why fixed trimming heuristics persist in practice and provide a principled foundation for uncertainty-aware preprocessing in ssWGBS.</description>

      <title>GenPairX: A Hardware-Algorithm Co-Designed Accelerator for Paired-End Read Mapping</title>

Abstract: Genome sequencing has become a central focus in computational biology. A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>LaCoGSEA: Unsupervised deep learning for pathway analysis via latent correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Pathway enrichment analysis is widely used to interpret gene expression data. Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.
  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes. Overall, LaCoGSEA provides state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised pathway enrichment analysis.
