      <title>PyTIE: A Python Program for the Evaluation of Degree-Based Topological Descriptors and Molecular Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed PyTIE (Python Topological Indices Expressions) which is defined as the collections of Python packages such as PyTIE D, PyTIE DS, PyTIE SMS DE, and PyTIE SMS DSE, which are open-source software packages and cross-platform Python package designed to expedite the retrieval of results for mathematics, chemistry and chemical engineering researchers within constant time. This open-source tool extends its utility to chemistry and chemical engineering researchers with limited mathematical proficiency. PyTIE facilitates the loading of molecular graphs, specifying parameters such as minimum degree, maximum degree, and the number of vertex pairs (edge partitions). The edge partitions of a molecular graph based on degree sum also plays a crucial role in predicting heat of formation and enthalpy of formation along with DFT techniques. It systematically computes expressions and numerical values for various topological indices, including degree-based and neighborhood degree-based indices, as well as Shannon's entropy, providing visual representations of the results. Emphasizing topological indices for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship and Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship analyses, PyTIE proves particularly relevant in these studies. Serving as a Python package, it seamlessly integrates with libraries such as NumPy, math and SymPy offering extensive options for data analysis. The efficiency of PyTIE is demonstrated through illustrative examples in various contexts.</description>

      <title>Analytic Computation of Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra Using Configuration Interaction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first derivation and implementation of analytic gradient methods for the computation of the atomic axial tensors (AATs) required for simulations of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra using configuration interaction methods including double (CID) and single and double (CISD) excitations. Our new implementation includes the use of non-canonical perturbed orbitals to improve the numerical stability of the gradients in the presence of orbital near-degeneracies, as well as frozen-core capabilities. We validated our analytic CID and CISD formulations against two new finite-difference approaches. Using this new implementation, we investigated the significance of singly excited determinants and the role of CI-coefficient optimization in VCD simulations by comparisons among Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory, CID, and CISD theories. For our molecular test set including (P )-hydrogen peroxide, (S )-methyloxirane, (R)-3-chloro-1-butene, (R)-4-methyl-2-oxetanone, and (M )-1,3-dimethylallene we noted sign discrepancies between the HF and MP2 methods compared to that of the new CID and CISD methods for four of the five molecules as well as similar discrepancies between the CID and CISD methods for (M )-1,3-dimethylallene.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Assisted Separation of Weakly Magnetic Metal Ions in Porous Media. Part 2: Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of the magnetophoresis of metal ions in porous media under static, nonuniform magnetic fields. The multiphysics simulations couple momentum transport, mass diffusion, and magnetic field equations, with the porous medium modeled using two distinct approaches: a Stokes-based formulation incorporating effective diffusivity, and a Brinkman-based formulation that explicitly accounts for permeability and medium-induced drag. Comparison with recent experimental data [Nwachuwku et al. Submitted, 2025] reveals that the Stokes model partially fails to capture key trends, while the Brinkman model, with permeability accurately reproduces observed transport behavior on various porous media. Our simulations predict that both paramagnetic (MnCl2) and diamagnetic (ZnCl2) ions may form field-induced clusters under magnetic gradients over a range of concentrations of 1mM-100mM and magnetic field gradients of up to 100 T2/m. The dominant driving force is found to be the magnetic gradient (Kelvin) force, while the paramagnetic force from concentration gradients contributes minimally. In binary mixtures, hydrodynamic interactions between paramagnetic and diamagnetic clusters significantly alter transport dynamics. Specifically, paramagnetic clusters can pull diamagnetic clusters along the magnetic field gradient, enhancing diamagnetic migration and suppressing the motion of paramagnetic species. These findings highlight the importance of porous media modeling and interspecies interactions in predicting magnetophoretic transport of ionic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Reference Equations of State for Density Prediction in Regasified LNG Mixtures Using High-Precision Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of three reference equations of state (EoS), AGA8-DC92, GERG-2008, and SGERG-88, in predicting the density of regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) mixtures. A synthetic nine-component RLNG mixture was gravimetrically prepared. High-precision density measurements were obtained using a single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter over a temperature range of (250 to 350) K and pressures up to 20 MPa. The experimental data were compared with EoS predictions to evaluate their accuracy. AGA8-DC92 and GERG-2008 showed excellent agreement with the experimental data, with deviations within their stated uncertainty. In contrast, SGERG-88 exhibited significantly larger deviations for this RLNG mixture, particularly at low temperatures of (250 to 260) K, where discrepancies reached up to 3 %. Even at 300 K, deviations larger than 0.4 % were observed at high pressures, within the model's uncertainty, but notably higher than those of the other two EoSs. The analysis was extended to three conventional 11-component natural gas mixtures (labeled G420 NG, G431 NG, and G432 NG), previously studied by our group using the same methodology. While SGERG-88 showed reduced accuracy for the RLNG mixture, it performed reasonably well for these three mixtures, despite two of them have a very similar composition to the RLNG. This discrepancy is attributed to the lower CO2 and N2 content typical in RLNG mixtures, demonstrating the sensitivity of EoS performance to minor differences in composition. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate EoS models for accurate density prediction in RLNG applications.</description>

      <title>Natural-Orbital-Based Neural Network Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective configuration interaction methods approximate correlated molecular ground- and excited states by considering only the most relevant Slater determinants in the expansion. While a recently proposed neural-network-assisted approach efficiently identifies such determinants, the procedure typically relies on canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals, which are optimized only at the mean-field level. Here we assess approximate natural orbitals - eigenfunctions of the one-particle density matrix computed from intermediate many-body eigenstates - as an alternative. Across our benchmarks for H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CO, and C$_3$H$_8$ we see a consistent reduction in the required determinants for a given accuracy of the computed correlation energy compared to full configuration interaction calculations. Our results confirm that even approximate natural orbitals constitute a simple yet powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of neural-network-assisted configuration interaction calculations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High Dose-Rates, the FLASH Effect, and Hydrogen Peroxide Yields: Do Experiments and Simulations Really Disagree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation chemistry of model systems irradiated with ultra-high dose-rates (UHDR) is key to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the sparing of healthy tissue, which is called the FLASH effect. It is envisioned to be used for efficient treatment of cancer by FLASH radiotherapy. However, it seems that even the most simple model systems, water irradiated with varying dose-rates (DR), pose a challenge. This became evident, as differences within measured and predicted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields (g-values) for exposure of liquid samples to conventional DR and UHDR were reported. Many of the recently reported values contradict older experiments and current Monte-Carlo simulations(MCS). In the present work, we aim to identify possible reasons of these discrepancies and propose ways to overcome this issue. Hereby a short review of recent and classical literature concerning experimental and simulational studies is performed. The studies cover different radiation sources, from gamma rays, high-energy electrons, heavy particles (protons and ions) with low and high linear energy transfer (LET), and samples of hypoxic &amp; oxygenated water, with cosolutes such as bovine-serum albumine (BSA). Results are for additional experimental parameters, such as solvent, sample container and analysis methods used to determine the respective g-values of H2O2. Similarly the parameter of the MCS by the step-by-step approach, or the independent-reaction time (IRT) method are discussed. Here, UHDR induced modification of the radical-radical interaction and dynamics, not governed by diffusion processes, may cause problems. Approaches to test these different models are highlighted to allow progress: by making the step from a purely descriptive discourse of the effects observed, towards testable models, which should clarify the reasons of how and why such a disagreement came to light in the first place.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs: A perspective towards nonequilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics in chiral tellurium by linear and circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy: crystal orientation and handedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonal tellurium (Te) has attracted researchers' attention due to its transport and optical properties, which include electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy, spin polarization and bulk photovoltaic effect. It is the anisotropic and chiral crystal structure of Te that drive these properties, so the determination of its crystallographic orientation and handedness is key to their study. Here we explore the structural dynamics of Te bulk crystals by angle-dependent linearly polarized Raman spectroscopy and symmetry rules in three different crystallographic orientations. The angle-dependent intensity of the modes allows us to determine the arrangement of the helical chains and distinguish between crystallographic planes parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis. Furthermore, under different configurations of circularly polarized Raman measurements and crystal orientations, we observe the shift of two phonon modes only in the (0 0 1) plane. The shift is positive or negative depending on the handedness of the crystals, which we determine univocally by chemical etching. Our analysis of three different crystal faces of Te highlights the importance of selecting the proper orientation and crystallographic plane when investigating the transport and optical properties of this material. These results offer insight into the crystal structure and symmetry in other anisotropic and chiral materials, and open new paths to select a suitable crystal orientation when fabricating devices.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Interaction Between Thin Conducting Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state and excited state resonance dipole-dipole interaction energy between two elongated conducting molecules are explored. We review the current status for ground state interactions. This interaction is found to be of a much longer range than in the case when the molecules are pointlike and nonconducting. These are well known results found earlier by Davies, Ninham, and Richmond, and later, using a different formalism, by Rubio and co-workers. We show how the theory can be extended to excited state interactions. A characteristic property following from our calculation is that the interaction energy dependence with separation ($R$) goes like $f(R)/R^2$ both for resonance and for the van der Waals case in the long range limit. In some limits $f(R)$ has a logarithmic dependency and in others it takes constant values. We predict an unusual slow decay rate for the energy transfer between conducting molecules.</description>
