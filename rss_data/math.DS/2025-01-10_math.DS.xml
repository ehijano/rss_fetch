      <title>Transition pathways for a class of degenerate stochastic dynamical systems with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to deriving the Onsager--Machlup function for a class of degenerate stochastic dynamical systems with (non-Gaussian) L\'{e}vy noise as well as Brownian noise. This is obtained based on the Girsanov transformation and then by a path representation. Moreover, this Onsager--Machlup function may be regarded as a Lagrangian giving the most probable transition pathways. The Hamilton--Pontryagin principle is essential to handle such a variational problem in degenerate case. Finally, a kinetic Langevin system in which noise is degenerate is specifically investigated analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Restricted Permutations and Permanents of Infinite Amenable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma $ be an infinite discrete group and $\mathsf{A}\subset \Gamma $ a nonempty finite subset. The set of permutations $\sigma $ of $\Gamma $ such that $s^{-1}\sigma (s)\in \mathsf{A}$ for every $s\in \Gamma $ can be identified with a shift of finite type $X_\mathsf{A}\subset \mathsf{A}^{\Gamma}$ over $\Gamma $. In this paper we study dynamical properties of such shift spaces, like invariant probability measures, topological entropy, and topological pressure, under the hypothesis that $\Gamma $ is amenable.
  In this case the topological entropy $\textrm{h}_{\textrm{top}}(X_\mathsf{A})$ can be expressed as logarithmic growth rate of permanents of certain finite (0,1)-matrices associated with right F{\o}lner sequences in $\Gamma $. Motivated by the difficulty of computing such permanents we introduce the notion of the permanent $\textrm{per}(f)$ for nonnegative elements $f$ in the real group ring $\mathbb{R}\Gamma $ of $\Gamma $ whose support is the alphabet $\mathsf{A}$ of the shift space $X_\mathsf{A}$, and compare, for arbitrary $f \in \mathbb{R}\Gamma $, the Fuglede-Kadison determinant $\textrm{det} _\textrm{FK}(f)$ with the permanent $\textrm{per}(|f|)$ of the absolute value $|f|$ of $f$. Although this approach is effective in only few examples, discussed below, it is interesting from a conceptual point of view that the permanent $\textrm{per}(f)$ of a nonnegative element $f\in \mathbb{R}\Gamma $ can be viewed as topological pressure of the restricted-permutation shift space $X_\mathsf{A}$ associated with the function $\log f$ on the alphabet $\mathsf{A}=\textrm{supp}(f)$ of $X_\mathsf{A}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Wong-Zakai approximations of stochastic nonlocal PDEs with long time memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a combination of Galerkin's method and Dafermos' transformation is first used to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a class of stochastic nonlocal PDEs with long time memory driven by additive noise. Next, the existence of tempered random attractors for such equations is established in an appropriate space for the analysis of problems with delay and memory. Eventually, the convergence of solutions of Wong-Zakai approximations and upper semicontinuity of random attractors of the approximate random system, as the step sizes of approximations approach zero, are analyzed in a detailed way.</description>

      <title>Chain recurrence and structure of omega-limit sets of multivalued semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of !-limit sets of multivalued semiflows like chain recurrence or the existence of cyclic chains. First, we prove that under certain conditions the omega-limit set of a trajectory is chain recurrent, applying this result to an evolution differential inclusion with upper semicontinous right-hand side. Second, we give conditions ensuring that the omega-limit set of a trajectory contains a cyclic chain. Using this result we are able to check that the omega-limit set of every trajectory of a reaction-diffusion equation without uniqueness of solutions is an equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On cusps of caustics by reflection in two dimensional projective Finsler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Finsler, not necessarily symmetric, metric in the plane or its convex subset is called projective if its geodesics are straight segments. We consider Finsler billiards in a convex planar domain endowed with a projective Finsler metric. A caustic by reflection is the envelope of the oriented lines, the billiard trajectories, that start at a point inside the billiard and undergo a fixed number of reflections. We show that such a caustic has at least four cusps. This problem is motivated by the "Last Geometric Statement of Jacobi" that the conjugate locus of a non-umbilic point of a triaxial ellipsoid has exactly four cusps. The present note extends the recent results in this direction concerning Euclidean billiards.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Systems for Quasi Variational Inequalities with Application to Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new class of projected dynamical systems of third order is investigated for quasi (parametric) variational inequalities in which the convex set in the classical variational inequality also depends upon the solution explicitly or implicitly. We study the stability of a continuous method of a gradient type. Some iterative implicit and explicit schemes are suggested as counterparts of the continuous case by inertial proximal methods. The convergence analysis of these proposed methods is established under sufficient mild conditions. Moreover, some applications dealing with the generalized Nash equilibrium problems are presented.</description>

      <title>Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</description>

      <title>Mean field limits of co-evolutionary signed heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many science phenomena are modelled as interacting particle systems (IPS) coupled on static networks. In reality, network connections are far more dynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals and make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model myriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. These networks are used in different areas including telecommunication, neuroscience, computer science, biochemistry, social science, as well as physics, where Kuramoto-type networks have been widely used to model interaction among a set of oscillators. In this paper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of a sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous co-evolutionary networks, which receive both positive and negative feedback from the dynamics of the oscillators on the networks. We show under mild conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the co-evolutionary network exists and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto networks converges to this MFL. Such MFL is described by solutions of a generalized Vlasov equation. We treat the graph limits as signed graph measures, motivated by the recent work in [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349]. In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled on non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent networks independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work seems the first to rigorously address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boolean networks: new tools for the steady state analysis of multivalued networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean networks can be viewed as functions on the set of binary strings of a given length, described via logical rules. They were introduced as dynamic models into biology, in particular as logical models of intracellular regulatory networks involving genes, proteins, and metabolites. Since genes can have several modes of action depending on their expression levels, binary variables are often not sufficiently rich, requiring the use of multivalued networks instead.
  In this paper, we explore the multivalued generalization of Boolean networks by writing the standard $(\wedge, \vee, \lnot)$ operations on $\{0, 1\}$ in terms of the operations $(\odot, \oplus, \neg)$ on $\big\{0,\frac{1}{m}, \frac{2}{m}, \dots, \frac{m-1}{m}, 1\big\}$ from multivalued logic. We recall the basic theory of this mathematical framework, and give a novel algorithm for computing the fixed points that in many cases has essentially the same complexity as in the binary case. Our approach provides a biologically intuitive representation of the network. Furthermore, it uses tools to compute lattice points in rational polytopes, tapping a rich area of algebraic combinatorics as a source for combinatorial algorithms for network analysis. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.</description>

      <title>Slow-growing counterexamples to the strong Eremenko conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\colon\mathbb{C} \to\mathbb{C}$ be a transcendental entire function. In 1989, Eremenko asked the following question concerning the set $I(f)$ of points that tend to infinity under iteration: can every point of $I(f)$ be joined to $\infty$ by a curve in $I(f)$? This is known as the strong Eremenko conjecture and was disproved in 2011 by Rottenfu{\ss}er, R\"uckert, Rempe and Schleicher. The function has relatively small infinite order: it can be chosen such that $\log \log \,\lvert f(z)\rvert = (\log \lvert z\rvert)^{1+o(1)}$ as $f(z)\to \infty$. Moreover, $f$ belongs to the \emph{Eremenko--Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$}. Rottenfu{\ss}er et al also show that the strong Eremenko conjecture does hold for any $f\in\mathcal{B}$ of finite order. We consider how slow a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ can grow. Suppose that $\Theta\colon [t_0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ satisfies $\Theta(t) \to 0$ and \[ (\log t)^{-\beta \Theta(\log t)}/\Theta(t) \to 0 \quad\text{ as $t\to \infty$} \] for some $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$, along with a certain regularity assumption. Then there exists a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ as above such that \[ \log \log \vert f(z)\vert = O ( (\log \vert z \vert)^{1 + \Theta( \log \vert z \vert )}) \] as $\vert f(z)\vert \to\infty$. The hypotheses are satisfied, in particular, for $\Theta(t) = 1/(\log \log t)^{\alpha}$, for any $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be the attractor of the IFS $\{f_{d}(z) = (-n+i)^{-1}(z+d): d\in D\}$, $D\subset\{0, 1, \ldots, n^{2}\}$ and let $\dim$ denote the box-counting dimension. It is known that for all $\lambda\in[0, 1]$, that the set of complex numbers $\alpha$ for which $\dim(C\cap(C+\alpha)) = \lambda\dim(C)$ is dense in the set of $\alpha$ for which $C \cap (C + \alpha) \neq \emptyset$ when $d \leq n^{2}/2$ for all $d\in D$ and $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; n$ for all $\delta \neq \delta^{'} \in D - D$. We show that this result still holds when we replace $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; n$ with $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; 1$. In fact, for sufficiently large $n$, the result even holds when we remove the assumption $d\leq n^{2}/2$ and replace $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; n$ by $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; 2$. Additionally, we make similar statements where $\dim$ denotes the Hausdorff dimension or packing dimension. Our insights also find application in classifying the self-similarity of $C\cap(C+\alpha)$. Namely we connect the occurrence of self-similarity to the notion of strongly eventually periodic sequences seen for analogous objects on the real line. We also provide a new proof of a result of W. Gilbert that inspired this work.</description>

Abstract: We establish the independence of multipliers for polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb C^n$ and endomorphisms of $\mathbb P^n.$ This allows us to extend results about the bifurcation measure and the critical height obtained in \cite{arXiv:2305.02246} to the case of polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb C^n$ for $n\geq 3$. An important step in the proof is the irreducibility of the spaces of endomorphisms with $N$ marked periodic points, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a general spectral gap theorem for actions of products of groups which may replace Kazhdan's property (T) in various situations. As a main application, we prove that a confined subgroup of an irreducible lattice in a higher rank semisimple Lie group is of finite index. This significantly strengthens the classical normal subgroup theorem of Margulis and removes the property (T) assumption from the recent counterpart result of Fraczyk and Gelander. We further show that any confined discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple Lie group satisfying a certain irreducibility condition is an irreducible lattice. This implies a variant of the Stuck-Zimmer conjecture under a strong irreducibility assumption of the action.</description>

      <title>A model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection transmission in human with latent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we have derived a mathematical model for within human dynamics of COVID-19 infection using delay differential equations. The new model considers a 'latent period' and 'the time for immune response' as delay parameters, allowing us to study the effects of time delays in human COVID-19 infection. We have determined the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability. The disease-free equilibrium is stable when the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is below unity. Stability switch of the endemic equilibrium occurs through Hopf-bifurcation. This study shows that the effect of latent delay is stabilizing whereas immune response delay has a destabilizing nature.</description>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, necessitating effective modelling approaches to understand and control its transmission dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit. Sensitivity analysis further provides valuable insights for designing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.</description>
