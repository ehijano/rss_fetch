      <title>$K$-isomeric states in the isotopic and isotonic chains of $^{178}$Hf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of $K^{\pi}=6^{+}$ and $8^{-}$ two-quasiparticle (q.p.) configurations in the isotopic and isotonic chains of even-even deformed nuclei around $^{178}$Hf and their ability to describe series of observed $K$-isomer excitations within the framework of a Skyrme Hartree--Fock--BCS (SHFBCS) approach using SIII interaction and seniority pairing strengths with self-consistent blocking. We apply the approach along the prescription in [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 105}, 044329 (2022)] used to describe $K$-isomers in the actinide and transfermium mass regions. The calculations allow us to identify the regions where proton or neutron configurations or their mixture may be responsible for the $K$-isomer formation. The obtained results provide a detailed test for the Skyrme SIII interaction used and outline the limits of applicability of the overall SHFBCS approach in the regions of well deformed nuclei. The study suggests that similar systematic analysis can be implemented in the heavier mass regions whenever enough data are available.</description>

      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS approach to $^{229m}$Th and neighboring nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of the $^{229m}$Th isomer and its possible manifestation also in neighboring nuclei is explored within a selfconsistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock plus Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach. By using the well established SIII Skyrme parametrization, without any special adjustments related to low-energy isomer, the single-particle spectrum provided by the model reproduces the correct isomer $K^{\pi}=3/2^{+}$ spin and parity, and the relative proximity of the isomeric state to the $K^{\pi}=5/2^{+}$ ground state, yet on the keV scale. We show that this approach may provide microscopic estimates for some related observables, such as the quadrupole and octupole moments, deformation parameters as well as magnetic dipole moments. Its ability to provide a prediction for the M1 isomer transition probability is discussed. The obtained $^{229}$Th single-particle structure is compared with that provided by calculations in neighbouring actinide isotopes and isotones, allowing us to assess the more general role of the considered mechanism for the formation of low-energy isomers.</description>

      <title>The $\rho$ meson magnetic dipole moment from BaBar $e^+e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-\pi^0 \pi^0 $ cross section measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14676v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the value of the magnetic dipole moment of the $\rho$ meson, using data from the BaBar Collaboration for the $e^{+} e^{-} \to \pi^+ \pi^- 2 \pi^0$ process. The considered center of mass energy range is from 0.9 to 1.8 GeV. We describe the $\gamma^* \to 4\pi$ vertex using a vector meson dominance model, including the intermediate resonant contributions relevant at these energies. We find $\mu_\rho = 2.7 \pm 0.3 $ in $e/2 m_\rho$ units. We improve on the previous extracted value, where preliminary data from the same collaboration was used, by considering definite data, better grounded values of the parameters involved and explicit gauge invariant description of the process.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Emissions from Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Implications for Nuclear Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07686v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observation of binary neutron-star mergers can provide valuable information on the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Here, we investigate to which extent electromagnetic observations of the associated kilonovae allow us to place constraints on the EoS. For this, we use state-of-the-art three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics simulations and detailed nucleosynthesis modeling to connect properties of observed light curves to properties of the accretion disk, and hence, the EoS. Using our general approach, we use multi-messenger observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo to study the impact of various sources of uncertainty on inferences of the EoS. We constrain the radius of a $\rm{1.4 M_\odot}$ neutron star to lie within $\rm{10.19\leq R_{1.4}\leq 13.0}$~km and the maximum mass to be $\rm{M_{TOV}\leq 3.06 M_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, a scenario encountered in a wide range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. It is ready to be applied to a broad class of scatterings and, in particular, should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the physics of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from lithium to iron. The method works even when the DNN is fine-tuned on a small dataset.</description>

      <title>Signature of hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by systematic numerical-relativity simulations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and only the crossover scenario makes it collapse into a black hole due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. These features pave the way for clarifying details of hadron-quark transition by compiling a wide variety of events observed with future gravitational-wave detectors. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Symmetry-Protected Signature of 3-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and characterizing multi-body interactions in quantum processes remains a significant challenge. This is partly because 2-body interactions can produce an arbitrary time evolution, a fundamental fact often called the universality of 2-local gates in the context of quantum computing. However, when an unknown Hamiltonian respects a U(1) symmetry such as charge or particle number conservation, N-body interactions exhibit a distinct symmetry-protected signature known as the N-body phase, which fewer-body interactions cannot mimic. We develop and demonstrate an efficient technique for the detection of 3-body interactions despite the presence of unknown 2-body interactions. This technique, which takes advantage of GHZ states for phase estimation, requires probing the unitary evolution and measuring its determinant in a small subspace that scales linearly with the system size, making it an efficient approach.</description>

      <title>A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with $\gamma-$jet in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium modification of jet substructure within the hot and dense nuclear matter has attracted enormous interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jet show the angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while the recent CMS results of the photon-tagged jets ($\gamma-$jet) indicate hints of broadening. In this work, we conduct a theoretical study on the angular structure of inclusive jet and $\gamma-$jet with a transport approach considering the jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We carry out the girth modification of $\gamma-$jet in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV, which shows a satisfactory agreement with the recent CMS measurement. We explore the connection between the selection bias and the jet kinematics when choosing different $x_{j\gamma}=p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$ threshold. Importantly, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma-$jet provides significant advantages to reduce the selection bias and can effectively collect jets sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions compared to the inclusive jet, which is critical to capture the jet angular broadening observed by CMS. We further estimate the contributions of the medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in inclusive reactions with unpolarized protons on unpolarized targets has been studied for almost 40 years. The NA61\SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS has a great potential to study transverse polarization in p-p and p-A collisions. In this work, we discuss the impact of magnetic field and limited detector acceptance on the possible polarization measurement by this experiment. Our analysis shows that the magnetic field impact on the $\Lambda$ polarization due to precession is one order of magnitude smaller than the detector acceptance-based polarization bias, and the identification of an experimental signal similar to that observed before by other experiments is possible.</description>

      <title>Structure in the speed of sound: from neutron stars to heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the observation of both heavy neutron stars and light ones with small radii, one anticipates a steep rise in the speed of sound of nuclear matter as a function of baryon density up to values close to the causal limit. A question follows whether such behavior of the speed of sound in neutron-rich matter is compatible with the equation of state extracted from low-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we consider a family of neutron star equations of state characterized by a steep rise in the speed of sound, and use the symmetry energy expansion to obtain equations of state applicable to the almost-symmetric nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. We then compare collective flow data from low-energy heavy-ion experiments with results of simulations obtained using the hadronic transport code SMASH with the mean-field potential reproducing the density-dependence of the speed of sound. We show that equations of state featuring a peak in the speed of sound squared occurring at densities between 2-3 times the saturation density of normal nuclear matter, producing neutron stars of nearly M_max~2.5 M_Sun, are consistent with heavy-ion collision data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One can improve predictability in the unknown domain by combining forecasts of imperfect complex computational models using a Bayesian statistical machine learning framework. In many cases, however, the models used in the mixing process are similar. In addition to contaminating the model space, the existence of such similar, or even redundant, models during the multimodeling process can result in misinterpretation of results and deterioration of predictive performance. In this work we describe a method based on the Principal Component Analysis that eliminates model redundancy. We show that by adding model orthogonalization to the proposed Bayesian Model Combination framework, one can arrive at better prediction accuracy and reach excellent uncertainty quantification performance.</description>

      <title>Use of quantality in nuclei and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quantality is discussed in the case of nuclei and other many-body systems such as atomic electrons. This dimensionless quantity is known to indicate when a many-body system behaves like a crystal or a quantum liquid. Its role is further analyzed, showing the emergence of a fundamental lengthscale, the limit radius, which corresponds to the hard-core of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the case of nucleons, and to a value close to the Bohr radius in the case of atomic electrons. The occurrence of a cluster phase in nuclei is analyzed using the quantality through its relation to the localization parameter, allowing for the identification of both the number of nucleons and the density as control parameters for the occurrence of this phase. The relation of the quantality to the magnitude of the interaction also exhibits a third dimensionless parameter, monitoring the magnitude of the spin-orbit effect in finite systems, through the realization of the pseudo-spin symmetry. The impact of quantality on the spin-orbit effect is compared in various many-body systems. The role of quantality in the relative effect of the binding energy and the shell one is also analyzed in nuclei. Finally, additional dimensionless quantities are proposed from the generalization of the quantality. Nuclei are found to be exceptional systems because all their dimensionless quantities are close to the order of unity, at variance with other many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for \(SU(N)\) Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

Abstract: We study low-energy nuclear physics at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into both processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies.</description>

      <title>Large $N_c$ QCD phase diagram at $\mu_B = 0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice studies suggest that at zero baryon chemical potential and increasing temperature there are three characteristic regimes in QCD that are connected by smooth analytical crossovers: a hadron gas regime at T &lt; T_ch ~ 155 MeV, an intermediate regime, called stringy fluid, at T_ch &lt; T &lt; ~ 3 T_ch, and a quark-gluon plasma regime at higher temperatures. These regimes have been interpreted to reflect different approximate symmetries and effective degrees of freedom. In the hadron gas the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons and the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD is spontaneously broken. The intermediate regime has been interpreted as lacking spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking along with the emergence of new approximate symmetry, chiral spin symmetry, that is not a symmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian, but is a symmetry of the confining part of the QCD Lagrangian. While the high temperature regime is the usual quark-gluon plasma which is often considered to reflect "deconfinement" in some way. This paper explores the behavior of these regimes of QCD as the number of colors in the theory, N_c, gets large. In the large N_c limit the theory is center-symmetric and notions of confinement and deconfinement are unambiguous. The energy density is O(N_c^0) in the meson gas, O(N_c^1) in the intermediate regime and O(N_c^2) in the quark-gluon plasma regime. In the large N_c limit these regimes may become distinct phases separated by first order phase transitions. The intermediate phase has the peculiar feature that glueballs should exist and have properties that are unchanged from what is seen in the vacuum (up to 1/N_c corrections), while the ordinary dilute gas of mesons with broken chiral symmetry disappears and approximate chiral spin symmetry should emerge.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Weakly Bound Light Nuclei in Central Collider Experiments: a Challenge in Favor of a Late Continuous Decoupling Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arguments are presented that the reaction products of central high energy nuclear collisions up to collider energies can rigorously be interpreted in terms of a continuous decoupling mechanism based on continuous equations of motion. The various aspects of the collision dynamics are investigate in terms of the individual decoupling processes. Thereby each observed particle decouples during its own temporal decoupling window. This includes a ``very late'' decoupling of the faintly bound Hypertritons observed in recent ALICE experiments. The success of the strategy is based upon 200 years old wisdom and leads to a revised interpretation of the entire decoupling process.</description>
