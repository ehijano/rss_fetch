      <title>On $\mathbb{A}$-generators of the cohomology $H^{*}(V^{\oplus 5})=\mathbb{Z}/2[u_1,\ldots,u_5]$ and the cohomological transfer of rank 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the cohomology of the 2-primary Steenrod algebra $\mathbb{A}$ is a central problem in algebraic topology, as it forms the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence converging to the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The Singer cohomological transfer, $\varphi_n$, is a key homomorphism for characterizing this cohomology. Singer conjectured that $\varphi_n$ is always a monomorphism. The Singer transfer is closely linked to the Peterson hit problem, which seeks a minimal generating set for the $\mathbb{A}$-module $H^{*}(V^{\oplus n}) = \mathbb{Z}/2[u_1, \ldots, u_n]$, also unsolved for $n \geq 5$. In this paper, we study the hit problem for $H^{*}(V^{\oplus 5})$ and verify Singer's conjecture for the case $n=5$ in the general degree $d = 2^{t+5} + 2^{t+2} + 2^{t+1}-5$ for any non-negative integer $t$. We demonstrate that the Singer cohomological transfer is an isomorphism for $n=5$ in degree $d$. This provides a positive answer to Singer's conjecture in these specific cases.</description>

      <title>Spectral sequences, Massey products and homology of covering spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the equivariant spectral sequence considered by Papadima-Suciu, and show that all its differentials are computed by higher order Massey products. As a first application, we extend to arbitrary field coefficients results of Pajitnov relating the size of Jordan blocks for the eigenvalue 1 part of the Alexander modules to the length of nonvanishing Massey products in cohomology. We also give computable upper bounds for the mod p Betti numbers of prime power cyclic covers, and resp. for the ranks of the cohomology groups with coefficients in a prime order rank one local system. Under suitable conditions, these bounds are improvements of the ones obtained by Papadima-Suciu. We also specialize these results to the case of hyperplane arrangement complements, showing, e.g., that vanishing of higher-order Massey products implies that the mod p Betti numbers of prime p tower cyclic covers are combinatorially determined.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Transfer Systems for Non-Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the notion of a $G$-transfer system provides homotopy theorists with a combinatorial way to study equivariant objects. In this paper, we focus on the properties of transfer systems for non-abelian groups. We explicitly describe the width of all dihedral groups, quaternion groups, and dicyclic groups. For a given $G$, the set of all $G$-transfer systems forms a poset lattice under inclusion; these are a useful resource to homotopical combinatorialists for detecting patterns and checking conjectures. We expand the suite of known transfer system lattices for non-abelian groups including those which are dihedral, dicyclic, Frobenius, and alternating.</description>

      <title>Simplicial covering dimension of extremal concept classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension theory is a branch of topology concerned with defining and analyzing dimensions of geometric and topological spaces in purely topological terms. In this work, we adapt the classical notion of topological dimension (Lebesgue covering) to binary concept classes. The topological space naturally associated with a concept class is its space of realizable distributions. The loss function and the class itself induce a simplicial structure on this space, with respect to which we define a simplicial covering dimension.
  We prove that for finite concept classes, this simplicial covering dimension exactly characterizes the list replicability number (equivalently, global stability) in PAC learning. This connection allows us to apply tools from classical dimension theory to compute the exact list replicability number of the broad family of extremal concept classes.</description>

      <title>Too Many or Too Few? Sampling Bounds for Topological Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological descriptors, such as the Euler characteristic function and the persistence diagram, have grown increasingly popular for representing complex data. Recent work showed that a carefully chosen set of these descriptors encodes all of the geometric and topological information about a shape in R^d. In practice, epsilon nets are often used to find samples in one of two extremes. On one hand, making strong geometric assumptions about the shape allows us to choose epsilon small enough (corresponding to a high enough density sample) in order to guarantee a faithful representation, resulting in oversampling. On the other hand, if we choose a larger epsilon in order to allow faster computations, this leads to an incomplete description of the shape and a discretized transform that lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we investigate how many directions are really needed to represent geometric simplicial complexes, exploring both synthetic and real-world datasets. We provide constructive proofs that help establish size bounds and an experimental investigation giving insights into the consequences of over- and undersampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over any field of characteristic $0$, we prove that the homotopy exact sequence of algebraic fundamental groups for the universal curve with unordered marked points does not split. The same nonsplitting holds for the universal hyperelliptic curve. Our approach extends Chen's topological result to the profinite setting and relies on the use of relative and continuous relative completions to detect the nonexistence of algebraic sections.</description>

Abstract: The closed neighborhood complex $\mathcal{N}[G]$ of a simple graph $G$ is the simplicial complex whose simplices are finite sets of vertices contained in a closed neighborhood of a vertex in $G$. We reveal that the closed neighborhood complex has the close connections with other concepts, including the independence complex of the canonical double covering and the independence complex of the neighborhood hypergraph. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental group of the closed neighborhood complex is isomorphic to Grigor'yan--Lin--Muranov--Yau's fundamental group of a graph introduced in the study of path homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiedorowicz suggested that it was likely that every finite simply connected CW complex is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup. We prove that every finite wedge of simply connected Moore spaces of finitely generated abelian groups is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup. Consequently, homology groups alone cannot preclude a finite simply connected CW complex from being homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup.</description>

Additionally, we implement a number of new features for the computation of unstable $\mathbb{A}^{1}$-Brouwer degrees and manipulation of classes in the unstable Grothendieck--Witt group.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

Abstract: We prove a refinement of Quillen's Theorem A, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a functor to be cofinal with respect to diagrams valued in a fixed $\infty$-category. We deduce this from a general duality phenomenon for weighted colimits, which is of independent interest. As a sample application, due to Betts and Dan-Cohen, we describe a simplified formula for the free $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebra on an $\mathbb{E}_0$-algebra in a stable rational $\infty$-category .</description>

      <title>Generalized Global Symmetries of $T[M]$ Theories: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the investigation of symmetries and anomalies of $T[M]$ theories obtained by compactifying 6d SCFTs on an internal manifold $M$. We extend the notion of "polarizations on a manifold $M$" to cases where $M$ may have boundaries or defects. Through examples with $M$ of dimension two, three, and four, we illustrate recurring themes in compactifications -- for instance, the important roles played by Kaluza-Klein modes, and how the generalized symmetries (including higher-group and non-invertible ones) of $T[M]$, together with their anomalies, arise from non-trivial combinations of the parent 6d symmetries and the geometric structures of the internal manifold. For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the "full moduli space" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the spectrum of line operators in $T[M_3]$, together with applications to the study of quantum invariants such as $\hat Z_a(M_3, q)$; and for 4-manifolds, predictions for VOA$[M_4]$ following from symmetries of $T[M_4]$, as well as the construction of a new invariant of 4-manifolds that depends on two "$q$-parameters." Along the way, we discuss a range of topics that are of independent interest, such as how non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions can become invertible under compactification, how to classify defects in quantum field theory via their response to a change of framing, and the interplay between $\hat Z_a$ and volume conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We describe a deformation of the $\infty$-category of Borel $G$-spectra for a finite group $G$. This provides a new presentation of the $a$-complete real Artin--Tate motivic stable homotopy category when $G=C_2$ and gives a new interpretation of the $a$-completed $C_2$-effective slice spectral sequence. As a new computational tool, we present a modified Adams--Novikov spectral sequence which computes the $RO(G)$-graded Mackey functor valued homotopy of Borel $G$-spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>Minimal Finite Model of Wedge Sum of Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify minimal finite models of the M\"{o}bius band and several wedge sums of spheres. In particular, we show that the minimal finite model of the M\"{o}bius band coincides with that of the circle $S^{1}$. Furthermore, we prove that both $S^{2}\vee S^{1}$ and $S^{2}\vee S^{2}$ admit minimal finite models on exactly seven points, and that each of $S^{1}\vee S^{1}\vee S^{2}$, $S^{1}\vee S^{1}\vee S^{1}\vee S^{2}$, $S^{1}\vee S^{2}\vee S^{2}$, $S^{2}\vee S^{2}\vee S^{2}$, and $S^{2}\vee S^{2}\vee S^{2}\vee S^{2}$ admits a minimal finite model on exactly eight points.</description>

      <title>A formula for the mod $p$ cohomology of $BPU(p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mod $p$ cohomology ring of the classifying space $BPU(p)$ of the projective unitary group $PU(p)$, when $p$ is an odd prime. We prove a mod $p$ formula analogous to a formula of Vistoli for the integral cohomology ring of $BPU(p)$. As an application, we give a simple topological proof of Vistoli's formula.</description>

      <title>$e$-invariants of quotients of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simply connected compact Lie group and $\mathscr{L}$ be the left invarinat framing of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ be the framing obtained by twisting $\mathscr{L}$ by a faithful representation $\lambda$. Given a torus subgroup $T''$ of $G$ we have a framing $(\mathcal{L}^\lambda)_{T''}$ of the quotient $G/T''$ induced from $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$. In this note we show that under a certain dimensional condition the $e_\mathbb{C}$-invariant of $G/T''$ with this framing provides a generator of the $J$-homomorphism or twice that. Thereby we also give a unified proof of the results for $SU(2n)$, $Spin(4n+1)$ and $Spin(8n-2)$ $(n\ge 1)$ previously proved.</description>

      <title>Trinitary algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\em $k$-trinitary algebra} is any subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ that is distinguished in this space by $k$ independent conditions of the form $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i) = f(\hat x_i)$, where $x_i, \tilde x_i,$ and $ \hat x_i $ are distinct points in $ M$, $i=1, \dots, k$, or is approximated by such subalgebras. Trinitary algebras naturally arise in the study of {\em discriminant varieties,} that is, the spaces of singular geometric objects, when the property of being singular is formulated in terms of the simultaneous behavior at three distinct points. The simplest singular objects of this kind are the plane curves with triple self-intersections, see \cite{A}, \cite{MD}.
  The spaces of all $k$-trinitary algebras in $C^\infty(M, {\mathbb R})$ are analogous to the spaces of all ideals of finite codimension, which play the same role in the study of discriminants defined in the terms of a single singular point. These spaces are also analogous to the spaces of {\em equilevel algebras} (see \cite{EA}), which arise in the study of discriminants defined by binary singularities.
  We classify the trinitary algebras up to the codimension four in $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$, compute the cohomology rings of their varieties and find the Stiefel--Whitney classes of their canonical normal bundles. We also present a series of $(2k-2)$-dimensional cohomology classes of the spaces of trinitary algebras of codimension $2k$ for any natural $k$.</description>

      <title>A Bilinear Form for Spin$^c$ Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented spin$^{c}$ manifold of dimension $(8n {+} 2)$ with fundamental class $[M]$, and let $\rho_{2} \colon H^{4n}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow H^{4n}(M; \mathbb{Z}/2)$ denote the $\bmod ~ 2$ reduction homomorphism. For any torsion class $t \in H^{4n}(M;\mathbb{Z})$, we establish the identity \[ \langle \rho_2(t) \cdot Sq^2 \rho_2 (t), [M] \rangle = \langle \rho_2 (t) \cdot Sq^2 v_{4n}(M), [M]\rangle, \] where $Sq^2$ is the Steenrod square, $v_{4n}(M)$ is the $4n$-th Wu class of $M$, $ x\cdot y$ denotes the cup product of $x$ and $y$, and $\langle \cdot ~, ~\cdot \rangle$ denotes the Kronecker product. This result generalizes the work of Landweber and Stong from spin to spin$^c$ manifolds.
  As an application, let $\beta^{\mathbb{Z}/2} \colon H^{4n+2}(M; \mathbb{Z}/2) \to H^{4n+3}(M; \mathbb{Z})$ be the Bockstein homomorphism associated to the short exact sequence of coefficients $\mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\times 2} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/2$. We deduce that $\beta^{\mathbb{Z}/2}(Sq^2 v_{4n}(M)) = 0$, and consequently, $Sq^3 v_{4n}(M) = 0$, for any closed oriented spin$^{c}$ manifold $M$ with $\dim M \le 8n{+}1$.</description>

      <title>Cloning systems and action operads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action operads and cloning systems are, respectively, the main ingredients in two approaches for axiomatically constructing Thompson-like groups due to Thumann and Witzel-Zaremsky. In this paper, we prove that action operads are equivalent to cloning systems that admit a certain extra structure, and which we call bilateral cloning systems. In addition, we describe their relation with crossed interval groups and product categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce notions of lax semiadditive and lax additive $(\infty,2)$-categories, categorifying the classical notions of semiadditive and additive 1-categories. To establish a well-behaved axiomatic framework, we develop a calculus of lax matrices and use it to prove that in locally cocomplete $(\infty,2)$-categories lax limits and lax colimits agree and are absolute. In the lax additive setting, we categorify fundamental constructions from homological algebra such as mapping complexes and mapping cones and establish their basic properties.</description>

      <title>A Homotopical Invariant of Weinstein Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One generally expects that the techniques of arboreal singularities and gluing of local differential graded categories will result in a useful global invariant for all Weinstein manifolds. In this paper we construct explicit models for the homotopy limits of diagrams of microlocal sheaf categories which arise from Weinstein surfaces with arboreal skeleta. This is done by characterizing all relevant Reedy model structures on the categories of diagrams that we care about. We prove invariance using a complete set of moves for Weinstein homotopies in this setting. Finally we give combinatorial presentations of the invariant for all topological surfaces.</description>

      <title>Notes on the cohomology of partial Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hessenberg varieties are a family of subvarieties of full flag varieties. This family contains well-known varieties such as Springer fibers, Peterson varieties, and permutohedral varieties. It was introduced by De Mari-Procesi-Shayman in 1992 and has been actively studied in this decade. In particular, unexpected relations to hyperplane arrangements and the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in graph theory have been discovered. Hessenberg varieties can be defined in partial flag varieties. In this paper, we study their cohomology by relating them to the cohomology of Hessenberg varieties in the full flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. We show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection \( \nabla^C \) is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class, minus the dimension of the space of harmonic parallel tensors \( P^{2}(M_{1})\otimes P^{1}(M_{2}) + P^{1}(M_{1})\otimes P^{2}(M_{2}) \). The bound depends only on the mixed class \( [\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}} \in H^{3}(M;\mathbb{R}) \) and on the spaces of \( g_{1} \)-parallel harmonic \( 2 \)-forms and \( g_{2} \)-parallel harmonic \( 1 \)-forms (and vice-versa); it is therefore independent of any deformation of \( g_{1} \) or \( g_{2} \) that preserves these parallel form subspaces, hence it is metric-invariant modulo parallel-form preserving deformations. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of \( \mathfrak{hol}_{p}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C}) \).</description>
