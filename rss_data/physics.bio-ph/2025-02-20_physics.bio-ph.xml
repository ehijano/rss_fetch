      <title>A general approach to the statistics of microbial orientation: L\'{e}vy walks, noise, and deterministic motion</title>

Abstract: Microbial motion is typically analyzed by simplified models in which trajectories exhibit straight runs (perhaps with added Gaussian noise) followed by random, discrete tumbling events. We present the results of a statistical analysis of the angular dynamics for four different swimming microbes: tumbling and smooth-swimming strains of \textit{Bacillus subtilis} and two Eukaryotic algae, \textit{Tetraselmis suecica} and \textit{Euglena gracilis}. We show that the angular statistics closely resemble a Voigt profile, the convolution of a Gaussian (L\'{e}vy index $\alpha=2$) and Lorentzian (L\'{e}vy index $\alpha=1$) distribution. This distribution is ubiquitous for all four microbes. Rather than modeling tumbling as a discrete process, we model tumbling dynamics as a continuous process: L\'{e}vy flights in the orientational dynamics using a Lorentzian noise model. This model is analytically solvable. Each individual microbe trajectory has both stochastic behavior (noise) and varying deterministic behavior, such as helices of different sizes and frequencies and circular arcs with different radii. We model the distribution of different deterministic behavior via an ensemble theory. The deterministic behavior (e.g., circular arcs) comes from physical observations of the swimming behavior and explains many of the qualitative features in the data that cannot be explained by a pure noise model. From this theory, we estimate the strength of Lorentzian noise, the physical rotational diffusion constant, and some relevant parameters relating to the distributions of deterministic behavior. This analysis shows that in some cases Gaussian noise is not the dominant process responsible for the angular statistics following a Voigt profile.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the cumulant series in neuroimaging</title>

Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMRI, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent "fingerprint". Here we reveal the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMRI signal, classify all 21 invariants of diffusion and covariance tensors in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Previously studied dMRI contrasts are expressed via 7 invariants, while the remaining 14 provide novel complementary information. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine 3-4 most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMRI signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinical practice.</description>
