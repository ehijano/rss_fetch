      <title>Metamizer: a versatile neural optimizer for fast and accurate physics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient physics simulations are essential for numerous applications, ranging from realistic cloth animations or smoke effects in video games, to analyzing pollutant dispersion in environmental sciences, to calculating vehicle drag coefficients in engineering applications. Unfortunately, analytical solutions to the underlying physical equations are rarely available, and numerical solutions require high computational resources. Latest developments in the field of physics-based Deep Learning have led to promising efficiency improvements but still suffer from limited generalization capabilities and low accuracy compared to numerical solvers.
  In this work, we introduce Metamizer, a novel neural optimizer that iteratively solves a wide range of physical systems with high accuracy by minimizing a physics-based loss function. To this end, our approach leverages a scale-invariant architecture that enhances gradient descent updates to accelerate convergence. Since the neural network itself acts as an optimizer, training this neural optimizer falls into the category of meta-optimization approaches.
  We demonstrate that Metamizer achieves unprecedented accuracy for deep learning based approaches - sometimes approaching machine precision - across multiple PDEs after training on the Laplace, advection-diffusion and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation as well as on cloth simulations. Remarkably, the model also generalizes to PDEs that were not covered during training such as the Poisson, wave and Burgers equation.
  Our results suggest that Metamizer could have a profound impact on future numerical solvers, paving the way for fast and accurate neural physics simulations without the need for retraining.</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Tensor Train Multiplication (TTM) algorithm for the elementwise multiplication of two tensor trains with bond dimension $\chi$. The computational complexity and memory requirements of the TTM algorithm scale as $\chi^3$ and $\chi^2$, respectively. This represents a significant improvement compared with the conventional approach, where the computational complexity scales as $\chi^4$ and memory requirements scale as $\chi^3$.We benchmark the TTM algorithm using flows obtained from artificial turbulence generation and numerically demonstrate its improved runtime and memory scaling compared with the conventional approach. The TTM algorithm paves the way towards GPU accelerated tensor network simulations of computational fluid dynamics problems with large bond dimensions due to its dramatic improvement in memory scaling.</description>

      <title>Causality-Respecting Adaptive Refinement for PINNs: Enabling Precise Interface Evolution in Phase Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their accuracy in dynamical systems, particularly those involving sharp moving boundaries with complex initial morphologies, remains a challenge. This study introduces an approach combining residual-based adaptive refinement (RBAR) with causality-informed training to enhance the performance of PINNs in solving spatio-temporal PDEs. Our method employs a three-step iterative process: initial causality-based training, RBAR-guided domain refinement, and subsequent causality training on the refined mesh. Applied to the Allen-Cahn equation, a widely-used model in phase field simulations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in solution accuracy and computational efficiency over traditional PINNs. Notably, we observe an 'overshoot and relocate' phenomenon in dynamic cases with complex morphologies, showcasing the method's adaptive error correction capabilities. This synergistic interaction between RBAR and causality training enables accurate capture of interface evolution, even in challenging scenarios where traditional PINNs fail. Our framework not only resolves the limitations of uniform refinement strategies but also provides a generalizable methodology for solving a broad range of spatio-temporal PDEs. The simplicity and effectiveness of our RBAR-causality combined PINN offer promising potential for applications across various physical systems characterized by complex, evolving interfaces.</description>

      <title>Air Quality Prediction with Physics-Informed Dual Neural ODEs in Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution significantly threatens human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective air quality prediction to inform public policy. Traditional approaches are generally categorized into physics-based and data-driven models. Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-informed approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-informed approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way. These dual representations are temporally aligned and fused to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that Air-DualODE achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting pollutant concentrations across various spatial scales, thereby offering a promising solution for real-world air quality challenges.</description>

      <title>Engineering optical forces through Maxwell stress tensor inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise spatial manipulation of particles via optical forces is essential in many research areas, ranging from biophysics to atomic physics. Central to this effort is the challenge of designing optical systems that are optimized for specific applications. Traditional design methods often rely on trial-and-error methods, or on models that approximate the particle as a point dipole, which only works for particles much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. In this work, we present a general inverse design framework based on the Maxwell stress tensor formalism capable of simultaneously designing all components of the system, while being applicable to particles of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Notably, we show that with small modifications to the baseline formulation, it is possible to engineer systems capable of attracting, repelling, accelerating, oscillating, and trapping particles. We demonstrate our method using various case studies where we simultaneously design the particle and its environment, with particular focus on free-space particles and particle-metalens systems.</description>

      <title>A conditional formulation of the Vlasov-Ampere Equations: A conservative, positivity, asymptotic, and Gauss law preserving scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel reformulation of the Vlasov-Amp{\`e}re equations for plasmas. This reformulation exposes discrete symmetries to achieve simultaneous conservation of mass, momentum, and energy; preservation of Gauss's law involution; positivity of the distribution function; and quasi-neutral asymptotics. Our approach relies on transforming variables and coordinates, leading to a coupled system of a modified Vlasov equation and the associated moment-field equations. The modified Vlasov equation evolves a conditional distribution function that excludes information on mass, momentum, and energy densities. The mass, momentum, and energy density, in turn, are evolved using moment equations, in which discrete symmetries, conservation laws, and involution constraints are enforced. The reformulation is compatible with a recent slow-manifold reduction technique, which separates the fast electron time scales and simplifies handling the asymptotic quasi-neutrality limit within the easier to solve moment-field subsystem. Using this new formulation, we develop a numerical approach for the reduced 1D1V subsystem that, for the first time, simultaneously satisfies the important physical constraints while preserving the quasi-neutrality asymptotic limit. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated through canonical electrostatic test problems, including the multiscale ion acoustic shock wave problem.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uncertainty estimations for Gaussian process regression based machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have seen significant advances as efficient replacement of expensive quantum chemical calculations. Uncertainty estimations for MLIPs are crucial to quantify the additional model error they introduce and to leverage this information in active learning strategies. MLIPs that are based on Gaussian process regression provide a standard deviation as a possible uncertainty measure. An alternative approach are ensemble-based uncertainties. Although these uncertainty measures have been applied to active learning, it has rarely been studied how they correlate with the error, and it is not always clear whether active learning actually outperforms random sampling strategies. We consider GPR models with Coulomb and SOAP representations as inputs to predict potential energy surfaces and excitation energies of molecules. We evaluate, how the GPR variance and ensemble-based uncertainties relate to the error and whether model performance improves by selecting the most uncertain samples from a fixed configuration space. For the ensemble based uncertainty estimations, we find that they often do not provide any information about the error. For the GPR standard deviation, we find that often predictions with an increasing standard deviation also have an increasing systematical bias, which is not captured by the uncertainty. In these cases, selecting training samples with the highest uncertainty leads to a model with a worse test error compared to random sampling. We conclude that confidence intervals, which are derived from the predictive standard deviation, can be highly overconfident. Selecting samples with high GPR standard deviation leads to a model that overemphasizes the borders of the configuration space represented in the fixed dataset. This may result in worse performance in more densely sampled areas but better generalization for extrapolation tasks.</description>

      <title>Modifications of SPH towards three-dimensional simulations of an icy moon with internal ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are some traces of the existence of internal ocean in some icy moons, such as the vapor plumes of Europa and Enceladus. This implies a region of liquid water beneath the surface ice shell. Since liquid water would be essential for the origin of life, it is important to understand the development of these internal oceans, particularly their temperature distribution and evolution. The balance between tidal heating and radiative cooling is believed to sustain liquid water beneath an icy moon's surface. We aim to simulate the tidal heating of an internal ocean in an icy moon using 3-dimensional numerical fluid calculations with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We incorporated viscosity and thermal conduction terms into the governing equations of SPH. However, we encountered two issues while calculating rigid body rotation using SPH with a viscous term: (1) conventional viscosity formulations generated unphysical forces that hindered rotation, and (2) there was artificial internal energy partitioning within the layered structure, which was due to the standard SPH formulations. To address the first issue, we modified the viscosity formulation.For the second, we adopted Density Independent SPH (DISPH) developed in previous studies to improve behavior at discontinuous surfaces. Additionally, we implemented radiative cooling using an algorithm to define fluid surfaces via the particle method. We also introduced an equation of state accounting for phase transitions. With these modifications, we have refined the SPH method to encompass all necessary physical processes for simulating the evolution of icy moons with internal oceans.</description>

      <title>Revealing Molecular Mechanism of Nonmonotonic Relationship between Antifreeze Activity and Chain Length in Polyprolines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) &gt; DP=15 (P15) &gt; DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.</description>

      <title>Design of novel organic proton-transfer acid-base (anti-)ferroelectric salts with crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic molecular ferroelectrics, including organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics, are potentially attractive in organic electronics and have significant chemical tunability. Among these, acid-base proton transfer (PT) salts stand out due to their low coercive fields and the possibility to tune their properties with different acid-base combinations. Using crystal structure prediction, combining small acid and base organic molecular species, we here predict three novel acid-base PT ferroelectric salts with higher polarization than existing materials. We also report two combinations that form antiferroelectric crystal structures. However, some combinations also result in unfavorable packing or the formation of co-crystal or in one case a divalent salt. The protonation state is found to be highly linked to the crystal structure, with cases where salt crystal structures have the same energetic preferability as co-crystals with a different crystalline packing.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce CODES, a benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of surrogate architectures for coupled ODE systems. Besides standard metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and inference time, CODES provides insights into surrogate behaviour across multiple dimensions like interpolation, extrapolation, sparse data, uncertainty quantification and gradient correlation. The benchmark emphasizes usability through features such as integrated parallel training, a web-based configuration generator, and pre-implemented baseline models and datasets. Extensive documentation ensures sustainability and provides the foundation for collaborative improvement. By offering a fair and multi-faceted comparison, CODES helps researchers select the most suitable surrogate for their specific dataset and application while deepening our understanding of surrogate learning behaviour.</description>

      <title>Origin of Oxygen Partial Pressure-Dependent Conductivity in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SrTiO3 (STO) displays a broad spectrum of physical properties, including superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and photoconductivity, making it a standout semiconductor material. Despite extensive researches, the oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity in STO has re-mained elusive. This study leverages first-principles calculations, and systematically investigates the intrinsic defect properties of STO. The results reveal that VO, VSr, and TiSr are the dominant intrinsic defects, influencing STO's conductivity under varying O chemical potentials (oxygen partial pressures). Under O-poor condition, VO is the predominant donor, while VSr is the main acceptor. As the oxygen pressure increases, TiSr emerges as a critical donor defect under O-rich condition, significantly affecting conductivity. Additionally, the study elucidates the abnormal phenomenon where VTi, typically an acceptor, exhibits donor-like behavior due to the formation of O-trimer. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of how intrinsic defects tune the Fermi level, thereby altering STO's conductivity from n-type to p-type across different O chemical potentials. These insights resolve the long-standing issue of oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity and explain the observed metallic conductivity in oxygen-deficient STO.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework based on neural network that reformulates classical mechanics as an operator learning problem. A machine directly maps a potential function to its corresponding trajectory in phase space without solving the Hamilton equations. Most notably, while conventional methods tend to accumulate errors over time through iterative time integration, our approach prevents error propagation. Two newly developed neural network architectures, namely VaRONet and MambONet, are introduced to adapt the Variational LSTM sequence-to-sequence model and leverage the Mamba model for efficient temporal dynamics processing. We tested our approach with various 1D physics problems: harmonic oscillation, double-well potentials, Morse potential, and other potential models outside the training data. Compared to traditional numerical methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm, our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

      <title>Physics-informed Partitioned Coupled Neural Operator for Complex Networks</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Operators provide efficient, high-fidelity simulations for systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, most existing studies focus only on multi-scale, multi-physics systems within a single spatial region, neglecting the case with multiple interconnected sub-regions, such as gas and thermal systems. To address this, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Partitioned Coupled Neural Operator (PCNO) to enhance the simulation performance of such networks. Compared to the existing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), this method designs a joint convolution operator within the Fourier layer, enabling global integration capturing all sub-regions. Additionally, grid alignment layers are introduced outside the Fourier layer to help the joint convolution operator accurately learn the coupling relationship between sub-regions in the frequency domain. Experiments on gas networks demonstrate that the proposed operator not only accurately simulates complex systems but also shows good generalization and low model complexity.</description>

      <title>PARPHOM: PARallel PHOnon calculator for Moir\'e systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of a twist between two layers of two-dimensional materials has opened up a new and exciting field of research known as twistronics. In these systems, the phonon dispersions show significant renormalization and enhanced electron-phonon interactions as a function of the twist angle. However, the large system size of the resulting moir\'e patterns in these systems makes phonon calculations computationally challenging. In this paper, we present PARPHOM, a powerful code package designed to address these challenges. PARPHOM enables the generation of force constants, computation of phononic band structures, and determination of density of states in twisted 2D material systems. Moreover, PARPHOM provides essential routines to investigate the finite temperature dynamics in these systems and analyze the chirality of the phonon bands. This paper serves as an introduction to PARPHOM, highlighting its capabilities and demonstrating its utility in unraveling the intricate phononic properties of twisted 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient time dependent Wannier functions for ultrafast dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent Wannier functions were initially proposed as a means for calculating the polarization current in crystals driven by external fields. In this work, we present a simple gauge where Wannier states are defined based on the maximally localized functions at the initial time, and are propagated using the time-dependent Bloch states obtained from established first-principles calculations, avoiding the costly Wannierization at ech time step. We show that this basis efficiently describes the time-dependent polarization of the laser driven system through the analysis of the motion of Wannier centers. We use this technique to analyze highly nonlinear and non-perturbative responses such as high harmonic generation in solids, using the hexagonal boron nitride as an illustrative example, and we show how it provides an intuitive picture for the physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points at each step are constructed based on the data drawn from the above two steps using the tensor product. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domains, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINNs for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINNs and one of the state-of-the-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINNs for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference (FD) method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWEs) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation by parts (SBP) FD operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions (BCs) for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear vector invariant SWE in the subcritical regime, where energy is an entropy functional, we find that energy/entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing SBP framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove both nonlinear and local linear stability results, as well as a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWEs. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Density Scaling: Coarse-Graining in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of liquids is pivotal for the study of larger spatiotemporal processes, especially in glass-forming materials at low temperatures. Density scaling, observed in many molecular systems through experiments, offers an efficient means for exploring a vast range of time scales along a one-dimensional phase diagram. However, the theoretical foundation provided by isomorph theory is of limited use for molecular systems, since currently no first-principles theory exists that can explain the origins of density scaling or make predictions based on it. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework employing coarse-graining in space and time. Spatial coarse-graining reduces a molecule to a center-of-mass-level description by eliminating fast degrees of freedom, while temporal coarse-graining involves averaging fluctuations or correlation functions over characteristic time scales. We show that both approaches enable ab initio estimation of the density scaling coefficient for ortho-terphenyl, consistent with experimental values. Building on these findings, we employ excess entropy scaling to derive a microscopic theory that underpins density scaling from fully atomistic simulations. Our results illuminate the role of coarse-graining in assessing slow fluctuations in molecules and unravel the microscopic nature of density scaling. Ultimately, our proposed framework enables systematic bottom-up approaches for predicting transport coefficients that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible and computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations can enable sensing beyond the classical limits of precision, with the realization of such sensors poised for transformative impacts across science and engineering. Real devices, however, face the accumulated impacts of noise effects, architecture constraints, and finite sampling rates, making the design and success of practical quantum sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks that support the optimization and analysis of imperfections from one end of a sensing protocol through to the other (i.e., from probe state preparation through to parameter estimation) are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation, respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ans\"atze for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the impacts that noisy state preparation/measurement and finite data sampling have on parameter estimation. End-to-end variational frameworks can thus underpin powerful design and analysis tools for realizing quantum advantage in practical, robust sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating force constants for crystal structures is crucial for calculating various phonon-related properties. However, this task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with a large number of atoms or when third- and higher-order force constants are required. In this study, we propose an efficient approach that involves constructing a complete orthonormal basis set for the force constants. We formulate this approach using projection matrices and their eigenvectors to meet the requirements for the force constants. This basis set enables precise inference of the force constants from displacement-force datasets. Our efficient algorithms for basis-set construction and force constant estimation are implemented in the symfc code. Furthermore, several applications demonstrated in this study indicate that the current approach facilitates the efficient and accurate determination of force constants.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to electron ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the electronic damage to protein crystals in SFX by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms ($Z &gt; 10$) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by inducing electron ionization processes that are highly damaging on the XFEL pulse timescale. Native sulfur atoms have a considerable effect on damage-induced noise. Likewise, proteins suffer less damage when the crystal solvent contains lower concentrations of heavy elements. The proximity of the X-ray energy to a heavy-element absorption edge has a strong and non-trivial influence on the damage induced in these models. In one representative protein (lysozyme substituted with selenomethionine), adjusting the X-ray energy from 14 keV to 12 keV is as effective at reducing the ionization of light atoms as compressing the pulse width from 50 fs to 5 fs. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in the XFEL regime.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J. Math. Phys. 11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector, the nonlinear electric dipole moment per unit volume, is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then simulation results are presented for the simplified 2D transverse magnetic case, revisiting the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector. The simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with isotropic polarization vector simulation results.</description>
