      <title>Optimized Non-Primary Channel Access Design in IEEE 802.11bn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IEEE 802.11 standards, culminating in IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), have significantly expanded bandwidth capacities from 20 MHz to 320 MHz, marking a crucial evolution in wireless access technology. Despite these advancements, the full potential of these capacities remains largely untapped due to inefficiencies in channel management, in particular, the underutilization of secondary (non-primary) channels when the primary channel is occupied. This paper delves into the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) protocol, initially proposed by the IEEE 802.11 Ultra-High Reliability (UHR) group, aimed at addressing these inefficiencies. Our research not only proposes an analytical model to assess the throughput of NPCA in terms of average throughput but also crucially identifies that the overhead associated with the NPCA protocol is significant and cannot be ignored. This overhead often undermines the effectiveness of the NPCA, challenging the assumption that it is invariably superior to traditional models. Based on these findings, we have developed and simulated a new hybrid model that dynamically integrates the strengths of both legacy and NPCA models. This model overall outperforms the existing models under all channel occupancy conditions, offering a robust solution to enhance throughput efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robot-As-A-Sensor: Forming a Sensing Network with Robots for Underground Mining Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, robots are deployed as mobile platforms equipped with sensing, communication and computing capabilities, especially in the mining industry, where they perform tasks in hazardous and repetitive environments. Despite their potential, individual robots face significant limitations when completing complex tasks that require the collaboration of multiple robots. This collaboration requires a robust wireless network to ensure operational efficiency and reliability. This paper introduces the concept of "Robot-As-A-Sensor" (RAAS), which treats the robots as mobile sensors within structures similar to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We later identify specific challenges in integrating RAAS technology and propose technological advancements to address these challenges. Finally, we provide an outlook about the technologies that can contribute to realising RAAS, suggesting that this approach could catalyse a shift towards safer, more intelligent, and sustainable industry practices. We believe that this innovative RAAS framework could significantly transform industries requiring advanced technological integration.</description>

      <title>Cell Switching in HAPS-Aided Networking: How the Obscurity of Traffic Loads Affects the Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to introduce the cell load estimation problem of cell switching approaches in cellular networks specially-presented in a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-assisted network. The problem arises from the fact that the traffic loads of sleeping base stations for the next time slot cannot be perfectly known, but they can rather be estimated, and any estimation error could result in divergence from the optimal decision, which subsequently affects the performance of energy efficiency. The traffic loads of the sleeping base stations for the next time slot are required because the switching decisions are made proactively in the current time slot. Two different Q-learning algorithms are developed; one is full-scale, focusing solely on the performance, while the other one is lightweight and addresses the computational cost. Results confirm that the estimation error is capable of changing cell switching decisions that yields performance divergence compared to no-error scenarios. Moreover, the developed Q-learning algorithms perform well since an insignificant difference (i.e., 0.3%) is observed between them and the optimum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cross-Cluster Networking to Support Extended Reality Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extented Reality (XR) refers to a class of contemporary services that are intertwined with a plethora of rather demanding Quality of Service (QoS) and functional requirements. Despite Kubernetes being the de-facto standard in terms of deploying and managing contemporary containerized microservices, it lacks adequate support for cross-cluster networking, hindering service-to-service communication across diverse cloud domains. Although there are tools that may be leveraged alongside Kubernetes in order to establish multi-cluster deployments, each one of them comes with its drawbacks and limitations. The purpose of this article is to explore the various potential technologies that may facilitate multi-cluster deployments and to propose how they may be leveraged to provide a cross-cluster connectivity solution that caters to the intricacies of XR services. The proposed solution is based on the use of two open source frameworks, namely Cluster API for multi-cluster management, and Liqo for multi-cluster interconnectivity. The efficiency of this approach is evaluated in the context of two experiments. This work is the first attempt at proposing a solution for supporting multi-cluster deployments in a manner that is aligned with the requirements of XR services</description>

      <title>Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. We can recommend a subset of the contents to the users which encourages the users to request these contents. Recommendation can thus be used to increase cache hits. We formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend. We provide an upper bound on the regret of our algorithm. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Mobile Network Performance Prediction Using Network &amp; Remote Sensing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of Network Performance is crucial for several tasks in telecom networks. Telecom networks regularly serve a vast number of radio nodes. Each radio node provides services to end-users in the associated coverage areas. The task of predicting Network Performance for telecom networks necessitates considering complex spatio-temporal interactions and incorporating geospatial information where the radio nodes are deployed. Instead of relying on historical data alone, our approach augments network historical performance datasets with satellite imagery data. Our comprehensive experiments, using real-world data collected from multiple different regions of an operational network, show that the model is robust and can generalize across different scenarios. The results indicate that the model, utilizing satellite imagery, performs very well across the tested regions. Additionally, the model demonstrates a robust approach to the cold-start problem, offering a promising alternative for initial performance estimation in newly deployed sites.</description>

      <title>Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, QNs can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs (EPs) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states, and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator (NetSquid), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>FMLFS: A federated multi-label feature selection based on information theory in IoT environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In certain emerging applications such as health monitoring wearable and traffic monitoring systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate or collect a huge amount of multi-label datasets. Within these datasets, each instance is linked to a set of labels. The presence of noisy, redundant, or irrelevant features in these datasets, along with the curse of dimensionality, poses challenges for multi-label classifiers. Feature selection (FS) proves to be an effective strategy in enhancing classifier performance and addressing these challenges. Yet, there is currently no existing distributed multi-label FS method documented in the literature that is suitable for distributed multi-label datasets within IoT environments. This paper introduces FMLFS, the first federated multi-label feature selection method. Here, mutual information between features and labels serves as the relevancy metric, while the correlation distance between features, derived from mutual information and joint entropy, is utilized as the redundancy measure. Following aggregation of these metrics on the edge server and employing Pareto-based bi-objective and crowding distance strategies, the sorted features are subsequently sent back to the IoT devices. The proposed method is evaluated through two scenarios: 1) transmitting reduced-size datasets to the edge server for centralized classifier usage, and 2) employing federated learning with reduced-size datasets. Evaluation across three metrics - performance, time complexity, and communication cost - demonstrates that FMLFS outperforms five other comparable methods in the literature and provides a good trade-off on three real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Profitability in Timely Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a communication system where a group of users, interconnected in a bidirectional gossip network, wishes to follow a time-varying source, e.g., updates on an event, in real-time. The users wish to maintain their expected version ages below a threshold, and can either rely on gossip from their neighbors or directly subscribe to a server publishing about the event, if the former option does not meet the timeliness requirements. The server wishes to maximize its profit by increasing subscriptions from users and minimizing event sampling frequency to reduce costs. This leads to a Stackelberg game between the server and the users where the sender is the leader deciding its sampling frequency and the users are the followers deciding their subscription strategies. We investigate equilibrium strategies for low-connectivity and high-connectivity topologies.</description>

      <title>EcoPull: Sustainable IoT Image Retrieval Empowered by TinyML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces EcoPull, a sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) framework empowered by tiny machine learning (TinyML) models for fetching images from wireless visual sensor networks. Two types of learnable TinyML models are installed in the IoT devices: i) a behavior model and ii) an image compressor model. The first filters out irrelevant images for the current task, reducing unnecessary transmission and resource competition among the devices. The second allows IoT devices to communicate with the receiver via latent representations of images, reducing communication bandwidth usage. However, integrating learnable modules into IoT devices comes at the cost of increased energy consumption due to inference. The numerical results show that the proposed framework can save &gt; 70% energy compared to the baseline while maintaining the quality of the retrieved images at the ES.</description>

      <title>Age-minimal Multicast by Graph Attention Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) is an emerging metric used to assess the timeliness of information, gaining research interest in real-time multicast applications such as video streaming and metaverse platforms. In this paper, we consider a dynamic multicast network with energy constraints, where our objective is to minimize the expected time-average AoI through energy-constrained multicast routing and scheduling. The inherent complexity of the problem, given the NP-hardness and intertwined scheduling and routing decisions, makes existing approaches inapplicable. To address these challenges, we decompose the original problem into two subtasks, each amenable to reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Subsequently, we propose an innovative framework based on graph attention networks (GATs) to effectively capture graph information with superior generalization capabilities. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments on three datasets including a real-world dataset called AS-733, and show that our proposed scheme reduces the average weighted AoI by 62.9% and reduces the energy consumption by at most 72.5% compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Social Networking: Where People have Agency over their Personal Information and Social Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13941v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offering an architecture for social networking in which people have agency over their personal information and social graph is an open challenge. Here we present a grassroots architecture for serverless, permissionless, peer-to-peer social networks termed Grassroots Social Networking that aims to address this challenge. The architecture is geared for people with networked smartphones -- roaming (address-changing) computing devices communicating over an unreliable network (e.g., using UDP). The architecture incorporates (i) a decentralized social graph, where each person controls, maintains and stores only their local neighborhood in the graph; (iii) personal feeds, with authors and followers who create and store the feeds; and (ii) a grassroots dissemination protocol, in which communication among people occurs only along the edges of their social graph. The architecture realizes these components using the blocklace data structure -- a partially-ordered conflict-free counterpart of the totally-ordered conflict-based blockchain. We provide two example Grassroots Social Networking protocols -- Twitter-like and WhatsApp-like -- and address their security (safety, liveness and privacy), spam/bot/deep-fake resistance, and implementation, demonstrating how server-based social networks could be supplanted by a grassroots architecture.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Component Analysis Towards Effective VNF Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing concerns of knowledge transfer and data privacy challenge the traditional gather-and-analyse paradigm in networks. Specifically, the intelligent orchestration of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) requires understanding and profiling the resource consumption. However, profiling all kinds of VNFs is time-consuming. It is important to consider transferring the well-profiled VNF knowledge to other lack-profiled VNF types while keeping data private. To this end, this paper proposes a Federated Transfer Component Analysis (FTCA) method between the source and target VNFs. FTCA first trains Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on the source VNF profiling data, and the trained GANs model is sent to the target VNF domain. Then, FTCA realizes federated domain adaptation by using the generated source VNF data and less target VNF profiling data, while keeping the raw data locally. Experiments show that the proposed FTCA can effectively predict the required resources for the target VNF. Specifically, the RMSE index of the regression model decreases by 38.5% and the R-squared metric advances up to 68.6%.</description>
