      <title>Tutorial on running median subtraction filter with application to searches for exotic field transients in multi-messenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running Median Subtraction Filter (RMSF) is a robust statistical tool for removing slowly varying baselines in data streams containing transients (short-duration signals) of interest. In this work, we explore the RMSF performance and properties using simulated time series and analytical methods. We study the RMSF fidelity in preserving the signal of interest in the data using (i) a Gaussian pulse and (ii) a transient oscillatory signal. Such signals may be generated by hypothetical exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) associated with intense astrophysical events like binary black hole or neutron star mergers. We consider and assess RMSF as a candidate method to extract transient ELF signals. RMSF operates by sliding a window across the data and subtracting the median value within each window from the data points. With a suitable choice of running window size, RMSF effectively filters out baseline variations without compromising the integrity of transients. The RMSF window width is a critical parameter: it must be wide enough to encompass a short transient but narrow enough to remove the slowly varying baseline. We show that the RMSF removes the mean of a normally distributed white noise while preserving its variance and higher order moments in the limit of large windows. In addition, RMSF does not color the white noise stream, i.e., it does not induce any significant correlation in the filtered data. Ideally, a filter would preserve both the signal of interest and the statistical characteristics of the stochastic component of the data, while removing the background clutter and outliers. We find the RMSF to satisfy these practical criteria for data pre-processing. While we rigorously prove several RMSF properties, the paper is organized as a tutorial with multiple illustrations of RMSF applications.</description>

      <title>An accurate equation for the gravitational bending of light by a static massive object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression for the bending angle of light due to a non-rotating massive object, considering the actual distances from source and observer to the gravitational mass, is derived. Our novel formula generalizes Darwin well-known equation for gravitational light bending [Proc. R. Soc. London A 263, 39-50 (1961)], where both source and observer are placed at infinite distance from the lensing mass, and provides excellent results in comparison with the post Newtonian (PPN) formalism up to first order. As a result, the discrepancy between our recent expression and the PPN approach is 6.6 mas for sun-grazing beams coming from planet Mercury, with significant differences up to 2 mas for distant starlight. Our findings suggest that these considerations should not be dismissed for both solar system objects and extragalactic sources, where non-negligible errors might be present in ultraprecise astrometry calculations.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain And MultiMessenger Astrophysics Communications Science Analysis Group Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Time-Domain And MultiMessenger (TDAMM) Communications Science Analysis Group (TDAMMCommSAG) was formulated to describe the unique technical challenges of communicating rapidly to and from NASA astrophysics missions studying the most variable, transient, and extreme objects in the Universe. This report describes the study of if and how the transition from current NASA-operated space and ground relays to commercial services will adequately serve these missions. Depending on the individual mission requirements and Concept of Operations (ConOps), TDAMM missions may utilize a rapid low-rate demand access service, a low-rate continuous contact service, low-latency downlink upon demand, or a higher-latency but regular relay service. The specific implementations can vary via space relay or direct to Earth, but requires flexibility and adaptability using modern software infrastructure. The study team reviewed the current state of NASA communications services and future commercial and NASA communications services under study and in development. We explored the communications capabilities driving from the behavior of the astrophysical objects themselves.</description>

      <title>Energy calibration of GTM on ground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-ray Transients Monitor (GTM) on board the Formosat-8B (FS-8B) satellite is designed to detect and localize Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). By utilizing 2+2 CITIROC chips to manipulate 4+4 detectors, which are composed of GAGG(Ce) scintillators coupled with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and oriented in various directions to achieve all-sky coverage, the GRB saturation fluences of GTM in the 50 keV to 1 MeV range for Short GRBs (SGRBs) and Long GRBs (LGRBs) were estimated to be about $3.1 \times 10^{-4}$ and $5.0 \times 10^{-3}\ {\rm erg/cm^2}$, respectively, based on simulations. To precisely interpret the GTM readout signal in terms of energy, several measurements for isotope and gain calibration were conducted. Despite encountering issues with crosstalk and SiPM saturation effect in the data, the energy spectrum can still be recovered by appropriately discarding channel noise and mapping with the correct ADC-to-energy relation. This paper summarizes the energy resolution of GTM and the linear variations in the relationship between photon energy and readout signal. At 662 keV, the energy resolution is about 16 %. Also, it demonstrates that greater gain is achieved by increasing voltage or decreasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Performance comparison of the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront sensors with a laser guide star for 40 m telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The new giant segmented mirror telescopes will use laser guide stars (LGS) for their adaptive optics (AO) systems. Two options to use as wavefront sensors (WFS) are the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) and the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). Aims. In this paper, we compare the noise performance of the PWFS and the SHWFS. We aim to find which of the two WFS is the best to use in a single or tomographic configuration. Methods. To compute the noise performance we extended a noise model developed for the PWFS to be used with the SHWFS. To do this, we expressed the centroiding algorithm of the SHWFS as a matrix-vector multiplication, which allowed us to use the statistics of noise to compute its propagation through the AO loop. We validated the noise model with end-to-end simulations for telescopes of 8 and 16 m in diameter. Results. For an AO system with only one WFS, we found that, given the same number of subapertures, the PWFS outperforms the SHWFS. For a 40 m telescope, the limiting magnitude of the PWFS is around 1 magnitude higher than the SHWFS. When using multiple WFS and a Generalized least squares estimator to combine the signal, our model predicts that in a tomographic system, the SHWFS performs better than the PWFS having a limiting magnitude 0.3 magnitudes higher. If using sub-electron RON detectors for the PWFS, then the performances are almost identical between the two WFSs Conclusions. We conclude that when using a single WFS with LGS, the PWFS is a better alternative than the SH. However, for a tomographic system, either would have almost the same performance.</description>

      <title>Robust, Rapid, and Simple Gravitational-wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and robust parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources is a key component of modern multi-messenger astronomy. We present a novel and straightforward method for rapid parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources that uses metric-based importance sampling. The method enables robust parameter estimation of binary neutron star and binary black hole binaries and is trivially parallelized, enabling full parameter estimation in seconds with modest resources. The algorithm achieves an average 35% effective sampling efficiency for the majority of aligned-spin neutron star binaries sources. Surprisingly, this approach is also highly efficient for analyzing the full 15-dimensional parameter space of typical binary black holes, with 20% efficiency achieved for a source detected primarily by the twin LIGO observatories and 9% for a network of three comparable sensitivity observatories. This method can serve immediate use to improve the low-latency data products of the gravitational-wave observatory network and may be a key component of how the millions of sources observed by next-generation observatories could be analyzed. The approach can also be broadly applied for problems where an approximate likelihood metric-space can be constructed.</description>

      <title>LOO-PIT: A sensitive posterior test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the next generation of astrophysics experiments, the volume of data available to researchers will be greater than ever. As these projects will significantly drive down statistical uncertainties in measurements, it is crucial to develop novel tools to assess the ability of our models to fit these data within the specified errors. We introduce to astronomy the Leave One Out-Probability Integral Transform (LOO-PIT) technique. This first estimates the LOO posterior predictive distributions based on the model and likelihood distribution specified, then evaluates the quality of the match between the model and data by applying the PIT to each estimated distribution and data point, outputting a LOO-PIT distribution. Deviations between this output distribution and that expected can be characterised visually and with a standard Kolmogorov--Smirnov distribution test. We compare LOO-PIT and the more common $\chi^2$ test using both a simplified model and a more realistic astrophysics problem, where we consider fitting Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in galaxy survey data with contamination from emission line interlopers. LOO-PIT and $\chi^2$ tend to find different signals from the contaminants, and using these tests in conjunction increases the statistical power compared to using either test alone. We also show that LOO-PIT outperforms $\chi^2$ in certain realistic test cases.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit lightcurves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameters spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multi-planet transit lightcurves that display transit-timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning generated observations of galaxy clusters from dark-matter-only simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations play a fundamental role in modern cosmological research, serving as a crucial bridge between theoretical predictions and observational data. However, due to their computational intensity, these simulations are currently constrained to relatively small volumes. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of utilising dark matter-only simulations to generate observable maps of galaxy clusters using a deep learning approach based on the U-Net architecture. We focus on reconstructing Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps (X-ray maps) from total mass density maps. We leverage data from \textsc{The Three Hundred} simulations, selecting galaxy clusters ranging in mass from $10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, the predictions show excellent agreement with the ground-truth datasets, with percentage errors averaging (0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% for the parameters of the scaling laws.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LX. Molecular line list for the ammonia isotopologue $^{15}$NH$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical line list for $^{15}$NH$_3$ CoYuTe-15 is presented based on the empirical potential energy and ab initio dipole moments surfaces developed and used for the production of the ExoMol line list CoYuTe for $^{14}$NH$_3$. The ro-vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions are computed using the variational program TROVE. The line list ranges up to 10000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda \geq 1$~$\mu$m) and contains 929 795 249 transitions between 1 269 961 states with $J\le 30$. The line list should be applicable for temperatures up to $\sim$1000 K. To improve the accuracy of the line positions, a set of experimentally-derived energy levels of $^{15}$NH$_3$ is produced using the MARVEL procedure. To this end, 37 experimental sources of the line positions of $^{15}$NH$_3$ available in the literature are collected, combined and systematised to produce a self-consistent spectroscopic network of 21095 $^{15}$NH$_3$ transitions covering 40 vibrational bands ranging up to 6818 cm$^{-1}$ and resulting in 2777 energy term values. These MARVEL energies are then used to replace the theoretical values in the CoYuTe-15 line list and also complemented by pseudo-MARVEL energies obtained by an isotopologue extrapolation using the previously reported MARVEL energies of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ parent isotopologue of ammonia. A list of 53856 high resolution transitions between MARVEL states and theoretical intensities is provided in the HITRAN format. Comparison with the recent experimental spectra of $^{15}$NH$_3$ illustrate the potential of the line list for detections and as an efficient assistant in spectroscopic assignments. The line list is available from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Frequency Comb Calibrated Laser Heterodyne Radiometry for Precision Radial Velocity Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disk-integrated observations of the Sun provide a unique vantage point to explore stellar activity and its effect on measured radial velocities. Here, we report a new approach for disk-integrated solar spectroscopy and evaluate its capabilities for solar radial velocity measurements. Our approach is based on a near-infrared laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR) combined with an optical frequency comb calibration, and we show that this combination enables precision, disk-integrated solar spectroscopy with high spectral resolution (~800,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (~2,600), and absolute frequency accuracy. We use the comb-calibrated LHR to record spectra of the solar Fe I 1565 nm transition over a six-week period. We show that our measurements reach sub-meter-per-second radial velocity precision over a single day, and we use daily measurements of the absolute line center to assess the long-term stability of the comb-calibrated LHR approach. We use this long-duration dataset to quantify the principal uncertainty sources that impact the measured radial velocities, and we discuss future modifications that can further improve this approach in studies of stellar variability and its impact on radial velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>Close Encounters of the LEO Kind: Spillovers and Resilience in Partially-Automated Traffic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic systems are becoming increasingly automated. How will automated objects interact with non-automated objects? How will partially-automated systems handle large disruptions? Low-Earth orbit (LEO) -- filled with thousands of automated and non-automated satellites and many more uncontrollable pieces of debris -- offers a useful laboratory for these questions. I exploit the COSMOS-1408 (C1408) anti-satellite missile test of November 2021 -- a large and exogenous shock to the orbital environment -- to study how an unexpected disruption affects a partially-automated traffic system. I use publicly-available close approach data, network theory, and an econometric analysis of the C1408 test to study the effect of close encounters with new fragments on the configuration of objects in orbit. I document spillover effects of close encounters with C1408 fragments, heterogeneity in impacts across operators, and changes in system-level resilience to new shocks. These results shed light on the nature of partially-automated traffic systems, and provide a basis for new models to anticipate and mitigate space traffic disruptions.</description>

Abstract: Gen TSO is a noise calculator specifically tailored to simulate James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) time-series observations of exoplanets. Gen TSO enables the estimation of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for transit or eclipse depths through an interactive graphical interface, similar to the JWST Exposure Time Calculator (ETC). This interface leverages the ETC by combining its noise simulator, Pandeia, with additional exoplanet resources from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, the Gaia DR3 catalog of stellar sources, and the TrExoLiSTS database of JWST programs. The initial release of Gen TSO allows users to calculate S/Ns for all JWST instruments for the spectroscopic time-series modes available as of the Cycle 4 GO call. Additionally, Gen TSO allows users to simulate target acquisition on the science targets or, when needed, on nearby stellar targets within the visit splitting distance. This article presents an overview of Gen TSO and its main functionalities. Gen TSO has been designed to provide both an intuitive graphical interface and a modular API to access the resources mentioned above, facilitating planing and simulation of JWST exoplanet time-series observations. Gen TSO is available for installation via the Python Package Index and its documentation can be found at pcubillos.github.io/gen_tso.</description>

      <title>Robust Discontinuous Galerkin Methods Maintaining Physical Constraints for General Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) presents challenges such as handling curved spacetime, achieving high-order shock-capturing accuracy, and preserving key physical constraints (positive density, pressure, and subluminal velocity) under nonlinear coupling. This paper introduces high-order, physical-constraint-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (PCP-OEDG) schemes with Harten-Lax-van Leer flux for GRHD. To suppress spurious oscillations near discontinuities, we incorporate a computationally efficient oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure based on a linear damping equation, maintaining accuracy and avoiding complex characteristic decomposition. To enhance stability and robustness, we construct PCP schemes using the W-form of GRHD equations with Cholesky decomposition of the spatial metric, addressing the non-equivalence of admissible state sets in curved spacetime. We rigorously prove the PCP property of cell averages via technical estimates and the Geometric Quasi-Linearization (GQL) approach, which transforms nonlinear constraints into linear forms. Additionally, we present provably convergent PCP iterative algorithms for robust recovery of primitive variables, ensuring physical constraints are satisfied throughout. The PCP-OEDG method is validated through extensive tests, demonstrating its robustness, accuracy, and capability to handle extreme GRHD scenarios involving strong shocks, high Lorentz factors, and intense gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we present a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth, focusing on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input features, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for the period 2010 to 2019. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple but robust machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities and effectively aggravates the space weather forecasts in operational settings. We show how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Upgrading SPHERE with the second stage AO system SAXO+: frequency-based data-driven controller for adaptive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel frequency-based data-driven controller for adaptive optics, using power spectral density for optimization while ensuring stability criteria. It addresses disturbance rejection, command amplitude constraints and system transfer functions through convex optimization to obtain an optimal control in an infinite input response filter form. Evaluated within the SAXO+ project, it demonstrates efficacy under diverse atmospheric conditions and operational scenarios. The proposed controller is tested in both standard and disentangled adaptive optics schemes, showcasing its adaptability and performance. Experimental validation is conducted using the COMPASS simulation tool, affirming the controller's promise for enhancing adaptive optics systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing your Observatory's Impact: Best Practices in Establishing and Maintaining Observatory Bibliographies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observatories need to measure and evaluate the scientific output and overall impact of their facilities. An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory's data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.</description>

      <title>Modeling the wavelength dependence of pixel response non-uniformity of a CCD sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements in astronomy require stringent control of systematics such as those arising from imperfect correction of sensor effects. In this work, we develop a parametric method to model the wavelength dependence of pixel response non-uniformity (PRNU) for a laser-annealed backside-illuminated charge-coupled device. The model accurately reproduces the PRNU patterns of flat-field images taken at nine wavelengths from 290nm to 950nm, leaving the root mean square (RMS) residuals no more than 0.2% in most cases. By removing the large-scale non-uniformity in the flat fields, the RMS residuals are further reduced. This model fitting approach gives more accurate predictions of the PRNU than cubic-spline interpolation does with fewer free parameters. It can be applied to make PRNU corrections for individual objects according to their spectral energy distribution to reduce the photometry errors caused by the wavelength-dependent PRNU, if sub-percent level precision is required.</description>

      <title>Six Maxims of Statistical Acumen for Astronomical Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of complex astronomical data is accelerating, especially with newer telescopes producing ever more large-scale surveys. The increased quantity, complexity, and variety of astronomical data demand a parallel increase in skill and sophistication in developing, deciding, and deploying statistical methods. Understanding limitations and appreciating nuances in statistical and machine learning methods and the reasoning behind them is essential for improving data-analytic proficiency and acumen. Aiming to facilitate such improvement in astronomy, we delineate cautionary tales in statistics via six maxims, with examples drawn from the astronomical literature. Inspired by the significant quality improvement in business and manufacturing processes by the routine adoption of Six Sigma, we hope the routine reflection on these Six Maxims will improve the quality of both data analysis and scientific findings in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Standardised formats and open-source analysis tools for the MAGIC telescopes data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruments for gamma-ray astronomy at Very High Energies ($E&gt;100\,{\rm GeV}$) have traditionally derived their scientific results through proprietary data and software. Data standardisation has become a prominent issue in this field both as a requirement for the dissemination of data from the next generation of gamma-ray observatories and as an effective solution to realise public data legacies of current-generation instruments. Specifications for a standardised gamma-ray data format have been proposed as a community effort and have already been successfully adopted by several instruments.
  We present the first production of standardised data from the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes. We converted $166\,{\rm h}$ of observations from different sources and validated their analysis with the open-source software Gammapy.
  We consider six data sets representing different scientific and technical analysis cases and compare the results obtained analysing the standardised data with open-source software against those produced with the MAGIC proprietary data and software. Aiming at a systematic production of MAGIC data in this standardised format, we also present the implementation of a database-driven pipeline automatically performing the MAGIC data reduction from the calibrated down to the standardised data level.
  In all the cases selected for the validation, we obtain results compatible with the MAGIC proprietary software, both for the manual and for the automatic data productions. Part of the validation data set is also made publicly available, thus representing the first large public release of MAGIC data.
  This effort and this first data release represent a technical milestone toward the realisation of a public MAGIC data legacy.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries Using Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging MBHBs is of great significance for the global fitting of all resolvable sources, as well as the astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave signals. However, such analyses usually entail significant computational costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in generative models, we explore the application of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) on the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Specifically, we employ linear interpolation and trig interpolation methods to construct transport paths for training CNFs. Additionally, we creatively introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within CNFs, allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time, within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence of astrophysical confusion noise using CNFs. In the experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Water in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI: spectral excitation atlas, diagnostic diagrams for temperature and column density, and detection of disk-rotation line broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims at providing fundamental general tools for the analysis of water spectra as observed in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI. We analyze 25 high-quality spectra from the JDISC Survey reduced with asteroid calibrators as presented in Pontoppidan et al. 2024. First, we present a spectral atlas to illustrate the clustering of water transitions from different upper level energies ($E_u$) and identify single (un-blended) lines that provide the most reliable measurements. With the atlas, we demonstrate two important excitation effects: one related to the opacity saturation of ortho-para line pairs that overlap, and the other to the sub-thermal excitation of $v=1-1$ lines scattered across the $v=0-0$ rotational band. Second, from this larger line selection we define a list of fundamental lines spanning $E_u$ from 1500 to 6000 K to develop simple line-ratio diagrams as diagnostics of temperature components and column density. Third, we report the detection of disk-rotation Doppler broadening of molecular lines, which demonstrates the radial distribution of water emission at different $E_u$ and confirms from gas kinematics a radially-extended $\approx 170$--220 K reservoir, close to the ice sublimation front. We also report the detection of narrow blue-shifted absorption from an inner disk wind in ro-vibrational H2O and CO lines, which may be observed in disks at inclinations $&gt; 50$ deg. We summarize these findings and tools into a general recipe that should be beneficial to community efforts to study water in planet-forming regions.</description>
