      <title>Referenceless Proton Resonance Frequency Thermometry Using Deep Learning with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accurate proton resonance frequency (PRF) MR thermometry is essential for monitoring temperature rise during thermal ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound (FUS). Conventional referenceless methods such as complex field estimation (CFE) and phase finite difference (PFD) tend to exhibit errors when susceptibility-induced phase discontinuities occur at tissue interfaces.</description>

      <title>Robust External-Beam Calibration of Plastic Scintillation Detectors for In-Vivo Dosimetry in HDR Brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: HDR brachytherapy is a widely adopted modality for cancer treatment. However, it is not free from error and uncertainty. In-vivo dosimetry (IVD) is the only technique that can confirm correct dose delivery. This study details and validates a calibration method for Plastic Scintillation Detector (PSD), bypassing dose gradient and positioning issues in brachytherapy calibration. Methods: The PRB-0057 PSD (Medscint, Canada) was calibrated, 1x1 mm scintillating fiber coupled to a 20 m Eska GH-4001 clear optical fiber (Mitsubishi Rayon, Japan). The fiber is connected to the Hyperscint-RP200 research platform for signal collection. Hyperspectral calibration was performed at a LINAC with a 6 MV beam, enabling removal of stem effects before brachytherapy measurements. For validation, an Iridium-192 Flexisource (Elekta Brachy, The Netherlands), Sk=29447U, was used in a motorized IBA-Blue-Phantom2 water tank (48x48x41cm3). Dose rates were measured at 10 Hz along the source z-axis at a fixed transverse distance of 1.2+/-0.05 cm in 0.2 cm steps. Relative difference (RD) between measured and TG-43U1 dose rates was assessed. A detailed uncertainty budget was associated with brachytherapy measurements. Results: Comparison shows good agreement with RD around 2.5 $\%$ at 1.2 cm, corresponding to positional uncertainties of &lt;0.15 mm. At greater depths up to 8 cm, RDs increase to about 5 $\%$, mainly due to reduced light yield. Uncertainties depend on the source-detector distance, ranging from 3.81 to 6.39 $\%$ (k=1) over the explored range. Conclusions: Results confirm the PSD calibration effectiveness using a 6MV external beam with hyperspectral technique. Uncertainties close to the source align with positional errors and are dominated by reduced PSD sensitivity at larger distances. The study underlined the intrinsic limitation of IVD in the face of known uncertainties.</description>

      <title>In-vivo 6D heart motion analysis for emerging self-powered cardiac implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-powered intracardiac implant devices show great promise for future clinical applications due to their extended operational lifespan and the potential to reduce the need for high-risk repeat surgeries. This study investigates the feasibility of harvesting energy from cardiac motion through in vivo testing of intracardiac devices. Comprehensive three-dimensional translational and rotational cardiac motions are captured in a porcine model using a miniaturized 9-degree-of-freedom motion sensor implanted at six strategic epicardial sites. Kinematic criteria are developed to evaluate the energy harvesting potential of each implant site based on the available kinetic energy, acceleration, and jerk factors. The recorded heart motion signals are analyzed and applied to a conceptual energy harvester proposed to identify the optimal implant site. The results reveal that the left ventricular apex emerges as a preferable site for energy harvesting, particularly at moderate heart rates. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing self-powered intracardiac implants, reducing dependency on battery replacements, and enhancing long-term patient safety.</description>

      <title>PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Diffusion Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets. For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested on [$^{18}$F]FDG data and amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one [$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types, providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET imaging.</description>
