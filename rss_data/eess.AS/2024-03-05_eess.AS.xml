      <title>Efficient Adapter Tuning of Pre-trained Speech Models for Automatic Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With excellent generalization ability, self-supervised speech models have shown impressive performance on various downstream speech tasks in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, as the growing size of pre-trained models, fine-tuning becomes practically unfeasible due to heavy computation and storage overhead, as well as the risk of overfitting. Adapters are lightweight modules inserted into pre-trained models to facilitate parameter-efficient adaptation. In this paper, we propose an effective adapter framework designed for adapting self-supervised speech models to the speaker verification task. With a parallel adapter design, our proposed framework inserts two types of adapters into the pre-trained model, allowing the adaptation of latent features within intermediate Transformer layers and output embeddings from all Transformer layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb1 dataset demonstrate that the proposed adapters surpass fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods, achieving superior performance while updating only 5% of the parameters.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Frequency Bands on Acoustic Anomaly Detection of Machines using Deep Learning Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model for Acoustic Anomaly Detection of Machines, the task for detecting abnormal machines by analysing the machine sound. By conducting extensive experiments, we indicate that multiple techniques of pseudo audios, audio segment, data augmentation, Mahalanobis distance, and narrow frequency bands, which mainly focus on feature engineering, are effective to enhance the system performance. Among the evaluating techniques, the narrow frequency bands presents a significant impact. Indeed, our proposed model, which focuses on the narrow frequency bands, outperforms the DCASE baseline on the benchmark dataset of DCASE 2022 Task 2 Development set. The important role of the narrow frequency bands indicated in this paper inspires the research community on the task of Acoustic Anomaly Detection of Machines to further investigate and propose novel network architectures focusing on the frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Transcription and translation of videos using fine-tuned XLSR Wav2Vec2 on custom dataset and mBART</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of training an ASR model for personalized voices with minimal data. Utilizing just 14 minutes of custom audio from a YouTube video, we employ Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion (RVC) to create a custom Common Voice 16.0 corpus. Subsequently, a Cross-lingual Self-supervised Representations (XLSR) Wav2Vec2 model is fine-tuned on this dataset. The developed web-based GUI efficiently transcribes and translates input Hindi videos. By integrating XLSR Wav2Vec2 and mBART, the system aligns the translated text with the video timeline, delivering an accessible solution for multilingual video content transcription and translation for personalized voice.</description>

      <title>CustomListener: Text-guided Responsive Interaction for User-friendly Listening Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Listening head generation aims to synthesize a non-verbal responsive listener head by modeling the correlation between the speaker and the listener in dynamic conversion.The applications of listener agent generation in virtual interaction have promoted many works achieving the diverse and fine-grained motion generation. However, they can only manipulate motions through simple emotional labels, but cannot freely control the listener's motions. Since listener agents should have human-like attributes (e.g. identity, personality) which can be freely customized by users, this limits their realism. In this paper, we propose a user-friendly framework called CustomListener to realize the free-form text prior guided listener generation. To achieve speaker-listener coordination, we design a Static to Dynamic Portrait module (SDP), which interacts with speaker information to transform static text into dynamic portrait token with completion rhythm and amplitude information. To achieve coherence between segments, we design a Past Guided Generation Module (PGG) to maintain the consistency of customized listener attributes through the motion prior, and utilize a diffusion-based structure conditioned on the portrait token and the motion prior to realize the controllable generation. To train and evaluate our model, we have constructed two text-annotated listening head datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk, which provide text-video paired labels. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Post-decoder Biasing for End-to-End Speech Recognition of Multi-turn Medical Interview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) approach is gradually replacing hybrid models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. However, the optimization of E2E models lacks an intuitive method for handling decoding shifts, especially in scenarios with a large number of domain-specific rare words that hold specific important meanings. Furthermore, the absence of knowledge-intensive speech datasets in academia has been a significant limiting factor, and the commonly used speech corpora exhibit significant disparities with realistic conversation. To address these challenges, we present Medical Interview (MED-IT), a multi-turn consultation speech dataset that contains a substantial number of knowledge-intensive named entities. We also explore methods to enhance the recognition performance of rare words for E2E models. We propose a novel approach, post-decoder biasing, which constructs a transform probability matrix based on the distribution of training transcriptions. This guides the model to prioritize recognizing words in the biasing list. In our experiments, for subsets of rare words appearing in the training speech between 10 and 20 times, and between 1 and 5 times, the proposed method achieves a relative improvement of 9.3% and 5.1%, respectively.</description>

      <title>VoxGenesis: Unsupervised Discovery of Latent Speaker Manifold for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving nuanced and accurate emulation of human voice has been a longstanding goal in artificial intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the mainstream of speech synthesis models still relies on supervised speaker modeling and explicit reference utterances. However, there are many aspects of human voice, such as emotion, intonation, and speaking style, for which it is hard to obtain accurate labels. In this paper, we propose VoxGenesis, a novel unsupervised speech synthesis framework that can discover a latent speaker manifold and meaningful voice editing directions without supervision. VoxGenesis is conceptually simple. Instead of mapping speech features to waveforms deterministically, VoxGenesis transforms a Gaussian distribution into speech distributions conditioned and aligned by semantic tokens. This forces the model to learn a speaker distribution disentangled from the semantic content. During the inference, sampling from the Gaussian distribution enables the creation of novel speakers with distinct characteristics. More importantly, the exploration of latent space uncovers human-interpretable directions associated with specific speaker characteristics such as gender attributes, pitch, tone, and emotion, allowing for voice editing by manipulating the latent codes along these identified directions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed VoxGenesis using both subjective and objective metrics, finding that it produces significantly more diverse and realistic speakers with distinct characteristics than the previous approaches. We also show that latent space manipulation produces consistent and human-identifiable effects that are not detrimental to the speech quality, which was not possible with previous approaches.

      <title>Neural Steerer: Novel Steering Vector Synthesis with a Causal Neural Field over Frequency and Source Positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of accurately interpolating measured anechoic steering vectors with a deep learning framework called the neural field. This task plays a pivotal role in reducing the resource-intensive measurements required for precise sound source separation and localization, essential as the front-end of speech recognition. Classical approaches to interpolation rely on linear weighting of nearby measurements in space on a fixed, discrete set of frequencies. Drawing inspiration from the success of neural fields for novel view synthesis in computer vision, we introduce the neural steerer, a continuous complex-valued function that takes both frequency and direction as input and produces the corresponding steering vector. Importantly, it incorporates inter-channel phase difference information and a regularization term enforcing filter causality, essential for accurate steering vector modeling. Our experiments, conducted using a dataset of real measured steering vectors, demonstrate the effectiveness of our resolution-free model in interpolating such measurements.</description>

      <title>Multi-Input Multi-Output Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection For Unified, Flexible, and Robust Audio-Visual Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-visual learning has demonstrated promising results in many classical speech tasks (e.g., speech separation, automatic speech recognition, wake-word spotting). We believe that introducing visual modality will also benefit speaker diarization. To date, Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) plays an important role in highly accurate speaker diarization. However, previous TS-VAD models take audio features and utilize the speaker's acoustic footprint to distinguish his or her personal speech activities, which is easily affected by overlapped speech in multi-speaker scenarios. Although visual information naturally tolerates overlapped speech, it suffers from spatial occlusion, low resolution, etc. The potential modality-missing problem blocks TS-VAD towards an audio-visual approach.
  This paper proposes a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (MIMO-TSVAD) framework for speaker diarization. The proposed method can take audio-visual input and leverage the speaker's acoustic footprint or lip track to flexibly conduct audio-based, video-based, and audio-visual speaker diarization in a unified sequence-to-sequence framework. Experimental results show that the MIMO-TSVAD framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the VoxConverse, DIHARD-III, and MISP 2022 datasets under corresponding evaluation metrics, obtaining the Diarization Error Rates (DERs) of 4.18%, 10.10%, and 8.15%, respectively. In addition, it can perform robustly in heavy lip-missing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Anonymizing Speech: Evaluating and Designing Speaker Anonymization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing use of voice user interfaces has led to a surge in the collection and storage of speech data. While data collection allows for the development of efficient tools powering most speech services, it also poses serious privacy issues for users as centralized storage makes private personal speech data vulnerable to cyber threats. With the increasing use of voice-based digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home, and Apple's Siri, and with the increasing ease with which personal speech data can be collected, the risk of malicious use of voice-cloning and speaker/gender/pathological/etc. recognition has increased.
  This thesis proposes solutions for anonymizing speech and evaluating the degree of the anonymization. In this work, anonymization refers to making personal speech data unlinkable to an identity while maintaining the usefulness (utility) of the speech signal (e.g., access to linguistic content). We start by identifying several challenges that evaluation protocols need to consider to evaluate the degree of privacy protection properly. We clarify how anonymization systems must be configured for evaluation purposes and highlight that many practical deployment configurations do not permit privacy evaluation. Furthermore, we study and examine the most common voice conversion-based anonymization system and identify its weak points before suggesting new methods to overcome some limitations. We isolate all components of the anonymization system to evaluate the degree of speaker PPI associated with each of them. Then, we propose several transformation methods for each component to reduce as much as possible speaker PPI while maintaining utility. We promote anonymization algorithms based on quantization-based transformation as an alternative to the most-used and well-known noise-based approach. Finally, we endeavor a new attack method to invert anonymization.</description>
