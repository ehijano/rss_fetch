      <title>On Polyconvexity and Almgren Uniform Ellipticity With Respect to Polyhedral Test Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study anisotropic geometric energy functionals defined on a class of k-dimensional surfaces in a Euclidean space. The classical notion of ellipticity, coming from Almgren, for such functionals is investigated. We extend a recent result of De Rosa, Lei, and Young and show that uniform ellipticity of an anisotropic energy functional with respect to real polyhedral chains implies uniform polyconvexity of the integrand.</description>

      <title>The Monge-Ampere system in dimension two and codimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the convex integration constructions for the Monge-Amp\`ere system and prove its flexibility in dimension $d=2$ and codimension $k=3$, up to $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-1/\sqrt{5}}$. To our knowledge, it is the first result in which the obtained H\"older exponent $1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ is larger than $1/2$ but it is not contained in the full flexibility up to $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$ result. Previous various approaches, based on Kuiper's corrugations, always led to the H\"older regularity not exceeding $\mathcal{C}^{1,1/2}$, while constructions based on the Nash spirals (when applicable) led to the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$. Combining the two approaches towards an interpolation between their corresponding exponent ranges has been so far an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the existence and of solutions for the Euler-plate free-boundary system modeling an interaction of a three-dimensional inviscid fluid and an evolving plate. We prove the local existence and uniqueness of solutions for initial fluid and structural velocities belonging to $H^{2.5+}$ and $H^{2+}$, respectively. The results justify earlier a~priori estimates shown by two of the authors.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic stability of a generic Lotka-Volterra system with nonlinear spatially heterogeneous cross-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers a class of Lotka-Volterra systems with multiple nonlinear cross-diffusion, commonly known as prey-taxis models. The existence and stability of classic solutions for such systems with spatially homogeneous sources and taxis have been studied in one- or two-dimensional space, however, the proof is non-trivial for a more general setting with spatially heterogeneous predation functions and taxis coefficient functions in arbitrary dimensions. This study introduces a new weighted \(L_\epsilon^p\)-norm and extends some classical inequalities within this normed space. Coupled energy estimates are employed to establish initial bounds, followed by applying heat kernel properties and an advanced bootstrap process to enhance solution regularity. For stability analysis, we extend LaSalle's invariance principle to a general \( L^\infty \) setting and utilize it alongside Lyapunov functions to analyze the stability of each possible constant equilibrium. All results are achieved without introducing an extra logistic growth term for predators or imposing smallness conditions on taxis coefficients.</description>

      <title>On existence and uniqueness for transport equations with non-smooth velocity fields under inhomogeneous Dirichlet data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transport equation with a non-smooth velocity field is considered under inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spatial gradient of the velocity field is assumed in $L^{p'}$ in space and the divergence of the velocity field is assumed to be bounded. By introducing a suitable notion of solutions, it is shown that there exists a unique renormalized weak solution for $L^p$ initial and boundary data for $1/p+1/p'=1$. Our theory is considered as a natural extension of the theory due to DiPerna and Lions (1989), where there is no boundary. Although a smooth domain is considered, it is allowed to be unbounded. A key step is a mollification of a solution. In our theory, mollification in the direction normal to the boundary is tailored to approximate the boundary data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Li-Yau gradient estimate for positive solutions to the heat equation defined on a metric star graph $\mG$ given by the heat kernel formula. As consequence, we derive a Harnack estimate and a Liouville property for bounded harmonic functions. The argument exploits an explicit representation formula for the heat kernel on $\mG$.</description>

      <title>Replicator dynamics as the large population limit of a discrete Moran process in the weak selection regime: A proof via Eulerian specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large population limit of a multi-strategy discrete-time Moran process in the weak selection regime. We show that the replicator dynamics is interpreted as the large-population limit of the Moran process. This result is obtained by interpreting the discrete process in its Eulerian specification, proving a compactness result in the Wasserstein space of probability measures for the law of the proportions of strategies, and passing to the limit in the continuity equation that describes the evolution of the proportions.</description>

      <title>Exponential stability for an infinite memory wave equation with frictional damping and logarithmic nonlinear terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the energy decay of an infinite memory wave equation with a logarithmic nonlinear term and a frictional damping term. The problem is formulated in a bounded domain in $\mathbb R^d$ ($d\ge3$) with a smooth boundary, on which we prescribe a mixed boundary condition of the Dirichlet and the acoustic types. We establish an exponential decay result for the energy with a general material density $\rho(x)$ under certain assumptions on the involved coefficients. The proof is based on a contradiction argument, the multiplier method and some microlocal analysis techniques. In addition, if $\rho(x)$ takes a special form, our result even holds without the damping effect, that is, the infinite memory effect alone is strong enough to guarantee the exponential stability of the system.</description>

      <title>Kink dynamics for the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12790v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considered in this work is the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, a physically motivated mathematical model introduced by Bizo\'n and Kahl. The kink is a fundamental, strongly unstable stationary solution in this non-perturbative, variable coefficients model, with a polynomial tail and no explicit form. In this paper, we introduce and extend several virial techniques, adapt them to the inhomogeneous medium setting, and construct a finite codimensional manifold of the energy space where the kink is asymptotically stable. In particular, we handle, using virial techniques, the emergence of a weak threshold resonance in the description of the stable manifold.</description>

      <title>Critical Equations Involving Nonlocal Subelliptic Operators on Stratified Lie Groups: Spectrum, Bifurcation and Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bifurcation phenomena and establish the existence of multiple solutions for the nonlocal subelliptic Brezis-Nirenberg problem:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} (-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}})^s u= |u|^{2_s^*-2}u+\lambda u \quad &amp;\text{in}\quad \Omega, \\ u=0\quad &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{G}\backslash \Omega, \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} where $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}})^s$ is the fractional sub-Laplacian on the stratified Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ with homogeneous dimension $Q,$ $\Omega$ is a open bounded subset of $\mathbb{G},$ $s \in (0,1)$, $Q&gt; 2s,$ $2_s^*:=\frac{2Q}{Q-2s}$ is subelliptic fractional Sobolev critical exponent, $\lambda&gt;0$ is a real parameter. This work extends the seminal contributions of Cerami, Fortunato, and Struwe to nonlocal subelliptic operators on stratified Lie groups. A key component of our study involves analyzing the subelliptic $(s, p)$-eigenvalue problem for the (nonlinear) fractional $p$-sub-Laplacian $(-\Delta_{p,{\mathbb{G}}})^s$ \begin{align*}
  (-\Delta_{p,{\mathbb{G}}})^s u&amp;=\lambda |u|^{p-2}u,~\text{in}~\Omega,\nonumber
  u&amp;=0~\text{ in }~{\mathbb{G}}\setminus\Omega, \end{align*} with $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $Q&gt;ps$, over the fractional Folland-Stein-Sobolev spaces on stratified Lie groups applying variational methods. Particularly, we prove that the $(s, p)$-spectrum of $(-\Delta_{p,{\mathbb{G}}})^s$ is closed and the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(\Omega)$ with $\lambda_2(\Omega)&gt;\lambda_1(\Omega)$ is well-defined and provides a variational characterization of $\lambda_2(\Omega)$. We emphasize that the results obtained here are also novel for $\mathbb{G}$ being the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling and homogenization of thin fiber-reinforced hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers simultaneous homogenization dimension reduction of a poroelastic model for thin fiber-reinforced hydrogels. The analysed medium is defined as a two-component system consisting of a continuous fiber framework with hydrogel inclusions arranged periodically throughout. The fibers are assumed to operate under quasi-stationary linear elasticity, whereas the hydrogel's hydromechanical behavior is represented using Biot's linear poroelasticity model. The asymptotic limit of the coupled system is established when the periodicity and thickness parameters are of the same order and tend to zero simultaneously, utilizing the re-scaling unfolding operator. It is demonstrated that the limit displacement exhibits Kirchhoff-Love-type behavior through Griso's decomposition of plate displacements. Towards the end, a unique solution for the macroscopic problem has been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>On nodal solutions with a prescribed number of nodes for a Kirchhoff-type problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence and asymptotic behavior of multiple radial sign-changing solutions with the nodal characterization for a Kirchhoff-type problem involving the nonlinearity $|u|^{p-2}u(2&lt;p&lt;4)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. By developing some useful analysis techniques and introducing a novel definition of the Nehari manifold for the auxiliary system of the equations, we show that, for any positive integer $k$, the problem has a sign-changing solution $u_k^b$ changing signs exactly $k$ times. Furthermore, the energy of $u_k^b$ is strictly increasing in $k$, as well as some asymptotic behaviors of $u_k^b$ are obtained. Our result is a complement of [Deng Y, Peng S, Shuai W, {\it J. Funct. Anal.}, {\bf269}(2015), 3500-3527], where the case $2&lt;p&lt;4$ is left open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a microscopic model of $N$ magnetic nanoparticles in a Stokes flow. We assume that the temperature is above the critical N\'eel temperature such that the particles' magnetizations undergo random flip with rate $1/\varepsilon$. The microscopic system is the modeled through a piecewise deterministic Markov jump process. We show that for large $N$, small particle volume fraction and small $\varepsilon$, the system can be effectively described by a multiscale model.</description>

      <title>Logistic diffusion equations governed by the superposition of operators of mixed fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the existence of stationary solutions for logistic diffusion equations of Fisher-Kolmogoroff-Petrovski-Piskunov type driven by the superposition of fractional operators in a bounded region with "hostile" environmental conditions, modeled by homogeneous external Dirichlet data.
  We provide a range of results on the existence and nonexistence of solutions tied to the spectral properties of the ambient space, corresponding to either survival or extinction of the population.
  We also discuss how the possible presence of nonlocal phenomena of concentration and diffusion affect the endurance or disappearance of the population.
  In particular, we give examples in which both classical and anomalous diffusion leads to the extinction of the species, while the presence of an arbitrarily small concentration pattern enables survival.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties for $p-$dead core problems and their asymptotic limit as $p \to \infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity issues and the limiting behavior as $p\to\infty$ of nonnegative solutions for elliptic equations of $p-$Laplacian type ($2 \leq p&lt; \infty$) with a strong absorption: $$
  -\Delta_p u(x) + \lambda_0(x) u_{+}^q(x) = 0 \quad \text{ in } \quad \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N, $$ where $\lambda_0&gt;0$ is a bounded function, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain and $0\leq q&lt;p-1$. When $p$ is fixed, such a model is mathematically interesting since it permits the formation of dead core zones, i.e, a priori unknown regions where non-negative solutions vanish identically. First, we turn our attention to establishing sharp quantitative regularity properties for $p-$dead core solutions. Afterwards, assuming that $\ell \:=\lim_{p \to \infty} q(p)/p \in [0, 1)$ exists, we establish existence for limit solutions as $p\to \infty$, as well as we characterize the corresponding limit operator governing the limit problem. We also establish sharp $C^{\gamma}$ regularity estimates for limit solutions along free boundary points, that is, points on $ \partial \{u&gt;0\} \cap \Omega$ where the sharp regularity exponent is given explicitly by $\gamma = \frac{1}{1-\ell}$. Finally, some weak geometric and measure theoretical properties as non-degeneracy, uniform positive density, porosity and convergence of the free boundaries are proved.</description>

Abstract: A thermal convection flow in the three-dimensional unbounded fluid domain exterior to a sphere is considered. The viscosity force is determined by a fractional power of the Stokes operator. A purely conductive steady state arises due to the fluid heated from the sphere. A weak solution of the fluid motion problem is obtained and global stability of the steady-state solution in $L^2$ is provided.</description>

Abstract: A thermal convection fluid motion in the three-dimensional domain exterior to a sphere is considered. A purely conductive steady state arises due to the fluid heated from the sphere. A fractional equation system is introduced by using spectral presentation. The existence of small strong solutions in a Hilbert space is obtained. The strong solution existence implies the local stability of the steady state, which attracts asymptotically the flows evolving initially from the vector fields close to the steady state.</description>

      <title>Sharp regularity estimates for quasi-linear elliptic dead core problems and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we study geometric regularity estimates for quasi-linear elliptic equations of $p$-Laplace type ($1 &lt; p&lt; \infty$) with strong absorption condition: $$
  -\text{div}\,(\Phi(x, u, \nabla u)) + \lambda_0(x) u_{+}^q(x) = 0 \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N, $$ where $\Phi: \Omega \times \mathbb{R}_{+} \times \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N$ is a vector field with an appropriate $p$-structure, $\lambda_0$ is a non-negative and bounded function and $0\leq q&lt;p-1$. Such a model is mathematically relevant because permits existence of solutions with dead core zones, i.e, \textit{a priori} unknown regions where non-negative solutions vanish identically. We establish sharp and improved $C^{\gamma}$ regularity estimates along free boundary points, namely $\mathfrak{F}_0(u, \Omega) = \partial \{u&gt;0\} \cap \Omega$, where the regularity exponent is given explicitly by $\gamma = \frac{p}{p-1-q} \gg 1$. Some weak geometric and measure theoretical properties as non-degeneracy, uniform positive density and porosity of free boundary are proved. As an application, a Liouville-type result for entire solutions is established provided that their growth at infinity can be controlled in an appropriate manner. Finally, we obtain finiteness of $(N-1)$-Hausdorff measure of free boundary for a particular class of dead core problems. The approach employed in this article is novel even to dead core problems governed by the $p$-Laplace operator $-\Delta_p u + \lambda_0 u^q\chi_{\{u&gt;0\}} = 0$ for any $\lambda_0&gt;0$. \newline \newline \noindent \textbf{Keywords:} Quasi-linear elliptic operators of $p$-Laplace type, improved regularity estimates, Free boundary problems of dead core type, Liouville type results, Hausdorff measure estimates.</description>

      <title>The distribution of negative eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the counting function of negative eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators with real valued potentials on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. We establish conditions on the potential that determine if there are finitely or infinitely many negative eigenvalues. In the latter case, they may only accumulate at zero and we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the counting function of eigenvalues in an interval $(-\infty,-E)$ as $E\rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Impact of saturation on evaporation-driven density instabilities in porous media: mathematical and numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaporation from a porous medium partially saturated with saline water, causes the salinity (salt concentration) to increase near the top of the porous medium as water leaves while salt stays behind. As the density of the water increases with increased salt concentration, the evaporation leads to a gravitational unstable setting, where density instabilities can form. Whether density instabilities form, depends on a large range of parameters like the evaporation rate and intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, but also on the water saturation. As water saturation decreases, the storage, convection and diffusion of salt also decrease, which all influence the onset of instabilities. By performing a linear stability analysis on the governing equations, we give criteria for onset of instabilities. Numerical simulations give information about the further development of these instabilities. With this knowledge we can predict whether and when density instabilities occur, and how they will influence the further development of salt concentration in the porous medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any given set $E\subset [1,2]$, we discuss a fractal frequency-localized version of the $L^p$ local smoothing estimates for the half-wave propagator with times in $E$. A conjecture is formulated in terms of a quantity involving the Assouad spectrum of $E$ and the Legendre transform. We validate the conjecture for radial functions. We also prove a similar result for fractal-time $L^2\to L^q$ and square function bounds, for arbitrary $L^2$ functions and general time sets. We formulate a conjecture for $L^p\to L^q$ generalizations.</description>

      <title>Deriving Perelman's Entropy from Colding's Monotonic Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work from 2002, Perelman introduced two fundamental monotonic quantities: the reduced volume and the entropy. While the reduced volume was motivated by the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison applied to a suitably constructed $N$-space, which becomes Ricci-flat as $N\rightarrow \infty$, Perelman did not provide a corresponding explanation for the origin of the entropy. In this article, we demonstrate that Perelman's entropy emerges as the limit of Colding's monotonic volume for harmonic functions on Ricci-flat manifolds, when appropriately applied to Perelman's $N$-space.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving mean curvature flow of round surfaces in asymptotically flat spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the volume preserving mean curvature flow of a surface immersed in an asymptotically flat $3$-manifold modeling an isolated gravitating system in General Relativity. We show that, if the ambient manifold has positive ADM mass and the initial surface is round in a suitable sense, then the flow exists for all times and converges smoothly to a stable CMC surface. This extends to the asymptotically flat setting a classical result by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math. 1996) and allows to construct a CMC foliation of the outer part of the manifold by an alternative approach to the ones by Nerz (Calc. Var. PDE, 2015) or by Eichmair-Koerber (J. Diff. Geometry, 2024).</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and resonances of dissipative acoustic operator for strictly convex obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the wave equation in the exterior of a strictly convex bounded domain $K$ with dissipative boundary condition $\partial_{\nu} u - \gamma(x) \partial_t u = 0$ on the boundary $\Gamma$ and $0 &lt; \gamma(x) &lt;1, \:\forall x \in \Gamma.$ The solutions are described by a contraction semigroup $V(t) = e^{tG}, \: t \geq 0.$ The poles $\lambda$ of the meromorphic incoming resolvent $(G - \lambda)^{-1}: \:{ \mathcal H}_{comp} \rightarrow {\mathcal D}_{loc}$ are eigenvalues of G if ${\rm Re}\: \lambda &lt; 0$ and incoming resonances if ${\rm Re}\: \lambda &gt; 0$. We obtain sharper results for the location of the eigenvalues of $G$ and incoming resonances in $\Lambda = \{\lambda \in \mathbb C:\: |{\rm Re}\: \lambda| \leq C_2(1 + |{\rm Im}\: \lambda|)^{-2},\: |{\rm Im}\: \lambda| \geq A_2 &gt; 1\}$ and we prove a Weyl formula for their asymptotic. For $K = \{x \in {\mathbb R}^3:\:|x| \leq 1\}$ and $\gamma$ constant we show that $G$ has no eigenvalues so the Weyl formula concerns only the incoming resonances.</description>

      <title>A semigroup approach to the reconstruction theorem and the multilevel Schauder estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconstruction theorem and the multilevel Schauder estimate have central roles in the analytic theory of regularity structures [17]. Inspired by [26], we provide elementary proofs for them by using the semigroup of operators. Essentially, we use only the semigroup property and the upper estimates of kernels. Moreover, we refine the several types of Besov reconstruction theorems [18, 7] and introduce the new framework "regularity-integrability structures". The analytic theorems in this paper are applied to the study of quasilinear SPDEs [5] and an inductive proof of the convergence of random models [4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study weak solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation. We first discuss existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in an irregular context, providing a unified treatment of the available literature along with some extensions. Then, we prove a regularity result for distributional solutions under suitable integrability assumptions, relying on a new, simple commutator estimate in the spirit of DiPerna-Lions' theory of renormalized solutions for the transport equation. Our result is somehow transverse to Theorem 4.3 of [15]: on the diffusion matrix we relax the assumption of Lipschitz regularity in time at the price of assuming Sobolev regularity in space, and we prove the regularity (and hence the uniqueness) of distributional solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic homogenization for a family of integral functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands defined on Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. One fundamental in this topic is to extend the classical compactness results of the two-scale convergence in the mean method to this type of spaces. Moreover, it is shown by the two-scale convergence in the mean method that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving convex functionals converges to the minimizers of a homogenized problem with a suitable convex function.</description>

We then develop several applications, including a general procedure to obtain global minimizers via blow-up limits.</description>

Abstract: We study the differential inclusion $DU\in K$, where $K$ is an unbounded and rotationally invariant subset of the real symmetric $3\times 3$ matrices. We exhibit a subset of its quasi-convex hull, i.e., the set of all possible average fields. The corresponding microgeometries are laminates of infinite rank. The problem originated in the search for the effective conductivity of polycrystalline composites. In the latter context, our result is an improvement of the previously known bounds established by Nesi $\&amp;$ Milton, hence proving the optimality of a new full-measure class of microgeometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a Fourier integral operator of order $-(n-1)/2$ associated with a canonical relation locally parametrised by a real-phase function. A fundamental result due to Seeger, Sogge, and Stein proved in the 90's, gives the boundedness of $T$ from the Hardy space $H^1$ into $L^1.$ Additionally, it was shown by T. Tao the weak (1,1) type of $T$. In this work, we establish the weak (1,1) boundedness of a Fourier integral operator $T$ of order $-(n-1)/2$ when it has associated a canonical relation parametrised by a complex phase function. This result in the complex-valued setting, cannot be derived from its counterpart in the real-valued case.</description>

      <title>Strong Convergence of Vorticities in the 2D Viscosity Limit on a Bounded Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vanishing viscosity limit from the Navier-Stokes to Euler equations on domains with boundaries, a main difficulty comes from the mismatch of boundary conditions and, consequently, the possible formation of a boundary layer. Within a purely interior framework, Constantin and Vicol showed that the two-dimensional viscosity limit is justified for any arbitrary but finite time under the assumption that on each compactly contained subset of the domain, the enstrophies are bounded uniformly along the viscosity sequence. Within this framework, we upgrade to local strong convergence of the vorticities under a similar assumption on the $p$-enstrophies, $p&gt;2$. The key novel idea is the analysis of the evolution of the weak convergence defect.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ estimates for the Laplacian via blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we provide a new proof of the $W^{2,p}$ Calder\'on-Zygmund regularity estimates for the Laplacian, i.e., $\Delta u=f$ and its parabolic counterpart $\partial_t u-\Delta u=f$. Our proof is an adaptation of a contradiction and compactness argument that so far had been only used to prove estimates in H\"older spaces. This new approach is simpler than previous ones, and avoids the use of any interpolation theorem.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for solutions to an orthotropic $q$-Laplacian-type equation in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the local Lipschitz regularity for solutions to an orthotropic q-Laplacian-type equation within the Heisenberg group. Our approach is largely inspired by the works of X. Zhong, who investigated the q-Laplacian in the same setting and proved the H\"older regularity for the gradient of solutions. Due to the degeneracy of the current equation, such regularity for the gradient of solutions is not even known in the Euclidean setting for dimensions greater than 2, where only boundedness is expected.</description>

      <title>Global Stability of the Boltzmann Equation for a Polyatomic Gas with Initial Data Allowing Large Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Boltzmann equation for a polyatomic gas. We establish that the mild solution to the Boltzmann equation on the torus is globally well-posed, provided the initial data that satisfy bounded velocity-weighted $L^{\infty}$ norm and the smallness condition on the initial relative entropy. Furthermore, we also study the asymptotic behavior of solutions, converging to the global Maxwellian with an exponential rate. A key point in the proof is to develop the pointwise estimate on the gain term of non-linear collision operator for Gr\"{o}nwall's argument.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics for the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation in critical spaces for any dimension greater or equal than three. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on initial data at or below the ground state that dichotomizes the behavior of solutions. Specifically, this criterion determines whether the solution will either exist globally with energy decaying to zero over time or blow up in finite time. Secondly, we derive the decay rate for solutions that exist globally. These results offer a comprehensive characterization of solution behavior for energy-critical conditions in higher-dimensional settings</description>

      <title>A priori estimates of solutions to local and nonlocal superlinear parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a priori estimates of possibly sign-changing solutions to superlinear parabolic problems and their applications (blow-up rates, energy blow-up, continuity of blow-up time, existence of nontrivial steady states etc). Our estimates are based mainly on energy, interpolation and bootstrap arguments, but we also use the Pohozaev identity, for example. We first discuss some known results on local problems and then consider problems with nonlocal nonlinearities or nonlocal differential operators. In particular, we deal with the fractional Laplacian and nonlinearities of Choquard type.</description>

      <title>Maximal dissipation and well-posedness of the Euler system of gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any dissipative (measure-valued) solution of the compressible Euler system that complies with Dafermos' criterion of maximal dissipation is necessarily an admissible weak solution. In addition, we propose a simple, at most two step, selection procedure to identify a unique semigroup solution in the class of dissipative solutions to the Euler system. Finally, we introduce a refined version of Dafermos' criterion yielding a unique solution of the problem for any finite energy initial data.</description>

      <title>Second-order flows for approaching stationary points of a class of non-convex energies via convex-splitting schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the exploration of a recently introduced computational paradigm known as second-order flows, which are characterized by novel dissipative hyperbolic partial differential equations extending accelerated gradient flows to energy functionals defined on Sobolev spaces, and exhibiting significant performance particularly for the minimization of non-convex energies. Our approach hinges upon convex-splitting schemes, a tool which is not only pivotal for clarifying the well-posedness of second-order flows, but also yields a versatile array of robust numerical schemes through temporal (and spatial) discretization. We prove the convergence to stationary points of such schemes in the semi-discrete setting. Further, we establish their convergence to time-continuous solutions as the timestep tends to zero. Finally, these algorithms undergo thorough testing and validation in approaching stationary points of representative non-convex variational models in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>A stochastic perturbation approach to nonlinear bifurcating problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating probabilistic terms in mathematical models is crucial for capturing and quantifying uncertainties in real-world systems. However, stochastic models typically require large computational resources to produce meaningful statistics. For this reason, the development of reduction techniques becomes essential for enabling efficient and scalable simulations of complex scenarios while quantifying the underlying uncertainties. In this work, we study the accuracy of Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate expansion of the probability space on a bifurcating phenomenon in fluid dynamics, namely the Coanda effect. In particular, we propose a novel non-deterministic approach to generic bifurcation detection problems, where the stochastic setting provides a different perspective on the non-uniqueness of the solution, also avoiding expensive simulations for many instances of the parameter. Thus, starting from the formulation of the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method (SSFEM), we extend the methodology to deal with solutions of a bifurcating problem, by working with a perturbed version of the deterministic model. We discuss the link between deterministic and stochastic bifurcation diagrams, highlighting the surprising capability of PC polynomial coefficients to give insights into the deterministic solution manifold.</description>

      <title>Distributions in spaces with thick submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a theory of distributions (generalized functions) with a ``thick submanifold'', that is, a new theory of thick distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose domain contains a smooth submanifold on which the test functions may be singular. We define several operations, including ``thick partial derivatives'', and clarify their connection with their classical counterparts in Schwartz distribution theory. We also introduce and study a number of special thick distributions, including new thick delta functions, or more generally thick multilayer distributions along a submanifold.</description>

      <title>Orbifold singularity formation along ancient and immortal Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In stark contrast to lower dimensions, we produce a plethora of ancient and immortal Ricci flows in real dimension $4$ with Einstein orbifolds as tangent flows at infinity. For instance, for any $k\in\mathbb{N}_0$, we obtain continuous families of non-isometric ancient Ricci flows on $\#k(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2)$ depending on a number of parameters growing linearly in $k$, and a family of half-PIC ancient Ricci flows on $\mathbb{CP}^2\#\mathbb{CP}^2$.
  The ancient/immortal dichotomy is determined by a notion of linear stability of orbifold singularities with respect to the expected way for them to appear along Ricci flow: by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics. We discuss the case of Ricci solitons orbifolds and motivate a conjecture that spherical and cylindrical solitons with orbifold singularities, which are unstable in our sense, should not appear along Ricci flow by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of the Dirichlet and Fucik spectra for the one-dimensional asymmetric p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the Dirichlet spectrum $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of the asymmetric $p$-Laplace operator $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on an interval $(0,L)$ where
  \[ \Delta^{a,b}_p u:= \left(a^{p}[(u')^{+}]^{p-1}-b^{p}[(u')^{-}]^{p-1}\right)'. \] We characterize completely the set $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ and the respective eigenfunctions in terms of the corresponding ones for the classical one-dimensional $p$-Laplace operator and establish that only the eigenfunctions associated to the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ have definite sign and, furthermore, its eigenspace is formed precisely by two non-collinear half-lines in $C^1[0,L]$ if and only if $a \neq b$. Our approach also allows to characterize the Fu\v c\'ik spectrum $\Sigma^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ from a disjoint enumerate union of hyperboles closely related to the classical counterpart and corresponding solutions. All results are novelty even for $p = 2$.</description>
