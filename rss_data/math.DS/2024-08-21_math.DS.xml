      <title>Geometric decomposition of planar vector fields with a limit cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling is a cornerstone of computational biology. While mechanistic models might describe the interactions of interest of a system, they are often difficult to study. On the other hand, abstract models might capture key features but remain disconnected from experimental manipulation. Geometric methods have been useful in connecting both approaches, although they have only been established for specific type of systems. Phenomena of biological relevance, such as limit cycles, are still difficult to study using conventional methods. In this paper, I explore an alternative description of planar dynamical systems and I present an algorithm to compute numerically the geometric structure of planar systems with a limit cycle.</description>

      <title>Non-sufficiency of smoothness in the gradient conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that for analytic cost functions, gradient flow trajectories have finite length and converge to a single critical point. The gradient conjecture of R. Thom states that, again for analytic cost functions, whenever the gradient flow trajectory converges, the limit of its unit secants exists. One might think that already the convergence of the gradient flow trajectory to a critical point is enough to ensure that the unit secants have a limit, but this does not hold in general - the gradient conjecture is to a certain extend sharp. We provide a counterexample in case of the missing analyticity assumption, that is a smooth (non-analytic) cost function $f$, where the limit of unit secants does not exist. In addition, $f$ satisfies even a strong geometric length-distance convergence property.</description>

      <title>Structure of optimal gradient flows bifurcations on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider structure of typical gradient flows bifurcations on closed surfaces with minimal number of singular points. There are two type of such bifurcations: saddle-node (SN) and saddle connections (SC). The structure of a bifurcation is determinated by codimension one flow in the moment of bifurcation. We use the chord diagrams to specify the flows up to topological trajectory equivivalence. A chord diagram with a marked arc is complete topological invariant of a SN-bifurcations and a chord diagram with T-insert -- of SC-bifurcations. We list all such diagrams for flows on norientable surfaces of genus at most 2 and nonorientable surfaces of genus at most 3. For each of diagram we found inverse one that correspond the inverse flow.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency Removal of Reduced Bases in Parametric Model Order Reduction by Matrix Interpolation using Adaptive Sampling and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric model order reduction by matrix interpolation allows for efficient prediction of the behavior of dynamic systems without requiring knowledge about the underlying parametric dependency. Within this approach, reduced models are first sampled and then made consistent with each other by transforming the underlying reduced bases. Finally, the transformed reduced operators can be interpolated to predict reduced models for queried parameter points. However, the accuracy of the predicted reduced model strongly depends on the similarity of the sampled reduced bases. If the local reduced bases change significantly over the parameter space, inconsistencies are introduced in the training data for the matrix interpolation. These strong changes in the reduced bases can occur due to the model order reduction method used, a change of the system's dynamics with a change of the parameters, and mode switching and truncation. In this paper, individual approaches for removing these inconsistencies are extended and combined into one general framework to simultaneously treat multiple sources of inconsistency. For that, modal truncation is used for the reduction, an adaptive sampling of the parameter space is performed, and eventually, the parameter space is partitioned into regions in which all local reduced bases are consistent with each other. The proposed framework is applied to a cantilever Timoshenko beam and the Kelvin cell for one- to three-dimensional parameter spaces. Compared to the original version of parametric model order reduction by matrix interpolation and an existing method for inconsistency removal, the proposed framework leads to parametric reduced models with significantly smaller errors.</description>

      <title>Disk patterns, quasi-duality and the uniform bounded diameter conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the diameter of the image of the skinning map on the deformation space of an acylindrical reflection group is bounded by a constant depending only on the topological complexity of the components of its boundary, answering a conjecture of Minsky in the reflection group setting. This result can be interpreted as a uniform rigidity theorem for disk patterns. Our method also establishes a connection between the diameter of the skinning image and certain discrete extremal width on the Coxeter graph of the reflection group.</description>

      <title>Competing Social Contagions with Opinion Dependent Infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation (maliciously spread false information) in online social networks has become an important problem in today's society. Disinformation's spread is facilitated by the fact that individuals often accept false information based on cognitive biases which predispose them to believe information that they have heard repeatedly or that aligns with their beliefs. Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a corresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model for two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have an internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their likelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations of an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study how the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial conditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the population. We find that the addition of cognitive biases enriches the transient dynamics of the spreading process, facilitating behavior such as the revival of a dying belief and the overturning of an initially widespread opinion. Finally, we study how external recruitment of spreaders can lead to the eventual dominance of one of the two beliefs.</description>

      <title>On the strong Feller property of the heat equation on quantum graphs with Kirchoff noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a so-called quantum graph with standard continuity and Kirchhoff vertex conditions where the Kirchhoff vertex condition is perturbed by Gaussian noise. We show that the quantum graph setting is very different from the classical one dimensional boundary noise setting, where the transition semigroup is known to be strong Feller, by giving examples and counterexamples to the strong Feller property. In particular, when the graph is a tree, and there is noise present in all but one of the terminal vertices, then the transition semigroup associated with the problem is strong Feller at any time $T&gt;0$. This turns out to be also a necessary condition for equilateral star graphs. We also comment on the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and the regularity of the solution.</description>

      <title>Genus zero transverse foliations for weakly convex Reeb flows on the tight $3$-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A contact form on the tight $3$-sphere $(S^3,\xi_0)$ is called weakly convex if the Conley-Zehnder index of every Reeb orbit is at least $2$. In this article, we study Reeb flows of weakly convex contact forms on $(S^3,\xi_0)$ admitting a prescribed finite set of index-$2$ Reeb orbits, which are all hyperbolic and mutually unlinked. We present conditions so that these index-$2$ orbits are binding orbits of a genus zero transverse foliation whose additional binding orbits have index $3$. In addition, we show in the real-analytic case that the topological entropy of the Reeb flow is positive if the branches of the stable/unstable manifolds of the index-$2$ orbits are mutually non-coincident.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation of degree $2$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ with dimension $k\geq 2$. We prove that either $\mathcal{F}$ is algebraically integrable, or $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-2 foliation by curves on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+1}$, or $\mathcal{F}$ is a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k +1},2)$, or $\mathcal{F}$ is a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+3})$, or $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-2 foliation of dimension 2 on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+2}$ tangent to an action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{C})$. As a byproduct, we describe the geometry of Poisson structures on $\mathbb{P}^n$ with generic rank two.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs), deep neural networks (DNNs) which replicate fixed point iterations for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm Integral Equations (FIE) of the second kind. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>
