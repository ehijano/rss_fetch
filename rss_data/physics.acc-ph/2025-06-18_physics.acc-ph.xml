      <title>Numerical investigations of heavy ion driven plasma wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-Based Acceleration (PBA) has emerged as a promising approach to achieve ultra-high gradient particle acceleration. While extensive PBA studies have been conducted using laser, electron, and proton drivers, significant challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, stable acceleration, and scalable energy gain. Meanwhile, due to their higher beam charge density, heavier particle mass and higher kinetic energy, heavy-ion beam drivers represent an interesting direction in PBA research. In this paper, the plasma wakefield acceleration driven by heavy ion beam is studied for the first time, aiming to find the best mechanism for generating high-amplitude wakefields. Using the high intensity, high energy heavy ion beams provided by the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF), our simulations show that heavy ions can excite stable, high-amplitude plasma wakefields up to 6 GV/m, suitable for electron acceleration. These results show good performance of heavy ion beam drivers and their potential as a viable and promising approach in the field of PBA.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Meta-Learning Framework for Anomaly Forecasting in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Physics-Inspired Simulation and Deep Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by nonstationary and stochastic behavior. The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.</description>

      <title>LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.
  The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\&amp;D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\&amp;D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.</description>
