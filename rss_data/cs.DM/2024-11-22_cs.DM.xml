      <title>A Hierarchical Poisson Generator for Universal Graphs under Limited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph generation is one of the most challenging tasks in recent years, and its core is to learn the ground truth distribution hiding in the training data. However, training data may not be available due to security concerns or unaffordable costs, which severely blows the learning models, especially the deep generative models. The dilemma leads us to rethink non-learned generation methods based on graph invariant features. Based on the observation of scale-free property, we propose a hierarchical Poisson graph generation algorithm. Specifically, we design a two-stage generation strategy. In the first stage, we sample multiple anchor nodes according to the Poisson distribution to further guide the formation of substructures, splitting the initial node set into multiple ones. Next, we progressively generate edges by sampling nodes through a degree mixing distribution, adjusting the tolerance towards exotic structures via two thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees for hierarchical generation and verify the effectiveness of our method under 12 datasets of three categories. Experimental results show that our method fits the ground truth distribution better than various generation strategies and other distribution observations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Transforming DAGs within the I-LCA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the connections between clusters and least common ancestors (LCAs) in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), focusing on DAGs with unique LCAs for specific subsets of their leaves. These DAGs are important in modeling phylogenetic networks that account for reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic DAGs inferred from genomic data are often complex, obscuring evolutionary insights, especially when vertices lack support as LCAs for any subset of taxa. To address this, we focus on $I$-lca-relevant DAGs, where each vertex serves as the unique LCA for a subset $A$ of leaves of specific size $|A|\in I$. We characterize DAGs with the so-called $I$-lca-property and establish their close relationship to pre-$I$-ary and $I$-ary set systems. Moreover, we build upon recently established results that use a simple operator $\ominus$, enabling the transformation of arbitrary DAGs into $I$-lca-relevant DAGs. This process reduces unnecessary complexity while preserving the key structural properties of the original DAG. The set $C_G$ consists of all clusters in a DAG $G$, where clusters correspond to the descendant leaves of vertices. While in some cases $C_H = C_G$ when transforming $G$ into an $I$-lca-relevant DAG $H$, it often happens that certain clusters in $C_G$ do not appear as clusters in $H$. To understand this phenomenon in detail, we characterize the subset of clusters in $C_G$ that remain in $H$ for DAGs $G$ with the $I$-lca-property. Furthermore, we show that the set $W$ of vertices required to transform $G$ into $H = G \ominus W$ is uniquely determined for such DAGs. This, in turn, allows us to show that the transformed DAG $H$ is always a tree or a galled-tree whenever $C_G$ represents the clustering system of a tree or galled-tree and $G$ has the $I$-lca-property. In the latter case $C_H = C_G$ always holds.</description>

      <title>Computing the permanental polynomial of $4k$-intercyclic bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$. The characteristic polynomial $\phi(G,x)=\det(xI-A(G))$ and the permanental polynomial $\pi(G,x) = \text{per}(xI-A(G))$ are both graph invariants used to distinguish graphs. For bipartite graphs, we define the modified characteristic polynomial, which is obtained by changing the signs of some of the coefficients of $\phi(G,x)$. For $4k$-intercyclic bipartite graphs, i.e., those for which the removal of any $4k$-cycle results in a $C_{4k}$-free graph, we provide an expression for $\pi(G,x)$ in terms of the modified characteristic polynomial of the graph and its subgraphs. Our approach is purely combinatorial in contrast to the Pfaffian orientation method found in the literature to compute the permanental polynomial.</description>
