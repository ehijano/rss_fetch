      <title>Computability of Pressure for Subshifts on Countable Amenable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are a variety of results in the literature proving forms of computability for topological entropy and pressure on subshifts. In this work, we prove two quite general results, showing that topological pressure is always computable from above given an enumeration for a forbidden list inducing the subshift, and that for strongly irreducible shifts of finite type, topological pressure is computable. Our results apply to subshifts on all finitely generated amenable groups with decidable word problem and generalize several previous results which applied only to $\mathbb{Z}^d$-subshifts.
  As corollaries, we obtain some results related to ground state energy and entropy, proving that the map sending $\phi$ to $\sup_{\mu \in M_\sigma(X)} \int \phi d\mu$ is computable/computable from above when $P_X(\phi)$ is, and that the map sending $\phi$ to its ground state/residual entropy is computable from above when $P_X(\phi)$ is computable.
  We conclude by giving explicit bounds on computation time of $P_X(\phi)$ in the $\mathbb{Z}^d$ setting for SI SFTs and locally constant and rational valued $\phi$, and show that in the special case $X = A^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$, this algorithm runs in singly exponential time.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The border-collision normal form is a piecewise-linear family of continuous maps that describe the dynamics near border-collision bifurcations. Most prior studies assume each piece of the normal form is invertible, as is generic from an abstract viewpoint, but in applied problems one piece of the map often has degenerate range, corresponding to a zero determinant. This provides simplification, yet even in two dimensions the dynamics can be incredibly rich. The purpose of this paper is to determine broadly how the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant differs for different values of its parameters. We identify parameter regions of period-adding, period-incrementing, mode-locking, and component doubling of chaotic attractors, and characterise the dominant bifurcation boundaries. The intention is for the results to enable border-collision bifurcations in mathematical models to be analysed more easily and effectively, and we illustrate this with a flu epidemic model and two stick-slip friction oscillator models. We also describe three novel bifurcation structures that remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anaerobic digestion model with two serial interconnected chemostats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a well known two-step anaerobic digestion model in a configuration of two chemostats in series. This model is an eight-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. Since the reaction system has a cascade structure, we show that the eight-order model can be reduced to a four-dimensional one. Using general growth rates, we provide an in-depth mathematical analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the system. First, we determine all the steady states of the model where there can be more than fifteen equilibria with a non-monotonic growth rate. Then, the necessary and sufficient conditions of existence and local stability of all steady states are established according to the operating parameters: the dilution rate, the input concentrations of the two nutrients, and the distribution of the total process volume considered. The operating diagrams are then analyzed theoretically to describe the asymptotic behavior of the process according to the four control parameters. There can be seventy regions with rich behavior where the system may exhibit bistability or tristability with the coexistence of both microbial species in the two bioreactors.</description>

      <title>On the amenability of semigroups of entire maps and formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some relations between dynamical and algebraic properties of semigroups of entire maps with applications to semigroups of formal series. We show that two entire maps fixing the origin share the set of preperiodic points, whenever these maps generate a semigroup which contains neither free nor free abelian non-cyclic subsemigroups and one of the maps has the origin as a superattracting fixed point. We show that a subgroup of formal series generated by rational elements is amenable, whenever contains no free non-cyclic subsemigroup generated by rational elements. We prove that a left-amenable semigroup S of entire maps admits a invariant probability measure for a continuous extension of S on the Stone-Cech compactification of the complex plane. Finally, given an entire map f, we associate a semigroup S such that f admits no ergodic fixed point of the Ruelle operator, whenever every finitely generated subsemigroup of S admits a left-amenable Ruelle representation.</description>

      <title>Modelling parametric uncertainty in PDEs models via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an approach enabling one to employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for uncertainty quantification. Our approach is applicable to systems where observations are scarce (or even lacking), these being typical situations associated with subsurface water bodies. Our novel physics-informed neural network under uncertainty (PINN-UU) integrates the space-time domain across which processes take place and uncertain parameter spaces within a unique computational domain. PINN-UU is then trained to satisfy the relevant physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) in the defined input domain. We employ a stage training approach via transfer learning to accommodate high-dimensional solution spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-UU in a scenario associated with reactive transport in porous media, showcasing its reliability, efficiency, and applicability to sensitivity analysis. PINN-UU emerges as a promising tool for robust uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to groundwater systems. As such, it can be considered as a valuable alternative to traditional methods such as multi-realization Monte Carlo simulations based on direct solvers or black-box surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Impact of directionality on the emergence of Turing patterns on m-directed higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hereby develop the theory of Turing instability for reaction-diffusion systems defined on m-directed hypergraphs, the latter being generalization of hypergraphs where nodes forming hyperedges can be shared into two disjoint sets, the head nodes and the tail nodes. This framework encodes thus for a privileged direction for the reaction to occur: the joint action of tail nodes is a driver for the reaction involving head nodes. It thus results a natural generalization of directed networks. Based on a linear stability analysis we have shown the existence of two Laplace matrices, allowing to analytically prove that Turing patterns, stationary or wave-like, emerges for a much broader set of parameters in the m-directed setting. In particular directionality promotes Turing instability, otherwise absent in the symmetric case. Analytical results are compared to simulations performed by using the Brusselator model defined on a m-directed d-hyperring as well as on a m-directed random hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of polynomials defining parabolic parameters of period 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morton and Vivaldi defined the polynomials whose roots are parabolic parameters for a one-parameter family of polynomial maps. We call these polynomials delta factors. They conjectured that delta factors are irreducible for the family $z\mapsto z^2+c$. One can easily show the irreducibility for periods $1$ and $2$ by reducing it to the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. However, for periods $3$ and beyond, this becomes a challenging problem. This paper proves the irreducibility of delta factors for the period $3$ and demonstrates the existence of infinitely many irreducible delta factors for periods greater than $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify singular holomorphic vector fields in two-dimensional complex space admitting a (Levi-nonflat) real-analytic invariant 3-fold through the singularity. In this way, we complete the classification of infinitesimal symmetries of real-analytic Levi-nonflat hypersurfaces in complex two-space. The classification of holomorphic vector fields obtained in the paper has very interesting overlaps with the recent Lombardi-Stolovitch classification theory for holomorphic vector fields at a singularity. In particular, we show that most of the resonances arising in Lombardi-Stolovitch theory do not occur under the presence of (Levi-nonflat) integral manifolds.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evader Detection in Mobile Sensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose one wants to monitor a domain with sensors, each sensing a small ball-shaped region, but the domain is hazardous enough that one cannot control the placement of the sensors. A prohibitively large number of randomly placed sensors could be required to obtain static coverage. Instead, one can use fewer sensors by providing mobile coverage, a generalization of the static setup wherein every possible evader is detected by the moving sensors in a bounded amount of time. Here, we use topology in order to implement algorithms certifying mobile coverage that use only local data to solve the global problem. Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the sensors' locations, only their connectivity information. We experimentally study the statistics of mobile coverage in two dynamical scenarios. We allow the sensors to move independently (billiard dynamics and Brownian motion), or to locally coordinate their dynamics (collective animal motion models). Our detailed simulations show, for example, that collective motion can enhance performance: The expected time until the mobile sensor network achieves mobile coverage is lower for the D'Orsogna collective motion model than for the billiard motion model. Further, we show that even when the probability of static coverage is low, all possible evaders can nevertheless be detected relatively quickly by the mobile sensor network.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable discrete group. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a transitive $G$-system to be disjoint with all minimal $G$-systems, which implies that if a transitive $G$-system is disjoint with all minimal $G$-systems, then it is $\infty$-transitive, i.e. $(X^k,G)$ is transitive for all $k\in\N$, and has dense minimal points. In addition, we show that any $\infty$-transitive $G$-system with dense distal points are disjoint with all minimal $G$-systems.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of stability for smooth Blaschke product cocycles fixing the origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the stability properties of Lyapunov exponents of transfer operator cocycles from a measure-theoretic perspective. Our results focus on so-called Blaschke product cocycles, a class of random dynamical systems amenable to rigorous analysis. We show that prevalence of stability is related to the dimension of the base system's domain, $\Omega$. When $\Omega=S^1$, we show that stability is prevalent among smooth monic quadratic Blaschke product cocycles fixing the origin by constructing a so-called probe. For higher dimensional $\Omega$, we show that a probe does not exist, thus providing strong evidence that stability is not prevalent in this setting. Finally, through a perturbative method we show that almost every smooth Blaschke product cocycle fixing the origin is stable.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations characterized by uncertainty are effective in modelling virus dynamics and provide an alternative to traditional deterministic models. Epidemic models are inevitably subjected to the randomness within the system or the environmental noise. In this paper, we analyze the stochastic within host compartment model for SARS-CoV-2 virus and explore its dynamics. We first examine the existence and positivity of the solution of the model using Ito's formula and the establish the stochastic boundedness and permanence of the model. Exponential stability of the infection free equilibrium state is established. Numerical simulations are conducted to complement the theoretical results. Environmental noise is found to play a crucial role in the dynamics of the disease and can even lead to the extinction of the disease. The model is also extended to a stochastic optimal control problem and the effectiveness of control measures, such as antiviral drugs and immunomodulators is investigated.</description>

These examples answer two questions of Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob. We analyze the oscillating example in terms of random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, using the Chung-Fuchs theorem.</description>

      <title>A master-slave coupling scheme for synchronization and parameter estimation in the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the constant parameters of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation from observed data has received attention from researchers in physics, applied mathematics and statistics. This is motivated by the various physical applications of the equation and, also, because it often serves as a test model for the study of space-time pattern formation. Remarkably, most existing inference techniques rely on statistical tools, which are computationally very costly yet do not exploit the dynamical features of the system. In this paper we introduce a simple, online parameter estimation method that relies on the synchronization properties of the KS equation. In particular, we describe a master-slave setup where the slave model is driven by observations from the master system. The slave dynamics are data-driven and designed to continuously adapt the model parameters until identical synchronization with the master system is achieved. We provide a simple analysis that supports the proposed approach and also present and discuss the results of an extensive set of computer simulations. Our numerical study shows that the proposed method is computationally fast and also robust to initialization errors, observational noise and variations in the spatial resolution of the numerical scheme used to integrate the KS equation.</description>
