      <title>A Perspective on the Algebra, Topology, and Logic of Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified algebraic, topological, and logical framework for electrical one-port networks based on \v{S}are's $m$-theory. Within this formalism, networks are represented by $m$-words (jorbs) over an ordered alphabet, where series and parallel composition induce an $m$-topology on $m$-graphs with a theta mapping $\vartheta$ that preserves one-port equivalence. The study formalizes quasi-orders, shells, and cores, showing their structural correspondence to network boundary conditions and impedance behavior. The $\lambda--\Delta$ metric, together with the valuation morphism $\Phi$, provides a concise descriptor of the impedance-degree structure. In the computational domain, the framework is extended with algorithmic procedures for generating and classifying non-isomorphic series-parallel topologies, accompanied by programmatic Cauer/Foster synthesis workflows and validation against canonical examples from Ladenheim's catalogue. The resulting approach enables symbolic-to-topological translation of impedance functions, offering a constructive bridge between algebraic representation and electrical realization. Overall, the paper outlines a self-consistent theoretical and computational foundation for automated network synthesis, classification, and formal verification within the emerging field of Jorbology.</description>

      <title>Pricing Problems in Adoption of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Bass diffusion model in discrete-time that explicitly models the effect of price in adoption. Our model is different from earlier price-incorporated models and fits well to adoption data for various products. We then utilize this model to study two decision-making problems. First, we provide a series of structural results on optimal pricing strategies to maximize profits from product sales by a monopolist over a finite horizon. We fully characterize the optimal pricing strategy in the single-period problem, and establish several structural properties of the same for the multi-period counterpart. Second, we study a Stackelberg game between a policy-maker and a monopolist, where the former seeks to maximize adoption through rebates, while the latter focuses on profits. For this problem, we analytically characterize crucial properties of the equilibrium path of the single-period game, and demonstrate how they carry over to the multi-period variant.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning with Precedence Specifications via Augmented Graphs of Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for planning trajectories that avoid obstacles and satisfy key-door precedence specifications expressed with a fragment of signal temporal logic. Our method includes a novel exact convex partitioning of the obstacle free space that encodes connectivity among convex free space sets, key sets, and door sets. We then construct an augmented graph of convex sets that exactly encodes the key-door precedence specifications. By solving a shortest path problem in this augmented graph of convex sets, our pipeline provides an exact solution up to a finite parameterization of the trajectory. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a method to generate key-door mazes that provide challenging problem instances, and we perform numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed pipeline. Our pipeline is faster by several orders of magnitude than recent state-of-the art methods that use general purpose temporal logic tools.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid GNN-LSE Method for Fast, Robust, and Physically-Consistent AC Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust, iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR. The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution, while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for real-time operations and analysis.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Rotor Cooling with Ducted Liquid in Completely Cold-Formed Modular Motor Shaft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper suggests a novel rotor-cooling shaft concept for high-performance electric motors that increases the effectiveness of cooling and is yet simple and cost-effective to manufacture. We investigate the thermal performance of four shaft geometries for rotor cooling in automotive applications. The proposed tooth-guided liquid-cooling shaft design aims to solve the high churning loss of conventional cooled rotor shafts due to internal vortex formation and their still limited heat transfer. Therefore, we optimize heat transfer efficiency and pressure management by incorporating cold-formed internal channels that restrict vortex formation beyond a degree that improves heat transfer. We evaluated key performance metrics, including heat transfer rate, outlet temperature, pressure drop, and velocity profiles, under varying rotational speeds, inlet flow rates, and coolant temperatures. Computational fluid analysis demonstrates that the tooth-guided design outperforms conventional hollow shafts and achieves up to 110% higher cooling efficiency at low rotational speeds, while it maintains comparable pressure levels. These findings provide practical insight into geometry-driven thermal optimization and offer a path toward improving the performance and durability of electric motors.</description>

      <title>TRASE-NODEs: Trajectory Sensitivity-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Efficient Dynamic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems is crucial across the science and engineering fields for accurate prediction, control, and decision-making. Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, particularly neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), have emerged as a powerful tool for data-driven modeling of continuous-time dynamics. Nevertheless, standard NODEs require a large number of data samples to remain consistent under varying control inputs, posing challenges to generate sufficient simulated data and ensure the safety of control design. To address this gap, we propose trajectory-sensitivity-aware (TRASE-)NODEs, which construct an augmented system for both state and sensitivity, enabling simultaneous learning of their dynamics. This formulation allows the adjoint method to update gradients in a memory-efficient manner and ensures that control-input effects are captured in the learned dynamics. We evaluate TRASE-NODEs using damped oscillator and inverter-based resources (IBRs). The results show that TRASE-NODEs generalize better from the limited training data, yielding lower prediction errors than standard NODEs for both examples. The proposed framework offers a data-efficient, control-oriented modeling approach suitable for dynamic systems that require accurate trajectory sensitivity prediction.</description>

      <title>Fair Cost Allocation in Energy Communities: A DLMP-based Bilevel Optimization with a Shapley Value Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) are emerging as a promising decentralized model for managing cooperative distributed energy resources (DERs). As these communities expand and their operations become increasingly integrated into the grid, ensuring fairness in allocating operating costs among participants becomes a challenge. In distribution networks, DER operations at the community level can influence Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs), which in turn affect system's operation cost. This interdependence between local decisions and system-level pricing introduces new challenges for fair and transparent cost allocation. Despite growing interest in fairness-aware methods, most methods do not account for the impact of DLMPs. To fill this gap, we propose a bilevel optimization model in which a Community Energy Aggregator (CEA) schedules DERs across multiple ECs while a Distribution System Operator (DSO) determines DLMPs through network-constrained dispatch. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and strong duality, the bilevel model is reformulated into a tractable single-level problem. We achieve fairness in the cost allocation by applying the Shapley value to quantify each community's marginal contribution to system-wide cost savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations on several benchmark distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Power System Stability Enhancement with Dissipativity-Based Neural Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of converter-interfaced generation introduces new transient stability challenges to modern power systems. Classical Lyapunov- and scalable passivity-based approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions, and finding storage functions for large grids is generally considered intractable. Furthermore, most methods require an accurate grid dynamics model. To address these challenges, we propose a model-free, nonlinear, and dissipativity-based controller which, when applied to grid-connected virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), enhances power system transient stability. Using input-state data, we train neural networks to learn dissipativity-characterizing matrices that yield stabilizing controllers. Furthermore, we incorporate cost function shaping to improve the performance with respect to the user-specified objectives. Numerical results on a modified, all-VSG Kundur two-area power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Vector-Valued Native Space Embedding for Adaptive State Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper combines vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS) embedding with robust adaptive observation, yielding an algorithm that is both non-parametric and robust. The main contribution of this paper lies in the ability of the proposed system to estimate the state of a plan model whose matched uncertainties are elements of an infinite-dimensional native space. The plant model considered in this paper also suffers from unmatched uncertainties. Finally, the measured output is affected by disturbances as well. Upper bounds on the state observation error are provided in an analytical form. The proposed theoretical results are applied to the problem of estimating the state of a rigid body.</description>

      <title>Resilient Composite Control for Stability Enhancement in EV Integrated DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When electric vehicles (EVs) are integrated into standalone DC microgrids (DCMGs), stability issues arise due to their constant power load (CPL) behavior, which provides negative incremental impedance (NII). In addition, the microgrids suffer from an inherent low-inertia problem. Therefore, this study presents a composite controller incorporating a global integral terminal sliding mode controller with a backstepping controller. A virtual capacitor is employed to mitigate the low-inertia issue and strengthen the DC-bus response. An improved fractional power-based reaching law decreases chattering and accelerates convergence. Exact feedback linearization converts the nonlinear boost converter model into Brunovsky's canonical form, mitigating NII effects and non-minimum phase issues. The entire system stability is verified using Lyapunov control theory. Simulation outcomes confirm superior performance, with 34.4-53.3% reduction in overshoot, 52.9-74.9% in undershoot, and 12-47.4% in settling time compared to the existing controller.</description>

      <title>A Scenario-based Stochastic Model of using BESS-based Virtual Transmission Lines in Day-Ahead Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in renewable energy sources (RES) implementation in the power system creates more severe network congestion, which may reduce grid operation efficiency and cause renewable curtailment. Deterministic optimization for the unit commitment shows that battery energy storage system (BESS)-based Virtual Transmission Line (VTL), as an alternative to physical transmission lines, can offer a quick solution for congestion relief, reduced operational costs, and lowered renewable curtailment. This paper aims to evaluate the benefits of VTL when considering Renewable Energy Sources uncertainty. Particularly, this work proposes a scenario-based stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model considering VTL, referred to as SSCUC-VTL. It incorporates the forecast error of RES into the commitment decision for systems with VTL. The performance of applying the VTL strategy is compared to that of adding a new physical transmission line and a standalone BESS. A case study has been conducted on an enhanced IEEE 24-bus test system. The simulation results demonstrate that VTL provides 23% more operational cost reduction than the physical transmission line, and up to 67% more congestion relief than the standalone BESS in a power system with solar and wind generation.</description>

      <title>Functional Uncertainty Classes, Nonparametric Adaptive Contro Functional Uncertainty Classes for Nonparametric Adaptive Control: the Curse of Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives a new class of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vRKHS) defined in terms of operator-valued kernels for the representation of functional uncertainty arising in nonparametric adaptive control methods. These are referred to as maneuver or trajectory vRKHS KM in the paper, and they are introduced to address the curse of dimensionality that can arise for some types of nonparametric adaptive control strategies. The maneuver vRKHSs are derived based on the structure of a compact, l-dimensional, smooth Riemannian manifold M that is regularly embedded in the state space X = Rn, where M is assumed to approximately support the ultimate dynamics of the reference system to be tracked.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Agent Safety via Tube-Based Tightened Exponential Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances. The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form, accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF) constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Approximate Gradient Coding for Distributed Learning with Heterogeneous Stragglers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an optimally structured gradient coding scheme to mitigate the straggler problem in distributed learning. Conventional gradient coding methods often assume homogeneous straggler models or rely on excessive data replication, limiting performance in real-world heterogeneous systems. To address these limitations, we formulate an optimization problem minimizing residual error while ensuring unbiased gradient estimation by explicitly considering individual straggler probabilities. We derive closed-form solutions for optimal encoding and decoding coefficients via Lagrangian duality and convex optimization, and propose data allocation strategies that reduce both redundancy and computation load. We also analyze convergence behavior for $\lambda$-strongly convex and $\mu$-smooth loss functions. Numerical results show that our approach significantly reduces the impact of stragglers and accelerates convergence compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal Set-Theoretic Design of Robust Safety Filters for Constrained Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an ellipsoidal set-theoretic framework for robust safety filter synthesis in constrained linear systems subject to additive bounded disturbances and input constraints. We formulate the safety filter design as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem that simultaneously computes a robust controlled invariant (RCI) ellipsoidal set and its associated state-feedback control law. The RCI set is characterized as an ellipsoidal set, enabling computational tractability for high-dimensional systems while providing formal safety guarantees. The safety filter employs a smooth mixing strategy between nominal and backup controllers based on distance to the invariant set boundary, facilitating minimal intervention when the system operates safely. The proposed method extends to nonlinear systems by treating nonlinear terms as bounded disturbances with rigorous approximation bounds. Numerical validation on a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor system demonstrates the filter's effectiveness in maintaining stability under external disturbances and aggressive maneuvers while preserving nominal performance during safe operation. The approach provides a constructive and computationally efficient solution for safety-critical control applications requiring real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Residual Bias Compensation Filter for Physics-Based SOC Estimation in Lithium Iron Phosphate Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses state of charge (SOC) estimation for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, where the relatively flat open-circuit voltage (OCV-SOC) characteristic reduces observability. A residual bias compensation dual extended Kalman filter (RBC-DEKF) is developed. Unlike conventional bias compensation methods that treat the bias as an augmented state within a single filter, the proposed dual-filter structure decouples residual bias estimation from electrochemical state estimation. One EKF estimates the system states of a control-oriented parameter-grouped single particle model with thermal effects, while the other EKF estimates a residual bias that continuously corrects the voltage observation equation, thereby refining the model-predicted voltage in real time. Unlike bias-augmented single-filter schemes that enlarge the covariance coupling, the decoupled bias estimator refines the voltage observation without perturbing electrochemical state dynamics. Validation is conducted on an LFP cell from a public dataset under three representative operating conditions: US06 at 0 degC, DST at 25 degC, and FUDS at 50 degC. Compared with a conventional EKF using the same model and identical state filter settings, the proposed method reduces the average SOC RMSE from 3.75% to 0.20% and the voltage RMSE between the filtered model voltage and the measured voltage from 32.8 mV to 0.8 mV. The improvement is most evident in the mid-SOC range where the OCV-SOC curve is flat, confirming that residual bias compensation significantly enhances accuracy for model-based SOC estimation of LFP batteries across a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>Transmission Neural Networks: Approximate Receding Horizon Control for Virus Spread on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission Neural Networks (TransNNs) pro- posed by Gao and Caines (2022) serve as both virus spread models over networks and neural network models with tuneable activation functions. This paper establishes that TransNNs provide upper bounds on the infection probability generated from the associated Markovian stochastic Susceptible-Infected- Susceptible (SIS) model with 2^n state configurations where n is the number of nodes in the network, and can be employed as an approximate model for the latter. Based on such an approximation, a TransNN-based receding horizon control approach for mitigating virus spread is proposed and we demonstrate that it allows significant computational savings compared to the dynamic programming solution to Markovian SIS model with 2^n state configurations, as well as providing less conservative control actions compared to the TransNN- based optimal control. Finally, numerical comparisons among (a) dynamic programming solutions for the Markovian SIS model, (b) TransNN-based optimal control and (c) the proposed TransNN-based receding horizon control are presented.</description>

      <title>NeuroDOB: A Deep Neural Observer-Based Controller for Vehicle Lateral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes NeuroDOB, a deep neural network based observer controller for vehicle lateral dynamics, which replaces the conventional disturbance observer (DOB) with a deep neural network (DNN) to enhance personalized lateral control. Unlike conventional DOBs that compensate for general disturbances such as road friction variation and crosswind, NeuroDOB explicitly addresses unmodeled vehicle dynamics and driver-specific behaviors by learning the steering compensation signal from driver-in-the-loop simulations using CarSim's embedded controller as a surrogate driver. The proposed architecture integrates NeuroDOB with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the DNN outputs a delta error correction added to the baseline LQR steering input to produce the final control command. Input features to the DNN include lateral position and yaw angle errors, and the LQR control input. Experimental validation using a lateral dynamic bicycle model within CarSim demonstrates that NeuroDOB effectively adapts to individual driving habits, improving lateral control performance beyond what conventional LQR controllers achieve. The results indicate the potential of deep neural network based observer to enable personalized and adaptive autonomous vehicle control. In cognitive terms, the proposed architecture can be viewed as a dual-system control structure. The baseline LQR corresponds to System 1, a model-based, fast, and analytic reasoning layer ensuring stability. The NeuroDOB acts as System 2, a reflective, data-driven layer that learns compensation from experience and corrects the analytical bias of System 1. Together, they form an integrated decision process analogous to human intuition-reflection interaction, enabling both stability and adaptability in lateral control.</description>

      <title>Context-awareness for Dependable Low-Power IoT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependability is the ability to consistently deliver trusted and uninterrupted service in the face of operational uncertainties. Ensuring dependable operation in large-scale, energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is as crucial as challenging, and calls for context-aware protocols where context refers to situational or state information. In this paper, we identify four critical context dimensions for IoT networks, namely energy status, information freshness, task relevance, and physical/medium conditions, and show how each one underpins core dependability attributes. Building on these insights, we propose a two-step protocol design framework that incorporates operation-specific context fields. Through three representative use cases, we demonstrate how context awareness can significantly enhance system dependability while imposing only minimal control-plane overhead.</description>

      <title>Embroidery Actuator Utilizing Embroidery Patterns to Generate Diverse Fabric Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Embroidery Actuator, a fabric-integrated pneumatic actuator that enables diverse and controllable deformations through embroidery pattern design. Unlike conventional fabric actuators that rely on fiber- or thread-shaped actuators, the proposed actuator is fabricated by directly stitching an inflatable tube onto the fabric using a cord-embroidery technique. The embroidered thread and the fabric jointly form a sleeve that constrains the expansion of the inflatable tube, converting internal pressure into targeted bending or stretching deformations. By varying the embroidery pattern, such as zigzag or cross configurations, different geometric constraints can be realized, allowing for flexible control of deformation direction and magnitude. Analytical deformation models based on the Neo-Hookean model and Lagrange's equations were developed to predict the relationship between pneumatic pressure and bending angle, and were experimentally validated using motion-capture measurements. The results demonstrated that the actuator achieves strong agreement with the analytical deformation model.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow: Improving Worst-Case Guarantees during Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is central to power system operation but challenging to solve efficiently due to its nonconvex and nonlinear nature. Neural networks (NNs) offer fast surrogates, yet their black-box behavior raises concerns about constraint violations that can compromise safety. We propose a verification-informed NN framework that incorporates worst-case constraint violations directly into training, producing models that are both accurate and provably safer. Through post-hoc verification, we achieve substantial reductions in worst-case violations and, for the first time, verify all operational constraints of large-scale AC-OPF proxies. Practical feasibility is further enhanced via restoration and warm-start strategies for infeasible operating points. Experiments on systems ranging from 57 to 793 buses demonstrate scalability, speed, and reliability, bridging the gap between ML acceleration and safe, real-time deployment of AC-OPF solutions - and paving the way toward data-driven optimal control.</description>

      <title>Inertia Partitioning Modular Control Framework for Reconfigurable Multibody Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel modular control framework for reconfigurable rigid multibody systems is proposed, motivated by the challenges of modular control of systems with closed kinematic chains. In the framework, modularity is defined in the sense of degrees of freedom, and the inertial properties of each body are partitioned with respect to how they are reflected in the kinetic energy of the system through the motion induced by each degree of freedom. This approach inherently handles closed chains in the same manner as tree-like structures, eliminating the need for explicit constraint force calculations or formulations based on differential-algebraic equations. The proposed framework is implemented via simulation on a three-degree-of-freedom series-parallel manipulator, with the results being consistent with the expected stability and tracking performance, and indicating the framework's potential for scalability in trajectory-tracking control of multibody systems.</description>

      <title>Payload trajectory tracking control for aerial transportation systems with cable length online optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cable-suspended aerial transportation systems are employed extensively across various industries. The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor, the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design. This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition. Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter monitoring and control systems are crucial in the industry as they enable automation processes that improve productivity and resource optimization. These improvements also help to manage environmental factors and the complex interactions between multiple inputs and outputs required for production management. This paper proposes an automation system for broiler management based on a simulation scenario that involves sensor networks and embedded systems. The aim is to create a transmission network for monitoring and controlling broiler temperature and feeding using the Internet of Things (IoT), complemented by a dashboard and a cloud-based service database to track improvements in broiler management. We look forward this work will serve as a guide for stakeholders and entrepreneurs in the animal production industry, fostering sustainable development through simple and cost-effective automation solutions. The goal is for them to scale and integrate these recommendations into their existing operations, leading to more efficient decision-making at the management level.</description>

      <title>An Error-Based Safety Buffer for Safe Adaptive Control (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Towards Stochastic (N-1)-Secure Redispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an (N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.</description>

      <title>Force-Displacement Profiling for Robot-Assisted Deployment of a Left Atrial Appendage Occluder Using FBG-EM Distal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder. Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces, suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback, improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic environments.</description>

      <title>A phase-aware AI car-following model for electric vehicles with adaptive cruise control: Development and validation using real-world data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking. Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains challenging.
  To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI (PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in traffic simulations.</description>

      <title>Learn2Drive: A neural network-based framework for socially compliant automated vehicle control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control (ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption. Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions, thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99% increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39% improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in traffic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones, while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii) Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales: multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.</description>

      <title>Automated Tinnitus Detection Through Dual-Modality Neuroimaging: EEG Microstate Analysis and Resting-State fMRI Classification Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from 80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38 participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands, producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus, particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs tinnitus: 43.81, p &lt; 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based classifiers achieved up to 98.8% accuracy, while VGG16 on wavelet-transformed EEG yielded 95.4% and 94.1% accuracy for delta and alpha bands, respectively. fMRI analysis identified 12 high-performing axial slices (&gt;=90% accuracy), with slice 17 reaching 99.0%. The hybrid VGG16-Decision Tree model achieved 98.95% +/- 2.94% accuracy. Conclusion: EEG and fMRI provided effective neural biomarkers for tinnitus classification. Tree-based and hybrid models demonstrated superior performance, highlighting tinnitus as a multi-network disorder requiring multimodal analysis.</description>

      <title>Fixed Horizon Linear Quadratic Covariance Steering in Continuous Time with Hilbert-Schmidt Terminal Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and solve the fixed horizon linear quadratic covariance steering problem in continuous time with a terminal cost measured in Hilbert-Schmidt (i.e., Frobenius) norm error between the desired and the controlled terminal covariances. For this problem, the necessary conditions of optimality become a coupled matrix ODE two-point boundary value problem. To solve this system of equations, we design a matricial recursive algorithm and prove its convergence. The proposed algorithm and its analysis make use of the linear fractional transforms parameterized by the state transition matrix of the associated Hamiltonian matrix. To illustrate the results, we provide two numerical examples: one with a two dimensional and another with a six dimensional state space.</description>

      <title>Control of neural field equations with step-function inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and neurostimulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper extends core results of behavioral systems theory from linear to affine time-invariant systems. We characterize the behavior of affine time-invariant systems via kernel, input-output, state-space, and finite-horizon data-driven representations, demonstrating a range of structural parallels with linear time-invariant systems. Building on these representations, we introduce a new persistence of excitation condition tailored to the model class of affine time-invariant systems. The condition yields a new fundamental lemma that parallels the classical result for linear systems while provably reducing data requirements. Our analysis highlights that excitation conditions must be adapted to the model class: overlooking structural differences may lead to unnecessarily conservative data requirements.</description>

      <title>Taming Silent Failures: A Framework for Verifiable AI Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into safety-critical systems introduces a new reliability paradigm: silent failures, where AI produces confident but incorrect outputs that can be dangerous. This paper introduces the Formal Assurance and Monitoring Environment (FAME), a novel framework that confronts this challenge. FAME synergizes the mathematical rigor of offline formal synthesis with the vigilance of online runtime monitoring to create a verifiable safety net around opaque AI components. We demonstrate its efficacy in an autonomous vehicle perception system, where FAME successfully detected 93.5% of critical safety violations that were otherwise silent. By contextualizing our framework within the ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 8800 standards, we provide reliability engineers with a practical, certifiable pathway for deploying trustworthy AI. FAME represents a crucial shift from accepting probabilistic performance to enforcing provable safety in next-generation systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Proximal Algorithm on Riemannian Submanifolds for Weakly-convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the distributed stochastic optimization problems on compact embedded submanifolds (in the Euclidean space) for multi-agent network systems. To address the manifold structure, we propose a distributed Riemannian stochastic proximal algorithm framework by utilizing the retraction and Riemannian consensus protocol, and analyze three specific algorithms: the distributed Riemannian stochastic subgradient, proximal point, and prox-linear algorithms. When the local costs are weakly-convex and the initial points satisfy certain conditions, we show that the iterates generated by this framework converge to a nearly stationary point in expectation while achieving consensus. We further establish the convergence rate of the algorithm framework as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1+\kappa_g}{\sqrt{k}})$ where $k$ denotes the number of iterations and $\kappa_g$ shows the impact of manifold geometry on the algorithm performance. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the theoretical results and show the empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Adapting Noise-Driven PUF and AI for Secure WBG ICS: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-bandgap (WBG) technologies offer unprecedented improvements in power system efficiency, size, and performance, but also introduce unique sensor corruption and cybersecurity risks in industrial control systems (ICS), particularly due to high-frequency noise and sophisticated cyber-physical threats. This proof-of-concept (PoC) study demonstrates the adaptation of a noise-driven physically unclonable function (PUF) and machine learning (ML)-assisted anomaly detection framework to the demanding environment of WBG-based ICS sensor pathways. By extracting entropy from unavoidable WBG switching noise (up to 100 kHz) as a PUF source, and simultaneously using this noise as a real-time threat indicator, the proposed system unites hardware-level authentication and anomaly detection. Our approach integrates hybrid machine learning (ML) models with adaptive Bayesian filtering, providing robust and low-latency detection capabilities resilient to both natural electromagnetic interference (EMI) and active adversarial manipulation. Through detailed simulations of WBG modules under benign and attack scenarios--including EMI injection, signal tampering, and node impersonation--we achieve 95% detection accuracy and sub-millisecond processing latency. These results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-driven, dual-use noise exploitation as a scalable ICS defense primitive. Our findings lay the groundwork for next-generation security strategies that leverage inherent device characteristics, bridging hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced protection of critical ICS infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Politics, Inequality, and the Robustness of Shared Infrastructure Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our infrastructure systems enable our well-being by allowing us to move, store, and transform materials and information given considerable social and environmental variation. Critically, this ability is shaped by the degree to which society invests in infrastructure, a fundamentally political question in large public systems. There, infrastructure providers are distinguished from users through political processes, such as elections, and there is considerable heterogeneity among users. Previous political economic models have not taken into account (i) dynamic infrastructures, (ii) dynamic user preferences, and (iii) alternatives to rational actor theory. Meanwhile, engineering often neglects politics. We address these gaps with a general dynamic model of shared infrastructure systems that incorporates theories from political economy, social-ecological systems, and political psychology. We use the model to develop propositions on how multiple characteristics of the political process impact the robustness of shared infrastructure systems to capacity shocks and unequal opportunity for private infrastructure investment. Under user fees, inequality decreases robustness, but taxing private infrastructure use can increase robustness if non-elites have equal political influence. Election cycle periods have a nonlinear effect where increasing them increases robustness up to a point but decreases robustness beyond that point. Further, there is a negative relationship between the ideological sensitivity of candidates and robustness. Overall, the biases of voters and candidates (whether they favor tax increases or decreases) mediate these political-economic effects on robustness because biases may or may not match the reality of system needs (whether system recovery requires tax increases).</description>

      <title>A Novel Multi-Timescale Stability-Preserving Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Controller Framework for Adaptive Control in High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization. Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence, and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Exponential Framing for Pulsive Temporal Patterns without Repetition or Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting pulsive temporal patterns from a small dataset without their repetition or singularity shows significant importance in manufacturing applications but does not sufficiently attract scientific attention. We propose to quantify how long temporal patterns appear without relying on their repetition or singularity, enabling to extract such temporal patterns from a small dataset. Inspired by the celebrated time delay embedding and data-driven Hankel matrix analysis, we introduce a linear dynamical system model on the time-delay coordinates behind the data to derive the discrete-time bases each of which has a distinct exponential decay constant. The derived bases are fitted onto subsequences that are extracted with a sliding window in order to quantify how long patterns are dominant in the set of subsequences. We call the quantification method Data-driven Exponential Framing (DEF). A toy model-based experiment shows that DEF can identify multiple patterns with distinct lengths. DEF is also applied to electric current measurement on a punching machine, showing its possibility to extract multiple patterns from real-world oscillatory data.</description>

      <title>Smart Sensor Placement: A Correlation-Aware Attribution Framework (CAAF) for Real-world Data Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal sensor placement (OSP) is critical for efficient, accurate monitoring, control, and inference in complex real-world systems. We propose a machine-learning-based feature attribution framework to identify OSP for the prediction of quantities of interest. Feature attribution quantifies input contributions to a model's output; however, it struggles with highly correlated input data often encountered in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a Correlation-Aware Attribution Framework (CAAF), which introduces a clustering step before performing feature attribution to reduce redundancy and enhance generalizability. We first illustrate the core principles of the proposed framework through a series of validation cases, then demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world dynamical systems, such as structural health monitoring, airfoil lift prediction, and wall-normal velocity estimation for turbulent channel flow. The results show that the CAAF outperforms alternative approaches that typically struggle due to the presence of nonlinear dynamics, chaotic behavior, and multi-scale interactions, and enables the effective application of feature attribution for identifying OSP in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>SPIRAL: Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for Learning in Multi-Drone Competitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SPIRAL (Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for Learning), a novel approach for training autonomous drones in multi-agent racing competitions. SPIRAL distinctively employs a self-play mechanism to incrementally cultivate complex racing behaviors within a challenging, dynamic environment. Through this self-play core, drones continuously compete against increasingly proficient versions of themselves, naturally escalating the difficulty of competitive interactions. This progressive learning journey guides agents from mastering fundamental flight control to executing sophisticated cooperative multi-drone racing strategies. Our method is designed for versatility, allowing integration with any state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms within its self-play framework. Simulations demonstrate the significant advantages of SPIRAL and benchmark the performance of various DRL algorithms operating within it. Consequently, we contribute a versatile, scalable, and self-improving learning framework to the field of autonomous drone racing. SPIRAL's capacity to autonomously generate appropriate and escalating challenges through its self-play dynamic offers a promising direction for developing robust and adaptive racing strategies in multi-agent environments. This research opens new avenues for enhancing the performance and reliability of autonomous racing drones in increasingly complex and competitive scenarios.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coordination of multiple autonomous agents in high-speed, competitive environments represents a significant engineering challenge. This paper presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone Racing), a reinforcement learning framework designed to solve this challenge in the demanding domain of multi-drone racing. CRUISE overcomes key scalability limitations by synergistically combining a progressive difficulty curriculum with an efficient self-play mechanism to foster robust competitive behaviors. Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement learning baseline and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner. CRUISE achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation studies confirm that the curriculum structure is the critical component for this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic, competitive tasks and serves as a blueprint for future real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Analytical Swarm Chemistry: Characterization and Analysis of Emergent Swarm Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior. Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice. By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm systems.</description>

      <title>Never Too Rigid to Reach: Adaptive Virtual Model Control with LLM- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL), which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components, improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Design and Validation of a Low-Cost Stewart Platform with Nonlinear Estimation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the complete design, control, and experimental validation of a low-cost Stewart platform prototype developed as an affordable yet capable robotic testbed for research and education. The platform combines off the shelf components with 3D printed and custom fabricated parts to deliver full six degrees of freedom motions using six linear actuators connecting a moving platform to a fixed base. The system software integrates dynamic modeling, data acquisition, and real time control within a unified framework. A robust trajectory tracking controller based on feedback linearization, augmented with an LQR scheme, compensates for the platform's nonlinear dynamics to achieve precise motion control. In parallel, an Extended Kalman Filter fuses IMU and actuator encoder feedback to provide accurate and reliable state estimation under sensor noise and external disturbances. Unlike prior efforts that emphasize only isolated aspects such as modeling or control, this work delivers a complete hardware-software platform validated through both simulation and experiments on static and dynamic trajectories. Results demonstrate effective trajectory tracking and real-time state estimation, highlighting the platform's potential as a cost effective and versatile tool for advanced research and educational applications.</description>

      <title>An Intelligent Water-Saving Irrigation System Based on Multi-Sensor Fusion and Visual Servoing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.</description>

      <title>Planning Oriented Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous localization, environment perception, and data exchange for connected autonomous vehicles. However, most existing ISAC designs prioritize sensing accuracy and communication throughput, treating all targets uniformly and overlooking the impact of critical obstacles on motion efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC) framework that reduces the sensing uncertainty of planning-bottleneck obstacles and expands the safe navigable path for the ego-vehicle, thereby bridging the gap between physical-layer optimization and motion-level planning. The core of PISAC lies in deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit power to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy inflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation and motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC beam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free trajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive simulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC achieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times than existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its effectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Seq-DeepIPC: Sequential Sensing for End-to-End Control in Legged Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas. Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we will release the codes to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.</description>

      <title>zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and statistical consistency of the detection tests, allowing regulators to temporally verify alarm correctness without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Combining High Level Scheduling and Low Level Control to Manage Fleets of Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flexibility aggregation via set projection for distribution grids with multiple interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing number of flexible energy devices in distribution grids, coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) becomes critical for optimal system operation. One form of coordination is to solve the overall system operation problem in a hierarchical way, computing Feasible Operational Regions (FORs) for the interconnection between TSO/DSO. Most methods for computing FORs rely on the assumption of only one interconnection point between TSO and DSOs, which is often violated in practice. In this work, we propose a method for computing FORs in distribution grids with multiple interconnection points to the transmission grid. We test our method in a grid with two interconnecting points and analyze the properties of the resulting high-dimensional FOR from a power systems perspective.</description>

      <title>From Zonal to Nodal Capacity Expansion Planning: Spatial Aggregation Impacts on a Realistic Test-Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving power system capacity expansion planning (CEP) problems at realistic spatial resolutions is computationally challenging. Thus, a common practice is to solve CEP over zonal models with low spatial resolution rather than over full-scale nodal power networks. Due to improvements in solving large-scale stochastic mixed integer programs, these computational limitations are becoming less relevant, and the assumption that zonal models are realistic and useful approximations of nodal CEP is worth revisiting. This work is the first to conduct a systematic computational study on the assumption that spatial aggregation can reasonably be used for ISO- and interconnect-scale CEP. By considering a realistic, large-scale test network based on the state of California with over 8,000 buses and 10,000 transmission lines, we demonstrate that well-designed small spatial aggregations can yield good approximations but that coarser zonal models result in large distortions of investment decisions.</description>

Abstract: In this document, we present key findings in structured matrix approximation theory, with applications to the regressive representation of dynamic financial processes. Initially, we explore a comprehensive approach involving generic nonlinear time delay embedding for time series data extracted from a financial or economic system under examination. Subsequently, we employ sparse least-squares and structured matrix approximation methods to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These representations play a pivotal role in establishing the regressive models corresponding to the recursive structures inherent in a given financial system. The document further introduces prototypical algorithms that leverage the aforementioned techniques. These algorithms are demonstrated through applications in approximate identification and predictive simulation of dynamic financial and economic processes, encompassing scenarios that may or may not exhibit chaotic behavior.</description>

In particular, we present output-feedback and state-feedback-based LPV-DPC methods with terminal ingredients, which guarantee exponential stability and recursive feasibility. We provide methods for the data-based computation of these terminal ingredients. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the application and implementation aspects of the LPV-DPC schemes is given, including application for nonlinear systems and handling noisy data. We compare and demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a detailed simulation example involving a nonlinear unbalanced disc system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution system end users are transforming from passive to active participants, marked by the push towards widespread adoption of edge-level Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). This paper addresses the challenges in distribution system planning arising from these dynamic changes. We introduce a bottom-up probabilistic approach that integrates these edge-level DERs into the reliability evaluation process. Our methodology leverages joint probability distributions to characterize and model the penetration of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage across a distribution network at the individual residential level. Employing a scenario-based approach, we showcase the application of our probabilistic method using a Monte Carlo Simulation process to assess average system reliability indices and their variations at the user level. To validate our approach, we applied this methodology to the RBTS test system across various adoption scenarios, effectively showcasing the capability of our proposed method in quantifying the variation in end-user reliability indices for each scenario within the distribution system.</description>

      <title>A general framework for supporting economic feasibility of generator and storage energy systems through capacity and dispatch optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of various electricity-generating technologies (such as natural gas, wind, nuclear, etc.) with storage systems (such as thermal, battery electric, hydrogen, etc.) has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness of modern energy systems. Driven by the need to efficiently assess the economic feasibility of various energy system configurations in early system concept development, this work outlines a versatile computational framework for assessing the net present value of various integrated storage technologies. The subsystems' fundamental dynamics are defined, with a particular emphasis on balancing critical physical and economic domains to enable optimal decision-making in the context of capacity and dispatch optimization. In its presented form, the framework formulates a linear, convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a direct transcription approach in the open-source software DTQP. Three case studies demonstrate and validate the framework's capabilities, highlighting its value and computational efficiency in facilitating the economic assessment of various energy system configurations. In particular, natural gas with thermal storage and carbon capture, wind energy with battery storage, and nuclear with hydrogen are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Composite Learning Adaptive Control under Non-Persistent Partial Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on relaxing the excitation conditions for the adaptive control of uncertain nonlinear systems. By adopting the spectral decomposition technique, a linear regression equation (LRE) is constructed to quantitatively collect historical excitation information, based on which the parameter estimation error is decomposed into the excited component and the unexcited component. By sufficiently utilizing the collected excitation information, the composite learning and {\mu}-modification terms are designed and incorporated into the "Lyapunov-based" parameter update law. By developing a novel Lyapunov function, it is demonstrated that under non-persistent partial excitation, the control error and the excited parameter estimation error component converge to zero, while the unexcited component remains bounded. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive control scheme can effectively eliminate the effects of parametric uncertainties and enhance the robustness of the closed-loop systems. Simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction with Koopman Generalized Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to achieve lower-dimensional Koopman quasi-linear representations of nonlinear system dynamics using Koopman generalized eigenfunctions. The proposed approach considers the analytically derived Koopman formulation of rigid body dynamics, but it can be extended to any data-driven or analytically derived generalized eigenfunction set. It achieves a representation for which the number of Koopman observables matches the number of inputs allowing for Koopman linearization control solutions rather than resorting to the least squares approximation method adopted in high dimensional Koopman formulations. Through a linear combination of Koopman generalized eigenfunctions a new set of Koopman generalized eigenfunction is constructed so that the zero order truncation approximate a Koopman eigenfunction which can be used to design linear control strategies to steer the dynamics of the original nonlinear system. The proposed methodology is tested by designing a linear quadratic (LQ) flight controller for a quadrotor UAV. Numerical and Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations validate the applicability and real-time implementability of the proposed approach in the presence of noise and sensor delays. The main advantage of the proposed method is the realization of a fully actuated Koopman based model which, in the case of the underactuated quadrotor system, allows to achieve trajectory tracking through a single linear control loop.</description>

      <title>ExAMPC: the Data-Driven Explainable and Approximate NMPC with Physical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amidst the surge in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for control purposes, classical and model-based control methods maintain their popularity due to their transparency and deterministic nature. However, advanced controllers like Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), despite proven capabilities, face adoption challenges due to their computational complexity and unpredictable closed-loop performance in complex validation systems. This paper introduces ExAMPC, a methodology bridging classical control and explainable AI by augmenting the NMPC with data-driven insights to improve the trustworthiness and reveal the optimization solution and closed-loop performance's sensitivities to physical variables and system parameters. By employing a low-order spline embedding, we reduce the open-loop trajectory dimensionality by over 95%, and integrate it with SHAP and Symbolic Regression from eXplainable AI (XAI) for an approximate NMPC, enabling intuitive physical insights into the NMPC's optimization routine. The prediction accuracy of the approximate NMPC is enhanced through physics-inspired continuous-time constraints penalties, reducing the predicted continuous trajectory violations by 93%. ExAMPC also enables accurate forecasting of the NMPC's computational requirements with explainable insights on worst-case scenarios. Experimental validation on automated valet parking and autonomous racing with lap-time optimization, demonstrates the methodology's practical effectiveness for potential real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Formally Verified Neural Network Controllers for Incremental Input-to-State Stability of Unknown Discrete-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to synthesize a controller that ensures that an unknown discrete-time system is incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this work, we introduce the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF), which, in conjunction with the controller, ensures that the closed-loop system is incrementally ISS. To address the unknown dynamics of the system, we parameterize the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF as neural networks and learn them by utilizing the sampled data from the state space of the unknown system. To formally verify the obtained $\delta$-ISS-CLF, we develop a validity condition and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed approach is proved using multiple case studies - the first one is a scalar system with a non-affine non-polynomial structure, the second example is a one-link manipulator system, the third system is a nonlinear Moore-Grietzer model of the jet engine and the final one is a rotating rigid spacecraft model.</description>

      <title>Security of Gradient Tracking Algorithms Against Malicious Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus algorithms are fundamental to multi-agent distributed optimization, and their security under adversarial conditions is an active area of research. While prior works primarily establish conditions for successful global consensus under attack, little is known about system behavior when these conditions are violated. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the robustness of the Wang--Elia algorithm, which is a robust to noise version of gradient tracking algorithm, in the presence of malicious agents. We consider a network of agents collaboratively minimizing a global cost function, where a subset of agents may transmit faulty information to disrupt consensus. To quantify resilience, we formulate a security metric as an optimization problem, which is rooted in centralized attack detection literature. We provide a tractable reformulation of the optimization problem, and derive conditions under which the metric becomes unbounded, identifying undetectable attack signals that reveal inherent vulnerabilities. To facilitate design and analysis, we propose a well-posed variant of the metric and propose design methods to enhance network robustness against stealthy adversarial attacks. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework to enhance the resilience of multi-agent distributed optimization.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Peak Demand Probability Density Forecasting with Application to Risk-Aware Power System Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01358v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power systems face increasing challenges in maintaining resource adequacy due to lower operating margins, rising renewable energy uncertainty, and demand variability. Forecasting the probability distribution of peak demand on shorter timescales is a critical forward-facing issue under increasing volatility. This study introduces a novel ensemble-based machine learning method for peak demand probability density forecasting that extends classical extreme value theory to model time series peaks as nonstationary statistical distributions. The approach employs an ensemble of tree-based learners that recursively partition the covariate space and estimate local generalized extreme value distributions, allowing it to automatically capture complex covariate-dependent parameter variations. Unlike existing approaches, which often suffer from convergence issues or restrictive functional forms, this framework is both flexible and robust. Validation on a case study based on the PJM interconnection demonstrates that the method achieves a 38 percent reduction in committed capacity when generation is scheduled based on a reliability criterion. These improvements provide practical value for power system operation, enabling risk-aware capacity scheduling under peak demand uncertainty and supporting reliability-driven decision making in future energy systems.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</description>

      <title>Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). This structure commonly arises in practice when decisions must be made at high frequencies over long horizons, and where slowly changing information still plays a critical role in determining optimal actions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand indicators or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during phases of lower-level planning and subsequently applies value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off regret versus computational cost. Empirically, we benchmark our new frozen-state methods on three domains, (i) inventory control with fixed order costs, (ii) a gridworld problem with spatial tasks, and (iii) dynamic pricing with reference-price effects. We demonstrate that the new methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Gradient Methods for Nonconvex Optimization: Escape Trajectories From Strict Saddle Points and Convergence to Local Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of understanding the behavior of a general class of accelerated gradient methods on smooth nonconvex functions. Motivated by some recent works that have proposed effective algorithms, based on Polyak's heavy ball method and the Nesterov accelerated gradient method, to achieve convergence to a local minimum of nonconvex functions, this work proposes a broad class of Nesterov-type accelerated methods and puts forth a rigorous study of these methods encompassing the escape from saddle points and convergence to local minima through both an asymptotic and a non-asymptotic analysis. In the asymptotic regime, this paper answers an open question of whether Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) with variable momentum parameter avoids strict saddle points almost surely. This work also develops two metrics of asymptotic rates of convergence and divergence, and evaluates these two metrics for several popular standard accelerated methods such as the NAG and Nesterov's accelerated gradient with constant momentum (NCM) near strict saddle points. In the non-asymptotic regime, this work provides an analysis that leads to the "linear" exit time estimates from strict saddle neighborhoods for trajectories of these accelerated methods as well the necessary conditions for the existence of such trajectories. Finally, this work studies a sub-class of accelerated methods that can converge in convex neighborhoods of nonconvex functions with a near optimal rate to a local minimum and at the same time this sub-class offers superior saddle-escape behavior compared to that of NAG.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks: A Peer-to-Peer ACIDE Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mobile wireless networks, livestreaming in high user density areas presents two typical challenges: the wireless bandwidth is depleted and the number of users is limited. In this study, a media distribution model utilizing peer to peer communications, Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment, is proposed for bandwidth efficient livestreaming. The basic idea is to group users with identical livestream interest in a cluster of n peers. Instead of sending n copies of a livestream package, only one copy is sent to the cluster. A package is divided into n blocks. Each user receives one block from the base station and the remaining n-1 blocks from the other peers. Two optimization problems are addressed. The first problem is minimizing the bandwidth needed to guarantee a continuous live media play on all peers. A solution is proposed to find the optimal block sizes such that the wireless bandwidth is minimized. The second problem is maximizing the number of peers admitted to a cluster, given a fixed wireless bandwidth. This problem is NP-complete and a greedy strategy is proposed to calculate a feasible solution for peer selection. The proposed model improves the bandwidth efficiency and allows more users to be served.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise in Mesoscopic Hybrid Junctions: Influence of Barrier Strength and Thermal Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</description>

Abstract: Communication and position sensing are among the most important capabilities for swarm robots to interact with their peers and perform tasks collaboratively. However, the hardware required to facilitate communication and position sensing is often too complicated, expensive, and bulky to be carried on swarm robots. Here we present Maneuverable Piccolissimo 3 (MP3), a minimalist, single motor drone capable of executing inter-robot communication via infrared light and triangulation-based sensing of relative bearing, distance, and elevation using message arrival time. Thanks to its novel design, MP3 can communicate with peers and localize itself using simple components, keeping its size and mass small and making it inherently safe for human interaction. We present the hardware and software design of MP3 and demonstrate its capability to localize itself, fly stably, and maneuver in the environment using peer-to-peer communication and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18361v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, designed to operate in human-centric environments, serve as a fundamental platform for a broad range of tasks. Although humanoid robots have been extensively studied for decades, a majority of existing humanoid robots still heavily rely on complex modular frameworks, leading to inflexibility and potential compounded errors from independent sensing, planning, and acting components. In response, we propose an end-to-end humanoid sense-plan-act walking system, enabling vision-based obstacle avoidance and footstep planning for whole body balancing simultaneously. We designed two imperative learning (IL)-based bilevel optimizations for model-predictive step planning and whole body balancing, respectively, to achieve self-supervised learning for humanoid robot walking. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. We refer to our method as iWalker and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward autonomous humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>Prognostic Framework for Robotic Manipulators Operating Under Dynamic Task Severities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we address the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems with unknown dynamics. We propose a hierarchical planning framework that enables zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks by leveraging only task-agnostic trajectory data during offline training. The framework consists of three key components: (i) decomposing the STL specification into several progresses and time constraints, (ii) searching for timed waypoints that satisfy all progresses under time constraints, and (iii) generating trajectory segments using a pre-trained diffusion model and stitching them into complete trajectories. We formally prove that our method guarantees STL satisfaction, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating dynamically feasible trajectories across diverse long-horizon STL tasks.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Soft Robot Control via Adiabatic Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate our data-driven model's effectiveness in tracking dynamic trajectories across diverse tasks, validated on a high-fidelity, high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot and a Cosserat rod-based elastic soft arm. Notably, we find that five- or six-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to $10$ across all closed-loop control tasks.</description>

      <title>CIVIL: Causal and Intuitive Visual Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's robots attempt to learn new tasks by imitating human examples. These robots watch the human complete the task, and then try to match the actions taken by the human expert. However, this standard approach to visual imitation learning is fundamentally limited: the robot observes what the human does, but not why the human chooses those behaviors. Without understanding which features of the system or environment factor into the human's decisions, robot learners often misinterpret the human's examples. In practice, this results in causal confusion, inefficient learning, and robot policies that fail when the environment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective: instead of asking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should take, we also enable humans to intuitively indicate why they made those decisions. Under our paradigm human teachers attach markers to task-relevant objects and use natural language prompts to describe their state representation. Our proposed algorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented demonstration data to filter the robot's visual observations and extract a feature representation that aligns with the human teacher. CIVIL then applies these causal features to train a transformer-based policy that -- when tested on the robot -- is able to emulate human behaviors without being confused by visual distractors or irrelevant items. Our simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that robots trained with CIVIL learn both what actions to take and why to take those actions, resulting in better performance than state-of-the-art baselines. From the human's perspective, our user study reveals that this new training paradigm actually reduces the total time required for the robot to learn the task, and also improves the robot's performance in previously unseen scenarios.

      <title>Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs and Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose opinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing models of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions.</description>

      <title>Koopman Eigenfunction-Based Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10438v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</description>

      <title>FlightKooba: A Fast Interpretable FTP Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction (FTP) and similar time series tasks typically require capturing smooth latent dynamics hidden within noisy signals. However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Satellite Attitude Dynamics with Physics-Informed Normalising Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks, relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete, difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data. However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of the mean relative error with the best architectures found by 27.08%. These advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, and achieve improved settling times when compared to traditional MPC approaches, yielding improvements of up to 62%, when subject to observation noise and RWs friction.</description>

      <title>Stability Criteria and Motor Performance in Delayed Haptic Dyadic Interactions Mediated by Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters, where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for effective delay-compensation strategies.</description>
