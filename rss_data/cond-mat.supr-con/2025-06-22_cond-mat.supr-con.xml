      <title>On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of S\'eamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. R\"ohler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Exceedingly large in-plane critical field of finite-momentum pairing state in bulk superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux profoundly influences the phase factor of charge particles, leading to exotic quantum phenomena. A recent example is that the orbital effect of magnetic field could induce finite-momentum pairing state in nanoflakes, which offers a new pathway to realize the spatially modulated superconductivity distinct from the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state induced by Zeeman effect. However, whether such intriguing state can exist in the bulk materials under extremely large magnetic field remains elusive. Here we report the orbital effect induced finite-momentum pairing state with exceedingly large in-plane critical field in a bulk superconducting superlattice. Remarkably, the in-plane critical field shows a pronounced upturn behavior, exceeding eight times the Pauli limit which is comparable to monolayer Ising superconductor. Under high in-plane magnetic fields, significant anisotropic transport behavior between the interlayer and intralayer directions is detected, highlighting the critical role of suppressed interlayer coherence in the orbital effect induced finite-momentum pairing state. Crucially, this finite-momentum pairing state remains robust against moderate disorder. Our findings suggest that van der Waals superlattices, with strong Ising spin-orbit coupling and tunable interlayer coherence, offer new avenues for constructing and modulating unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Superfluid dome in the spatially modulated two-dimensional XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly correlated electron systems, superconductivity and charge density waves often coexist in close proximity, suggesting a deeper relationship between these competing phases. Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Superconducting critical temperature and dimensionality tuning of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ via biaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) has emerged as an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and other quantum states. Among the three compounds, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a notably lower superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) at ambient pressure, posing challenges in exploring the superconducting state. For instance, the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) is small and thus difficult to measure accurately against other control parameters. Hence, enhancing superconductivity would facilitate $H_{c2}$ measurements, providing insights into key superconducting properties such as the dimensionality. In this letter, we report the tuning of the $T_c$ in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the application of biaxial strain. Utilizing a negative thermal expansion material ZrW$_2$O$_8$ as a substrate, we achieve a substantial biaxial strain of $\epsilon=1.50\%$, resulting in a remarkable 75\% enhancement in $T_c$. We investigate the $H_{c2}$ as a function of temperature, revealing a transition from multi-band to single-band superconductivity with increasing tensile strain. Additionally, we study the $H_{c2}$ as a function of field angle, revealing a plausible correlation between the $T_c$ enhancement and the change in dimensionality of the superconductivity under tensile strain. Further analysis quantitatively illustrates a transition towards two-dimensional superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when subjected to tensile strain. Our work demonstrates that the application of biaxial strain allows for the tuning of both the $T_c$ and superconducting dimensionality in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Full-Gap Superconductivity in BaAs/Ferropnictide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial interactions often promote the emergence of unusual phenomena in two-dimensional systems, including high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of full-gap superconductivity with a maximal spectroscopic temperature up to 26 K in a BaAs monolayer grown on ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (abbreviated as BFCA) epitaxial films. The superconducting gap remains robust even when the thickness of underlying BFCA is reduced to the monolayer limit, in contrast to the rapid suppression of $T_\textrm{c}$ in standalone BFCA thin films. We reveal that the exceptional crystallinity of the BaAs/BFCA heterostructures, featured by their remarkable electronic and geometric uniformities, is crucial for the emergent full-gap superconductivity with mean-field temperature dependence and pronounced bound states within magnetic vortices. Our findings open up new avenues to unravel the mysteries of unconventional superconductivity in ferropnictides and advance the development of FeAs-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale imaging of electronic nematicity in ferropnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic nematicity, a correlated state characterized by broken rotational symmetry, has been recognized as a ubiquitous feature intertwined with unconventional electron pairing in various iron-based superconductors. Here we employ spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize atomic-scale electronic nematicity directly on FeAs planes of a prototypical ferropnictide BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Spatially, the nematic order appears as 4$a_{\textrm{Fe}}$-spaced stripes ($a_{\textrm{Fe}} \sim $ 0.28 nm is the in-plane Fe-Fe distance) within homogeneously and orthogonally oriented nano-domains. The energy-resolved conductance maps reveal a pronounced energy-dependence of the nematic order parameter that experiences a sign change at approximately 30 meV. This characteristic behavior coincides with energy-dependent orbital splitting previously identified in momentum space, but is remarkably visualized in real space for the first time in our study. Moreover, the electronic nematicity exhibits pronounced sensitivity to single impurities and is notably suppressed by cobalt substitution for Fe atoms, promoting optimal superconductivity when nematic fluctuations are strongest. Our results provide pivotal experimental insights for developing a microscopic model of nematic order, thus paving the way to study its complex relationship with unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Universally enhanced superconductivity and coexisting ferroelectricity at oxide interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferroelectricity is rare due to their conflicting requirements: superconductivity relies on free charge carriers, whereas ferroelectricity typically occurs in insulating systems. At LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces, we demonstrate the coexistence of two-dimensional superconductivity and ferroelectricity, enabled by the unique properties of KTaO3 as a quantum paraelectric. Systematic gating and poling experiments reveal a universal enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) by 0.2-0.6 K and bistable transport properties, including hysteresis, strongly suggesting the existence of switchable ferroelectric polarization in the interfacial conducting layer. Hysteresis loops indicate robust ferroelectricity below 50 K. The Tc enhancement is attributed to ferroelectric polarization-induced reduction in dielectric constant, which narrows the interfacial potential well, confining carriers closer to the interface. The bistability arises from switchable ferroelectric polarization, which modulates the potential well depending on polarization direction. These findings establish a straightforward mechanism coupling ferroelectricity and superconductivity, providing a promising platform for exploring their interplay.</description>

      <title>Real-space visualization of orbital-selective superconductivity in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orbitally resolved superconducting properties of bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the spectral weights of both the large $\Delta_1$ and small $\Delta_2$ superconducting gaps remain nearly unchanged at the top Se sites as the STM tip approaches atomic contact. In contrast, the spectral weight of $\Delta_2$ increases significantly at the Fe and bottom Se sites. These results suggest that the gap $\Delta_2$ is localized in the xy-plane and likely associated with the dxy orbital band. Furthermore, we observe a long-range suppression of the large gap $\Delta_1$ near one-dimensional (1D) defects such as twin boundaries, wrinkles, and step edges, whereas $\Delta_2$ remains robust. This indicates that the two superconducting gaps respond differently to such 1D defects. High-resolution measurement using a Pb-coated tip reveals localized in-gap states near 1D defects, indicating possible defect-induced magnetism. Our findings highlight the contrasting behaviors of gap $\Delta_1$ and gap $\Delta_2$ in response to local electronic and magnetic environments and provide real-space evidence for orbital-selective superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized edge modes between different magnet-superconductor-hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetism and superconductivity can lead to intriguing emergent phenomena. Here we combine two different two-dimensional antiferromagnetic magnet-superconductor hybrids (MSH) and study their properties using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Both MSHs show the characteristics of a topological nodal point superconducting phase with edge modes to the trivial substrate superconductor. At the boundary between the two MSHs we find low-energy modes which are spin-polarized. Based on a tight-binding model we can explain the experimental observations by considering two different topological nodal point superconductors. This gives rise to spin-polarized chiral edge modes that connect topological nodal points of the two different MSH. We demonstrate via the complex band structure that due to an asymmetric lateral decay these edge modes are spin-polarized, regardless of the details of the spin structure at the boundary. The presence of spin-polarized edge states between different topological superconductors enables advanced functional design for the exploitation of MSHs as a platform for topology-based applications.</description>

      <title>Band-like Exact Zero-energy Andreev Bound States and Superconducting Diode Effect in Mixed ${s+p}$-wave Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Josephson junctions enable nonreciprocal transport involving Majorana fermions (MFs). Here we examine a topological Josephson junction with mixed $s$+$p$-wave pairing, where topological phase transition can be driven by adjusting the ratio between the pairing components. There exist two exact symmetrically positioned zero-energy level crossings for the Andreev-bound states, which can be shifted by external fields, and can be destroyed or recreated in pairs by a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field or inhomogeneities, exhibiting band-like structure. The dependence of the shift on the Zeeman field is linear when the two $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors on both sides are identical while quadratic when they are distinct. Near the topological phase transition, the topological $p$-wave dominant junctions host MF-induced pronounced superconducting diode effect with high efficiency factor $Q$ up to 30 %, in contrast to the trivial $s$-wave dominant junctions possessing relatively small $Q$.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of superconducting fluctuations and quasiparticle interference at oxide interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tunable superconducting transitions in (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{KTaO}_3$ field-effect devices. Large increases in conductivity, associated with superconducting fluctuations, are observed far above the transition temperature. However, the standard Aslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity model significantly underestimates the effect observed here. We use a model that includes conductivity corrections from normal state quasiparticle interference together with all contributions from superconducting fluctuations evaluated at arbitrary temperatures and in the short-wavelength limit. Through analysis of the magnetoconductance and resistive transitions, we find that the large conductivity increase can be explained by a combination of weak anti-localization and Maki-Thompson superconducting fluctuations. Both contributions are enabled by a strong temperature dependence of the electron's decoherence time compatible with an electron-phonon scattering scenario. We find that conductivity corrections are modulated by the electrostatic field effect, that governs a competition between normal-state quasiparticle interference and superconducting fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Axion electrodynamics of Weyl superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Robust Superconductivity Phenomenon of High-Entropy Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate a "robust superconductivity phenomenon" in niobium-based alloys, where the superconducting state remains intact and the critical temperature ($T_c$) is largely unaffected by external pressure well above tens of gigapascal (GPa) into the megabar regime ($\ge 100 GPa$). Motivated by these observations, we perform first-principles electron-phonon calculations for body-centered cubic Nb and NbTi crystals, as well as for special quasi-random structures of Nb$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$ and (NbTa)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.3}$ high-entropy alloy (HEA). The calculations unravel the underlying mechanism of robust superconductivity, stemming from a compensation effect between varying electronic and phonon properties under pressure. The results also reveal how structural and chemical disorders modify the superconducting state. The first-principles $T_c$ values agree quantitatively with the experiments throughout the entire pressure range under study. Our work thereby paves the way for exploring superconducting HEAs under pressure via advanced first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing the pseudogap and beyond: examining single-particle properties of the hole- and electron-doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the Hubbard model using the unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, revealing an asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekul\'{e}-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekul\'{e} bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.</description>

      <title>A Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</description>

      <title>Chirped amplitude mode in photo-excited superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</description>

Abstract: Conventional topological materials rely on band-specific mechanisms -- such as band inversion or spin-orbit coupling -- to realize nontrivial topological invariants. Here, we introduce a symmetry-driven paradigm for generating topological states, exploiting a translational symmetry $\mathcal{L}$ that couples two maximal Wyckoff positions. This symmetry induces robust band degeneracies independent of band structure details, allowing us to classify $\mathcal{L}$ as trivial or nontrivial by quantized electric multipoles. Crucially, for nontrivial $\mathcal{L}$, symmetry-protected edge and corner states emerge universally across all symmetry-compatible insulating, semi-metallic, and metallic phases, irrespective of specific band structure. We demonstrate this in a $C_4$-symmetric model and validate it using an experimentally feasible dielectric photonic crystal engineered with $\mathcal{L}$ symmetry. Through full-wave simulation, we observe directional edge modes and localized corner modes, with the former selectively excited by harmonic point sources spatially shifted by $\mathcal{L}$ at a fixed frequency.</description>

The superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure is predicted to reach 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), with potential further improvements under applied strain. We note that the changes in the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BCS theory has achieved widespread success in describing conventional superconductivity.
  However, when the length scale reaches the atomic limit, the reduced dimensionality may lead to
  the quantum breakdown resulting in unpredictable superconducting behaviors. It has been exper imentally evidenced that the critical temperature is strongly enhanced in the monolayer films of
  FeSe/STO and epitaxial Aluminum. Here, we propose the exciton mechanism of superconductivity
  as a possible reason for the enhanced superconductivity in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
  structures. The exciton-induced Cooper pairing may lead to the larger energy gaps and higher
  critical temperatures as compared to those caused by the phonon induced superconductivity. A
  detailed comparison of the theory and experimental results of Ref. 1 reveals the possibility of
  exciton-induced superconductivity in thin films of Aluminum near the monolayer limit.</description>

Abstract: Modern superconducting radio frequency (SRF) applications demand precise control over material properties across multiple length scales - from microscopic composition, to mesoscopic defect structures, to macroscopic cavity geometry. We present a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) framework that incorporates spatially varying parameters derived from experimental measurements and ab initio calculations, enabling realistic, sample-specific simulations. As a demonstration, we model Sn-deficient islands in Nb$_3$Sn and calculate the field at which vortex nucleation first occurs for various defect configurations. These thresholds serve as a predictive tool for identifying defects likely to degrade SRF cavity performance. We then simulate the resulting dissipation and show how aggregate contributions from multiple small defects can reproduce trends consistent with high-field $Q$-slope behavior observed experimentally. Our results offer a pathway for connecting microscopic defect properties to macroscopic SRF performance using a computationally efficient mesoscopic model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero net transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the ``magnetic memory effect'' observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the collective excitations present in isotropic superconductors including a screened Coulomb interaction. By varying the screening strength, we analyze its impact on the system. We use a formulation of the effective phonon-mediated interaction between electrons that depends on the energy transfer between particles, rather than being a constant in a small energy shell around the Fermi edge. This justifies considering also rather large attractive interactions. We compute the system's Green's functions using the iterated equations of motion (iEoM) approach, which ultimately enables a quantitative analysis of collective excitations. For weak couplings, we identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) mode at the two-particle continuum's lower edge and the phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode at $\omega = 0$ for a neutral system, which shifts to higher energies as the Coulomb interaction is switched on. As the phononic coupling is increased, the Higgs mode separates from the continuum, and additional phase and amplitude modes appear, persisting even in the presence Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the expression, within the linear response approximation, that allows the direct calculation of the superfluid weight for strongly inhomogeneous superconductors. Using this expression, we find that, in general, the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the superconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential is important in superconductors with a strongly inhomogeneous pairing potential. We consider two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the pairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when superconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both cases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant, it must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the case when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that does not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n_{M}\times 2e^{2}/h$ in summed differential conductance with $n_{M}$ being the number of modes~($0$ or $\pi$) localized at one end of the NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor</title>

Abstract: Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. In particular, depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</description>
