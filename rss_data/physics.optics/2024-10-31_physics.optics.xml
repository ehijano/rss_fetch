      <title>Graphene oxide for high performance nonlinear optics in integrated nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report enhanced nonlinear optics in integrated nanophotonic chips through the use of integrated with 2D graphene oxide (GO) films. We investigate nanophotonic platforms including silicon, silicon nitride and high index doped silica. Due to the high Kerr nonlinearity of GO films and low nonlinear absorption we observe significant enhancement of third-order nonlinear processes. In particular, in silicon we observe an increase in both the Kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear figure of merit of up to 20 times. These results show the strong capability of GO films for improving the nonlinear optical performance of integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Towards Neural-Network-based optical temperature sensing of Semiconductor Membrane External Cavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine-learning non-contact method to determine the temperature of a laser gain medium via its laser emission with a trained few-layer neural net model is presented. The training of the feed-forward Neural Network (NN) enables the prediction of the device's properties solely from spectral data, here recorded by visible-/nearinfrared-light compact micro-spectrometers for both a diode pump laser and optically-pumped gain membrane of a semiconductor disk laser. Fiber spectrometers are used for the acquisition of large quantities of labelled intensity data, which can afterwards be used for the prediction process. Such pretrained deep NNs enable a fast, reliable and easy way to infer the temperature of a laser system such as our Membrane External Cavity Laser, at a later monitoring stage without the need of additional optical diagnostics or read-out temperature sensors. With the miniature mobile spectrometer and the remote detection ability, the temperature inference capability can be adapted for various laser diodes using transfer learning methods with pretrained models. Here, mean-square-error values for the temperature inference corresponding to sub-percent accuracy of our sensor scheme are reached, while computational cost can be saved by reducing the network depth at the here displayed cost of accuracy, as appropriate for different application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chiral exceptional point enhanced active tuning and nonreciprocity in micro-resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) have been extensively explored in mechanical, acoustic, plasmonic, and photonic systems. However, little is known about the role of EPs in tailoring the dynamic tunability of optical devices. A specific type of EPs known as chiral EPs has recently attracted much attention for controlling the flow of light and for building sensors with better responsivity. A recently demonstrated route to chiral EPs via lithographically defined symmetric Mie scatterers on the rim of resonators has not only provided the much-needed mechanical stability for studying chiral EPs but also helped reduce losses originating from nanofabrication imperfections, facilitating the in-situ study of chiral EPs and their contribution to the dynamics and tunability of resonators. Here, we use asymmetric Mie scatterers to break the rotational symmetry of a microresonator, to demonstrate deterministic thermal tuning across a chiral EP, and to demonstrate EP-mediated chiral optical nonlinear response and efficient electro-optic tuning. Our results indicate asymmetric electro-optic modulation with up to 17dB contrast at GHz and CMOS-compatible voltage levels. Such wafer-scale nano-manufacturing of chiral electro-optic modulators and the chiral EP-tailored tunning may facilitate new micro-resonator functionalities in quantum information processing, electromagnetic wave control, and optical interconnects.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Polarization and Excitation-Emission Spectrum of Suspended Particles in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of suspended single particles (SSPs) in water is a crucial element for monitoring water ecosystems. Although there are a variety of sensory methods, it is still an unrealized goal to combine multi-wavelength polarized light scattering and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix(EEM) to characterize and classify SSP in water,which can deeply characterize and classify SSPs with different properties. In this paper, we propose an efficient optical method that can simultaneously obtain the SSP's Stokes parameters of four wavelengths and the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) within 125 ns at 120 degree scattering angle in water. We use Mie scattering simulation to validate our method and obtain the optimal parameters for the experiments. We demonstrate the high performance of our method in terms of sensitivity and accuracy through experiments involving microalgae, microplastics and sediments, as well as control experiments under different illumination conditions and classification experiments of harmful microalgae by using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify underwater suspended particles and harmful microalgae based on our method, and show that our method achieves better results than using single-wavelength light. Our method paves the way for the detection of SSPs and polarization research in marine science.</description>

      <title>Polarization-entangled photon pairs generation from a single lithium niobate waveguide with single poling period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pairs are essential sources for photonic quantum information processing. However, generating entangled photon pairs with large detuning via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) often requires complex configurations to compensate for phase matching. Here, we propose a simple and efficient scheme to generate polarization-entangled photon pairs based on type-0 SPDC in a thin-film lithium niobate waveguide with a single poling period. By utilizing the strong dispersion engineering capabilities of thin-film waveguides, we can achieve both degenerate and highly detuned entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip temporal compensation using an integrated waveguide structure. Our approach offers a compact and scalable solution for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>3D Printable Plasmonic Titanium Nitride Nanoparticles Enhanced Thermoplastic Polyurethane Composite for Improved Photothermal De-Icing and Infrared Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanomaterials offer a direct and effective approach to harnessing solar energy. Specifically, plasmonic semiconductors enable a highly efficient light-to-heat conversion process, outperforming noble metals in stability, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. In this study, a composite 3D printing filament (T-TPU), composed of titanium nitride (TiN) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), was synthesized using a combined extrusion process involving a twin-screw extruder and a single-screw extruder. The resulting T-TPU filament could be used with fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing to produce custom-designed patterns. Notably, these printed patterns exhibited superior photothermal performance, with potential applications in photothermal de-icing and infrared labeling. Additionally, the wavelength-dependent plasmonic and photothermal responses of the printed patterns were experimentally investigated and supported by finite elemental method (FEM) simulations, revealing a temperature increase of approximately 2.5 under IR LED light when compared to commercial black thermoplastic polyurethane (C-TPU), that was more obvious than a difference less than 1 under UV or visible LED light sources. Finally, the mechanical properties of T-TPU, altered by the inclusion of TiN nanoparticles, were assessed, showing a slight enhancement in modulus and friction coefficient relative to neat TPU (N-TPU). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that the TiN nanoparticles promoted strong interactions between polymer chains and TiN particles, enhancing the modulus of elasticity and contributing to the improved mechanical properties of T-TPU. These findings suggest improved abrasion resistance, demonstrating the stability and durability of the composite material.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal field controls vector vortex beams in anisotropic epsilon-near-zero metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light plays an important role in metrology, optical trapping and manipulation, communications, quantum technologies, nonlinear optics and provides a rich playground for addressing new optical phenomena. Here we demonstrate a novel approach for manipulating vector vortex beams carrying longitudinal field components using metamaterials with extreme anisotropy. Implementing vectorial spectroscopy, we show that the propagation of complex beams with inhomogeneous polarisation is strongly affected by the interplay of the metamaterial anisotropy with the transverse and longitudinal field structure of the beam. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in the epsilon-near-zero regime, exclusively realised for light polarised along the metamaterial optical axis, strongly influencing the interaction of longitudinal fields with the metamaterial. The requirements on the balance between the transverse and longitudinal fields to maintain a polarisation singularity at the beam axis allow control of the beam modal content, filtering diffraction effects and tailoring spatial polarisation distribution. The proposed approach offers important capabilities for wavefront shaping as well as local spatial polarisation engineering. The understanding of the interaction of vector beams with metamaterials opens new opportunities for applications in microscopy, information encoding, biochemical sensing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>CO$_2$ Conversion in Cu-Pd based Disordered Network Metamaterials with Ultra-Small Mode Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons can drive chemical reactions by directly exciting intramolecular transitions. However, strong coupling of plasmons to single molecules remains a challenge as ultra-small mode volumes are required. In the presented work, we propose Cu-Pd plasmonic network metamaterials as a scalable platform for plasmon-assisted catalysis. Due to the absence of translational symmetry, these networks provide a unique plasmonic environment featuring a large local density of optical states and an unparalleled density of hotspots that effectively localizes light in mode volumes $V&lt;8\cdot10^{-24}$ m$^3$. Catalytic performance tests during CO$_2$ conversion reveal production rates of up to 4.3$\cdot$10$^2$ mmol g$^{-1}$h$^{-1}$ and altered reaction selectivity under light illumination. Importantly, we show that the selectivity of the catalytic process can be tuned by modifying the network's chemical composition, offering a versatile approach to optimize reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Differential High-Frequency Lock-In Probe for Laser-Induced Vacuum Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of laser-induced vacuum birefringence through the use of pulsed lasers coupled to femtosecond optical enhancement cavities. This measurement technique features cavity-enhanced pump and probe pulses, as well as an independent control pulse. The control pulse allows for a differential measurement where the final signal is obtained using high-frequency lock-in detection, greatly mitigating time-dependent cavity birefringence as an important and possibly prohibitive systematic effect. In addition, the method features the economical use of laser power, and results in a relatively simple experimental setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of atomic emitters have proven to be a promising platform to manipulate and engineer optical properties, due to their efficient cooperative response to near-resonant light. Here, we theoretically investigate their use as an efficient metalens. We show that, by spatially tailoring the (sub-wavelength) lattice constants of three consecutive two-dimensional arrays of identical atomic emitters, one can realize a large transmission coefficient with arbitrary position-dependent phase shift, whose robustness against losses is enhanced by the collective response. To characterize the efficiency of this atomic metalens, we perform large-scale numerical simulations involving a substantial number of atoms ($N\sim 5\times 10^5$) that is considerably larger than comparable works. Our results suggest that low-loss, robust optical devices with complex functionalities, ranging from metasurfaces to computer-generated holograms, could be potentially assembled from properly engineered arrays of atomic emitters.</description>

      <title>Fast and reliable atom transport by optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable single atoms have drawn significant attention for their potentials as flying quantum memory in non-local, dynamic quantum computing architectures. However, when dynamic optical tweezers are employed to control atoms opto-mechanically, conventional methods such as adiabatic controls and constant jerk controls are either inherently slow or induce mechanical heating, leading to atom loss over long distances or at high speeds. To address these challenges, we explore the method known as shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) as an efficient alternative for fast and reliable atom transport control. We present a series of proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that STA-based optical tweezer trajectories can achieve both rapid and reliable single-atom transport. These experiments include moving atoms between two locations, adjusting speeds en route, and navigating curved trajectories. Our results indicate that atoms can be transported with a constant acceleration on average over distances that is only limited by trap lifetime, while effectively suppressing vibrational heating. This makes STA methods particularly well-suited for long-distance atom transport, potentially spanning distances over centimeter scales, such as between quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of correlated biphotons through transparent samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon states generated through degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit sharp correlations in the transverse spatial coordinates. This effect, associated with the separability of the biphoton wavefunction into functions of the centroid and the difference coordinates, leads to unique free space propagation features. Here, we show that if a phase object is placed in the image plane of the source, only the propagation of the function of the centroid coordinates is altered. This propagation can be experimentally reconstructed in coincidence imaging and via post-selection on spatially correlated events, which will reveal the diffraction pattern from the object with a phase enhancement due to the probes' two-photon nature. Our findings offer applications for non-interferometric, quantum-enhanced phase imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new theoretical approach to interpreting and reproducing quantum mechanics using trajectory-guided wavelets. Inspired by the 1925 work of Louis de Broglie, we demonstrate that pulses composed of a difference between a retarded wave and an advanced wave (known as antisymmetric waves) are capable of following quantum trajectories predicted by de Broglie-Bohm theory (also known as Bohmian mechanics). Our theory reproduces the main results of orthodox quantum mechanics and, unlike Bohmian theory, is local in the Bell sense. We show that this is linked to the superdeterminism and past-future (anti)symmetry of our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance and Jitter Dependence of the Intrinsic Photon Number Resolution in Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>

Abstract: The ability to resolve photon numbers is crucial in quantum information science and technology, driving the development of detectors with intrinsic photon-number resolving (PNR) capabilities. Although transition edge sensors represent the state-of-the-art in PNR performance, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) offer superior efficiency, speed, noise reduction, and timing precision. Directly inferring photon numbers, however, has only recently become feasible due to advances in readout technology. Despite this, photon-number discrimination remains constrained by the nanowire's electrical properties and readout jitter. In this work, we employ waveguide-integrated SNSPDs and time-resolved measurements to explore how the nanowire kinetic inductance and system jitter affect PNR capabilities. By analyzing the latency time of the photon detection, we can resolve changes in the rising edge of the detection pulse. We find that lower jitter as well as increased kinetic inductance enhances the pulse separation for different photon numbers and improves the PNR capability. Enhancing the kinetic inductance from 165 nH to 872 nH improves PNR quality by 12%, 31% and 23% over the first three photon numbers, though at the cost of reducing the detector's count rate from 165 Mcps to 19 Mcps. Our findings highlight the trade-off between PNR resolution and detector speed.</description>

      <title>Fragile non-Bloch spectrum and unconventional Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian systems, it is a counterintuitive feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that the energy spectrum and eigenstates can be totally different under open or periodic boundary conditions, suggesting that non-Hermitian spectra can be extremely sensitive to non-local perturbations. Here, we show that a wide range of non-Hermitian models with NHSE can even be highly sensitive to local perturbation under open boundary conditions. The spectrum of these models is so fragile that it can be significantly modified by adding only exponentially small perturbations on boundaries. Intriguingly, we show that such fragile spectra are quantified by the Green's function exhibiting unconventional V-shape asymptotic behaviors. Accordingly, bi-directional exponential amplification can be observed. As an interesting consequence, we find a real-to-complex transition of the bulk spectrum induced by exponentially small boundary perturbations. Finally, we reveal a hierarchy of the asymptotic behaviors of non-Hermitian Green's functions, which restricts the frequency range for the presence of unconventional Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Breaking Rayleigh's curse for two unbalanced single-photon emitters: BLESS technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13244v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rayleigh's criterion states that resolving point sources below the point spread function width is impossible, with error increasing at shorter distances, known as Rayleigh's curse. While detection mode shaping solves this for equal sources, it fails for unbalanced sources with unknown brightness ratios. We propose BLESS, a technique using Beam moduLation and Examination of Shot Statistics, breaking Rayleigh's curse for unbalanced sources. Classical and quantum Cramer-Rao bound calculations show BLESS's strong potential for real imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Intuitive understanding of extinction of small particles in absorbing and active host media within the MLWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an absorbing or an active host medium characterized by a complex refractive index $n_2=n_2'+{\rm i}n_2''$, our previously developed modified dipole long-wave approximation (MLWA) is shown to essentially overly with the exact Mie theory results for spherical nanoparticle with radius $a\lesssim 25$ nm ($a\lesssim 20$ nm) in the case of Ag and Au (Al and Mg) nanoparticles. The agreement for Au and Ag (Al and Mg) nanoparticles, slightly better in the case of Au than Ag, continues to be acceptable up to $a\sim 50$ nm ($a\sim 40$ nm), and can be used, at least qualitatively, up to $a\sim 70$~nm ($a\sim 50$ nm) correspondingly. A first order analytic perturbation theory (PT) in a normalized extinction coefficient, $\bar\kappa=n_2''/n_2'$, around a nonabsorbing host is developed within the dipole MLWA and its properties are investigated. It is shown that, in a suitable parameter range, the PT can reliably capture the effect of host absorption or gain on the extinction efficiency of various plasmonic nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Quantum efficiency and vertical position of quantum emitters in hBN determined by Purcell effect in hybrid metal-dielectric planar photonic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) advantageously combine excellent photophysical properties with a potential for integration in highly compact devices. Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high quantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we compare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated by electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.</description>

      <title>Maximum Shannon Capacity of Photonic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information transfer through electromagnetic waves is an important problem that touches a variety of technologically relevant applications, including computing and telecommunications. Prior attempts to establish limits on optical information transfer have treated waves propagating through known photonic structures (including vacuum). In this article, we address fundamental questions concerning optimal information transfer in photonic devices. Combining information theory, wave scattering, and optimization theory, we formulate bounds on the maximum Shannon capacity that may be achieved by structuring senders, receivers, and their environment. Allowing for arbitrary structuring leads to a non-convex problem that is significantly more difficult than its fixed structure counterpart, which is convex and satisfies a known "water-filling" solution. We derive a geometry-agnostic convex relaxation of the problem that elucidates fundamental physics and scaling behavior of Shannon capacity with respect to device parameters and the importance of structuring for enhancing capacity. We also show that in regimes where communication is dominated by power insertion requirements, bounding Shannon capacity maps to a biconvex optimization problem in the basis of singular vectors of the Green's function. This problem admits analytical solutions that give physically intuitive interpretations of channel and power allocation and reveals how Shannon capacity varies with signal-to-noise ratio. Proof of concept numerical examples show that bounds are within an order of magnitude of achievable device performance and successfully predict the scaling of performance with channel noise. The presented methodologies have implications for the optimization of antennas, integrated photonic devices, metasurface kernels, MIMO space-division multiplexers, and waveguides to maximize communication efficiency and bit-rates.</description>

      <title>Crossed laser phase plates for transmission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades since the development of phase-contrast optical microscopy, an analogous approach has been sought for maximizing the image contrast of weakly-scattering objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave provides stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, achieving phase-contrast TEM. Building on proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations, this paper explores design improvements tailored to biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP increases information transfer at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which dramatically suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.</description>

      <title>Criteria for objects suitable for reconstruction from holograms and diffraction patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, quantitative criteria for reconstruction of objects from their hologram and diffraction patterns, and in particular for the phase objects in digital holography, are derived. The criteria that allow distinguishing the hologram and diffraction pattern are outlined. Gabor derived his criterion for objects suitable for holography based on the condition that the background in the reconstructed object's distribution should be nearly flat so that its intensity contrast does not exceed 0.05.According to Gabor, an opaque object is suitable for holographic reconstruction if it occupies no more than 0.01 of the imaged area, and a phase-shifting object cannot be reconstructed in principle. We revisit these criteria and show that both types of objects can be reconstructed when the object occupies less than 0.01 of the total illuminated area. In addition, a simplified derivation of the criteria is provided that is based on the use of Parseval's theorem, and it is shown that in general, objects (including amplitude-only and phase-only) can be reconstructed at signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher, provided the object occupies less than 0.005 of the total illuminated area. In addition, a simplified derivation of the criteria is provided that is based on Parseval's theorem. It is shown that for objects reconstructed from their holograms and the twin image treated as noise, the signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher can be achieved provided the object occupies less than 0.005 of the total illuminated area When a hologram is reconstructed by applying iterative algorithms, the requirement for the object size is much more generous and identical to that applied in coherent diffraction imaging: any type of object (amplitude-only, phase-only, or amplitude-and-phase mixed properties) is suitable for holography when the object's size in each dimension is less than half of the probed region's extent.</description>

      <title>First-in-human spinal cord tumor imaging with fast adaptive focus tracking robotic-OCT</title>

Abstract: Current surgical procedures for spinal cord tumors lack in vivo high-resolution, high-speed multifunctional imaging systems, posing challenges for precise tumor resection and intraoperative decision-making. This study introduces the Fast Adaptive Focus Tracking Robotic Optical Coherence Tomography (FACT-ROCT) system,designed to overcome these obstacles by providing real-time, artifact-free multifunctional imaging of spinal cord tumors during surgery. By integrating cross-scanning, adaptive focus tracking and robotics, the system addresses motion artifacts and resolution degradation from tissue movement, achieving wide-area, high-resolution imaging. We conducted intraoperative imaging on 21 patients, including 13 with spinal gliomas and 8 with other tumors. This study marks the first demonstration of OCT in situ imaging of human spinal cord tumors, providing micrometer-scale in vivo structural images and demonstrating FACT-ROCT's potential to differentiate various tumor types in real-time. Analysis of the attenuation coefficients of spinal gliomas revealed increased heterogeneity with higher malignancy grades. So, we proposed the standard deviation of the attenuation coefficient as a physical marker, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas intraoperatively at a threshold. FACT-ROCT even enabled extensive in vivo microvascular imaging of spinal cord tumors, covering 70 mm * 13 mm * 10 mm within 2 minutes. Quantitative vascular tortuosity comparisons confirmed greater tortuosity in higher-grade tumors. The ability to perform extensive vascular imaging and real-time tumor grading during surgery provides critical information for surgical strategy, such as minimizing intraoperative bleeding and optimizing tumor resection while preserving functional tissue.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for radiative transfer with partial frequency redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of exact solutions for radiative transfer in a plane-parallel medium has been addressed by Hemsch and Ferziger in 1972 for a partial frequency redistribution model of the formation of spectral lines consisting in a linear combination of frequency coherent and fully incoherent scattering. The method of solution is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the radiation field, leading to two singular integral equations with a Cauchy-type kernel, that have to be solved one after the other. We reconsider this problem, using as starting point the integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation, where the terms involving the coupling between the two scattering mechanisms are clearly displayed, as well as the primary source of photons. With an inverse Laplace transform, we recover the singular integral equations previously established and with Hilbert transforms, as in the previous work, recast them as boundary value problems in the complex plane. Their solutions are presented in detail for an infinite and a semi-infinite medium. The coupling terms are carefully analyzed and consistency with either the coherent or the incoherent limit is systematically checked. We recover the important results of the previous work that an exact solution exists for an infinite medium, whereas for a semi-infinite medium, which requires the introduction of half-space auxiliary functions, the solution is given by a Fredholm integral equation to be solved numerically. The solutions of the singular integral equations are used to construct explicit expressions providing the radiation field for an arbitrary primary source and for the Green function. An explicit expression is given for the radiation field emerging from a semi-infinite medium.</description>
