      <title>Understanding time-resolved images of AWAKE proton bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article details how images of proton microbunch trains obtained from streak camera measurements may differ from actual microbunch trains inside the plasma, at the plasma exit. We use the same procedure as when comparing simulation results with measurements: create a particle distribution at the plasma exit using particle-in-cell simulations, propagate it to the location of the measurement and add diagnostic apertures and instrument resolution. From comparing distributions, we identify that changes in microbunch divergence and/or dimensions along trains result in differences between the charge distribution in reality and in the measurement. Additionally, we observe that instrument resolution reduces the observed modulation depth, with more reduction for shorter microbunches.</description>

      <title>Intensive gamma-ray light sources based on oriented single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The feasibility of gamma-ray light sources based on the channeling phenomenon of ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons in oriented single crystals is demonstrated using rigorous numerical modeling. Case studies are presented for 10 GeV and sub-GeV $e^{-}/e^{+}$ beams incident on $10^{-1}-10^0$ mm thick diamond and silicon crystals. It is shown that for moderate values of the beam average current ($\lesssim 10$ $\mu$A) the average photon flux in the energy range $10^0-10^2$ MeV emitted within the $10^1-10^3$ $\mu$rad cone and 1 \% bandwidth can be on the level of $10^{10}$ photon/s for electrons and $10^{10}-10^{12}$ photon/s for positrons. These values are higher than the fluxes available at modern laser-Compton gamma ray light sources.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for ID Gap Orbit Distortion Compensation in PETRA III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Undulators are used in storage rings to produce extremely brilliant synchrotron radiation. In the ideal case, a perfectly tuned undulator always has a first and second field integrals equal to zero. But, in practice, field integral changes during gap movements can never be avoided for real-life devices. As they significantly impact the circulating electron beam, there is the need to routinely compensate such effects. Deep Neural Networks can be used to predict the distortion in the closed orbit induced by the undulator gap variations on the circulating electron beam. In this contribution several current state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms were trained on measurements from PETRA~III. The different architecture performances are then compared to identify the best model for the gap-induced distortion compensation.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show experimentally that an effect of motion of ions, observed in a plasma-based accelerator, depends inversely on the plasma ion mass. The effect appears within a single wakefield event and manifests itself as a bunch tail, occurring only when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, experimentally confirmed through variations in the drive bunch charge.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
