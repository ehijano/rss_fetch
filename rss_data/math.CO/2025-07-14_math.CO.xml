      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we classify when (row-strict) dual immaculate functions and (row-strict) extended Schur functions, as well as their skew generalizations, are symmetric. We also classify when their natural variants, termed advanced functions, are symmetric. In every case our classification recovers classical skew Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Exact Biclique Partition number of Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biclique partition number of a graph \(G\), denoted \( \operatorname{bp}(G)\), is the minimum number of biclique subgraphs that partition the edge set of \(G\). The Graham-Pollak theorem states that the complete graph on \( n \) vertices cannot be partitioned into fewer than \( n-1 \) bicliques. In this note, we show that for any split graph \( G \), the biclique partition number satisfies \( \operatorname{bp}(G) = \operatorname{mc}(G^c) - 1 \), where \( \operatorname{mc}(G^c) \) denotes the number of maximal cliques in the complement of \( G \). This extends the celebrated Graham-Pollak theorem to a broader class of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem states that for any sequence of $2n-1$ integers, there exists a subsequence of $n$ elements whose sum is divisible by $n$. In this article, we provide a simple, practical $O(n\log\log n)$ algorithm and a theoretical $O(n\log\log\log n)$ algorithm, both of which improve upon the best previously known $O(n\log n)$ approach. This shows that a specific variant of boolean convolution can be implemented in time faster than the usual $O(n\log n)$ expected from FFT-based methods.</description>

      <title>On 3-terminal positions in Hex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about 3-terminal regions in Hex. A 3-terminal region is a region of the Hex board that is completely surrounded by black and white stones, in such a way that the black boundary stones form 3 connected components. We characterize Hex as the universal planar Shannon game of degree 3. This ensures that every Hex position can be decomposed into 3-terminal regions. We then investigate the combinatorial game theory of 3-terminal regions. We show that there are infinitely many distinct Hex-realizable values for such regions. We introduce an infinite family of 3-terminal positions called superswitches and investigate their properties. We also present a database of Hex-realizable 3-terminal values, and illustrate its utility as a problem-solving tool by giving various applications. The applications include the automated verification of connects-both templates and pivoting templates, a new handicap strategy for $11\times 11$ Hex, and a method for constructing witnesses for the non-inferiority of probes in many Hex templates. These methods allow us to disprove a conjecture by Henderson and Hayward.</description>

      <title>Degree conditions for spanning expansion hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-expansion of a graph $G$ is the $k$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $G$ by adding $k-2$ new vertices to every edge. We determine, for all $k &gt; d \geq 1$, asymptotically optimal $d$-degree conditions that ensure the existence of all spanning $k$-expansions of bounded-degree trees, in terms of the corresponding conditions for loose Hamilton cycles. This refutes a conjecture by Pehova and Petrova, who conjectured that a lower threshold should have sufficed. The reason why the answer is off from the conjectured value is an unexpected `parity obstruction': all spanning $k$-expansions of trees with only odd degree vertices require larger degree conditions to embed. We also show that if the tree has at least one even-degree vertex, the codegree conditions for embedding its $k$-expansion become substantially smaller.</description>

      <title>The Induced Saturation Number for $\mathcal{V}_3$ is Linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a poset $\mathcal{P}$, a family $\mathcal{F}$ of elements in the Boolean lattice is said to be $\mathcal{P}$-saturated if $\mathcal{F}$ does not contain an induced copy $\mathcal P$, but every proper superset of $\mathcal{F}$ contains one. The minimum size of a $\mathcal P$-saturated family in the $n$-dimensional Boolean lattice is denoted by $sat^*(n,\mathcal{P})$. In this paper, we consider the poset $\mathcal V_3$ (the four element poset with one minimal element and three incomparable maximal elements) and show that $sat^*(n,\mathcal{V}_3)\geq \frac{n}{2}$. This represents the first linear lower bound for $sat^*(n,\mathcal{V}_3)$, improving upon the previously best-known bound of $2\sqrt{n}$. Our result establishes that $sat^*(n,\mathcal{V}_3) = \Theta(n)$.</description>

      <title>On the $(k,\ell)$-multiset anonymity measure for social graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The publication of social graphs must be preceded by a rigorous analysis of privacy threats against social graph users. When the threat comes from inside the social network itself, the threat is called an active attack, and the de-facto privacy measure used to quantify the resistance to such an attack is the $(k,\ell)$-anonymity. The original formulation of $(k,\ell)$-anonymity represents the adversary's knowledge as a vector of distances to the set of attacker nodes. In this article, we argue that such adversary is too strong when it comes to counteracting active attacks. We, instead, propose a new formulation where the adversary's knowledge is the multiset of distances to the set of attacker nodes. The goal of this article is to study the $(k,\ell)$-multiset anonymity from a graph theoretical point of view, while establishing its relationship to $(k,\ell)$-anonymity in one hand, and considering the $k$-multiset antiresolving sets as its theoretical frame, in a second one. That is, we prove properties of some graph families in relation to whether they contain a set of attacker nodes that breaks the $(k,\ell)$-multiset anonymity. From a practical point of view, we develop a linear programming formulation of the $k$-multiset antiresolving sets that allows us to calculate the resistance of social graphs against active attacks. This is useful for analysts who wish to know the level of privacy offered by a graph.</description>

      <title>Word-Representability of Split Graphs with Independent Set of Size 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of letters $x$ and $y$ are said to alternate in a word $w$ if, after removing all letters except for the copies of $x$ and $y$ from $w$, the resulting word is of the form $xyxy\ldots$ (of even or odd length) or $yxyx\ldots$ (of even or odd length). A graph $G = (V (G), E(G))$ is word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V(G)$, such that any two distinct vertices $x, y \in V (G)$ are adjacent in $G$ (i.e., $xy \in E(G)$) if and only if the letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. A split graph is a graph in which the vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. Word-representability of split graphs has been studied in a series of papers [2, 5, 7, 9] in the literature. In this work, we give a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization of word-representable split graphs with an independent set of size 4, which is an open problem posed by Kitaev and Pyatkin in [9]</description>

      <title>Bounds on the game isolation number and exact values for paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isolation game is played on a graph $G$ by two players who take turns playing a vertex such that if $X$ is the set of already played vertices, then a vertex can be selected only if it dominates a vertex from a nontrivial component of $G \setminus N_G[X]$, where $N_G[X]$ is the set of vertices in $X$ or adjacent to a vertex in $X$. Dominator wishes to finish the game with the minimum number of played vertices, while Staller has the opposite goal. The game isolation number $\iota_{\rm g}(G)$ is the number of moves in the Dominator-start game where both players play optimally. If Staller starts the game the invariant is denoted by $\iota_{\rm g}'(G)$. In this paper, $\iota_{\rm g}(C_n)$, $\iota_{\rm g}(P_n)$, $\iota_{\rm g}'(C_n)$, and $\iota_{\rm g}'(P_n)$ are determined for all $n$. It is proved that there are only two graphs that attain equality in the upper bound $\iota_{\rm g}(G) \le \frac{1}{2}|V(G)|$, and that there are precisely eleven graphs which attain equality in the upper bound $\iota_{\rm g}'(G) \le \frac{1}{2}|V(G)|$. For trees $T$ of order at least three it is proved that $\iota_{\rm g}(T) \le \frac{5}{11}|V(T)|$. A new infinite family of graphs $G$ is also constructed for which $\iota_{\rm g}(G) = \iota_{\rm g}'(G) = \frac{3}{7}|V(G)|$ holds.</description>

      <title>On Conservative Matrix Fields: Continuous Asymptotics and Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ratios of D-finite sequences and their limits -- known as Ap\'ery limits -- have driven much of the work on irrationality proofs since Ap\'ery's 1979 breakthrough proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$. We extend ratios of D-finite sequences to a high-dimensional setting by introducing the Conservative Matrix Field (CMF). We demonstrate how classical Ap\'ery limits are included by this object as special cases. A useful construction of CMFs is provided, drawing a connection to gauge transformations and to representations of shift operators in finite dimensional modules of Ore algebras. Finally, numerical experiments on these objects reveal surprising arithmetic and dynamical phenomena, which are formulated into conjectures. If established, these conjectures would extend Poincar\'e--Perron asymptotics to higher dimensions, potentially opening the door to optimization-based searches for new irrationality proofs.</description>

      <title>Domino Tilings of the Aztec Diamond in Random Environment and Schur Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of size $M$ in a random environment, where the environment is a one-periodic sequence of i.i.d. random weights attached to domino positions (i.e., to the edges of the underlying portion of the square grid). We consider two cases: either the variance of the weights decreases at a critical scale $1/M$, or the distribution of the weights is fixed. In the former case, the unrescaled fluctuations of the domino height function are governed by the sum of a Gaussian Free Field and an independent Brownian motion. In the latter case, we establish fluctuations on the much larger scale $\sqrt M$, given by the Brownian motion alone.
  To access asymptotic fluctuations in random environment, we employ the method of Schur generating functions. Moreover, we substantially extend the known Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorems for particle systems via Schur generating functions in order to apply them to our setting. These results might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Experimental calculations suggest that the $h$-fold sumset sizes of 4-element sets of integers are concentrated at $h$ numbers that are differences of tetrahedral numbers. In this paper it is proved that these "popular" sumset sizes exist and explicit $h$-adically defined sets are constructed for each of these numbers.</description>

Abstract: Contraction$^*$-depth is a matroid depth parameter analogous to tree-depth of graphs. We establish the matroid analogue of the classical graph theory result asserting that the tree-depth of a graph $G$ is the minimum height of a rooted forest whose closure contains $G$ by proving the following for every matroid $M$ (except the trivial case when $M$ consists of loops and coloops only): the contraction$^*$-depth of $M$ plus one is equal to the minimum contraction-depth of a matroid containing $M$ as a restriction.</description>

      <title>Cokernel statistics for walk matrices of directed and weighted random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The walk matrix associated to an $n\times n$ integer matrix $X$ and an integer vector $b$ is defined by $W := (b,X b, . . . ,X^{n-1} b)$. We study limiting laws for the cokernel of $W$ in the scenario where $X$ is a random matrix with independent entries and $b$ is deterministic. Our first main result provides a formula for the distribution of the $p^{m}$-torsion part of the cokernel, as a group, when $X$ has independent entries from a specific distribution. The second main result relaxes the distributional assumption and concerns the $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module structure.
  The motivation for this work arises from an open problem in spectral graph theory which asks to show that random graphs are often determined up to isomorphism by their (generalized) spectrum. Sufficient conditions for generalized spectral determinacy can namely be stated in terms of the cokernel of a walk matrix. Extensions of our results could potentially be used to determine how often those conditions are satisfied. Some remaining challenges for such extensions are outlined in the paper</description>

      <title>Extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected graph, on four or more vertices, is matching covered (aka 1-extendable) if every edge is present in some perfect matching. An ear decomposition theorem exists for bipartite matching covered graphs due to Hetyei. From the results and proofs of Lov\'asz and Plummer, that rely on Hetyei's theorem, one may deduce that any minimal bipartite matching covered graph has at least $2(m-n+2)$ vertices of degree two (where minimal means that deleting any edge results in a graph that is not matching covered); such a graph is said to be extremal if it attains the stated lower bound.
  In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the class of extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs. In particular, we prove that every such graph $G$ is obtained from two copies of a tree devoid of degree two vertices, say $T$ and $T'$, by adding edges -- each of which joins a leaf of $T$ with the corresponding leaf of $T'$.
  Apart from the aforementioned bound, there are four other bounds that appear in, or may be deduced from, the work of Lov\'asz and Plummer. Each of these bounds leads to a notion of extremality. In this paper, we obtain a complete characterization of all of these extremal classes and also establish relationships between them. Two of our characterizations are in the same spirit as the one stated above. For the remaining two extremal classes, we reduce each of them to one of the already characterized extremal classes using standard matching theoretic operations.
  A connected graph is k-extendable if it has a matching of cardinality $k$ and each such matching extends to a perfect matching. We also discuss bounds proved by Lou (1999) for minimal k-extendable bipartite graphs. We conjecture stronger bounds and provide evidence for our conjectures by constructing tight examples that are straightforward generalizations of the ones that appear in the 1-extendable case.</description>

Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>Total $k$-coalition: bounds, exact values and an application to double coalition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=\big{(}V(G),E(G)\big{)}$ be a graph with minimum degree $k$. A subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a total $k$-dominating set if every vertex in $G$ has at least $k$ neighbors in $S$. Two disjoint sets $A,B\subset V(G)$ form a total $k$-coalition in $G$ if none of them is a total $k$-dominating set in $G$ but their union $A\cup B$ is a total $k$-dominating set. A vertex partition $\Omega=\{V_{1},\ldots,V_{|\Omega|}\}$ of $G$ is a total $k$-coalition partition if each set $V_{i}$ forms a total $k$-coalition with another set $V_{j}$. The total $k$-coalition number ${\rm TC}_{k}(G)$ of $G$ equals the maximum cardinality of a total $k$-coalition partition of $G$. In this paper, the above-mentioned concept are investigated from combinatorial points of view. Several sharp lower and upper bounds on ${\rm TC}_{k}(G)$ are proved, where the main emphasis is given on the invariant when $k=2$. As a consequence, the exact values of ${\rm TC}_2(G)$ when $G$ is a cubic graph or a $4$-regular graph are obtained. By using similar methods, an open question posed by Henning and Mojdeh regarding double coalition is answered. Moreover, ${\rm TC}_3(G)$ is determined when $G$ is a cubic graph.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.

      <title>All generalized rose window graphs are hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bicirculant is a regular, $d$-valent graph that admits a semiregular automorphism of order $m$ having two vertex-orbits of size $m$. The vertices of each orbit induce a circulant graph of order $m$ and the remaining edges span a regular bipartite graph of valence, say $s$, $1 \leq s \leq d$, connecting the two vertex-orbits. Generalized Petersen graphs constitute a prominent family of bicirculants, with $d = 3$ and $s = 1$. In 1983, Brian Alspach proved that all generalized Petersen graphs are hamiltonian, except for the family $G(m, 2)$ with $m\equiv 5\pmod 6$. In this paper we conjecture that among all connected bicirculants of valence at least 2, there are no other exceptions. It follows from various sources that the conjecture is true for all cubic bicirculants. In this paper we prove the conjecture for quartic bicirulants with $s = 2$, also known as the generalized rose window graphs. As a consequence we obtain that every connected bicirculant with $s \ge 3$ is hamiltonian if $m$ is a product of at most three prime powers. In particular, every connected bicirculant with $s \ge 3$ is hamiltonian for even $m&lt;210$ and odd $m &lt; 1155$.</description>

      <title>Factorizations in Hecke algebras I: long cycle factorizations and Jucys-Murphy elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a permutation, there is a well-developed literature studying the number of ways one can factor it into a product of other permutations subject to certain conditions. We initiate the analogous theory for the type A Iwahori-Hecke algebra by generalizing the notion of factorization in terms of the Jucys-Murphy elements. Some of the oldest and most foundational factorization results for the symmetric groups pertain to the long cycle. Our main results give q-deformations of these long cycle factorizations and reveal q-binomial, q-Catalan, and q-Narayana numbers along the way.</description>

      <title>On the Visibility Polynomial of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G(V,E) be a simple graph and let X subset of V. Two vertices u and v are said to be X-visible if there exists a shortest u,v-path P such that V(P) intersection X is a subset of {u, v}. A set X is called a mutual-visibility set of G if every pair of vertices in X are X-visible. The visibility polynomial of a graph G is defined as nu (G)=sum_{i &gt;= 0} r_i x^i, where r_i denotes the number of mutual-visibility sets in G of cardinality i. In the present paper, the visibility polynomial is studied for some well-known classes of graphs. In particular, the instance at which the number of maximal mutual-visibility sets is equal for cycle graphs is identified. The visibility polynomial of the join of two graphs is studied. The algorithm for computing the visibility polynomial of a graph has been identified to have a time complexity of O(n^3.2^n) making the problem computationally intensive for larger graphs.</description>

      <title>Counting with two-level polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine combinatorial counting functions with two parameters, $n$ and $q$. For fixed $q$, these functions are (quasi-)polynomial in $n$. As $q$ varies, the degree of this polynomial is itself polynomial in $q$, as are the leading coefficients. We carefully define these two-level polynomials, lay out their basic algebraic properties, and provide a schema for showing a function is a two-level polynomial. Using the schema, we prove that a variety of counting functions arising in different areas of combinatorics are two-level polynomials. These include chromatic polynomials for many infinite families of graphs, partitions of an integer into a given number of parts, placing non-attacking chess pieces on a board, Sidon sets, and Sheffer sequences (including binomial type and Appell sequences).</description>

      <title>Determinantal random subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two families of determinantal random spanning subgraphs of a finite connected graph, one supported by acyclic spanning subgraphs (spanning forests) with fixed number of connected components, the other by connected spanning subgraphs with fixed number of independent cycles. Each family generalizes the uniform spanning tree and the generating functions of these probability measures generalize the classical Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials.
  We call Symanzik spanning forests the elements of the acyclic spanning subgraphs family, and single out a particular determinantal mixture of these, having as kernel a normalized Laplacian on $1$-forms, which we call the Laplacian spanning forest.
  Our proofs rely on a set of integral and real or complex (which we call geometric) multilinear identies involving cycles, coboundaries, and forests on graphs. We prove these identities using classical pieces of the algebraic topology of graphs and the exterior calculus applied to finite determinantal point processes, both of which we treat in a self-contained way.
  We emphasize the matroidal nature of our constructions, thereby showing how the above two families of random spanning subgraphs are dual to one another, as well as possible generalisations.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>
