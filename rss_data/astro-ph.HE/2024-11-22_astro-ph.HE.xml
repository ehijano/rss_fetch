      <title>A Unified Model of Kilonovae and GRBs in Binary Mergers Establishes Neutron Stars as the Central Engines of Short GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand the theoretical framework by Gottlieb el al. (2023), which connects binary merger populations with long and short binary gamma-ray bursts (lbGRBs and sbGRBs), incorporating kilonovae as a key diagnostic tool. We show that lbGRBs, powered by massive accretion disks around black holes (BHs), should be accompanied by bright, red kilonovae. In contrast, sbGRBs - if also powered by BHs - would produce fainter, red kilonovae, potentially biasing against their detection. However, magnetized hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants that precede BH formation can produce jets with power ($P_{\rm NS} \approx 10^{51}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) and Lorentz factor ($\Gamma&gt;10$), likely compatible with sbGRB observations, and would result in distinctly bluer kilonovae, offering a pathway to identifying the sbGRB central engine. Recent modeling by Rastinejad et al. (2024) found luminous red kilonovae consistently accompany lbGRBs, supporting lbGRB originating from BH-massive disk systems, likely following a short-lived HMNS phase. The preferential association of sbGRBs with comparably luminous kilonovae argues against the BH engine hypothesis for sbGRBs, while the bluer hue of these KNe provides additional support for an HMNS-driven mechanism. Within this framework, BH-NS mergers likely contribute exclusively to the lbGRB population with red kilonovae. Our findings suggest that GW170817 may, in fact, have been an lbGRB to on-axis observers. Finally, we discuss major challenges faced by alternative lbGRB progenitor models, such as white dwarf-NS or white dwarf-BH mergers and accretion-induced collapse forming magnetars, which fail to align with observed GRB timescales, energies, and kilonova properties.</description>

      <title>Pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources: modeling the thermal emission and polarization properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are enigmatic sources first discovered in the 1980s in external galaxies. They are characterized by their extraordinarily high X-ray luminosity, which often exceeds $10^{40}\, \rm{erg \; s^{-1}}$. Our study aims to obtain more information about pulsating ULXs (PULXs), first of all, their viewing geometry, since it affects almost all the observables, such as the flux, the pulsed fraction, the polarization degree (PD), and polarization angle (PA). We present a simplified model, which primarily describes the thermal emission from an accreting, highly magnetized neutron star, simulating the contributions of an accretion disk and an accretion envelope surrounding the star magnetosphere, both described by a multicolor blackbody. Numerical calculations are used to determine the flux, PD, and PA of the emitted radiation, considering various viewing geometries. The model predictions are then compared to the observed spectra of two PULXs, M51 ULX-7 and NGC 7793 P13. We identified the best fitting geometries for these sources, obtaining values of the pulsed fraction and the temperature at the inner radius of the disk compatible with those obtained from previous works. We also found that measuring the polarization observables can give considerable additional information on the source.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova (KN) detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new KNe. For this purpose, we simulate GW events assuming a data-driven, GW-motivated distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). For our particular case of estimating KN detection rates in the O4 and O5 runs, we map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the optical light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. We use the simulated population of KNe to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore KN detectability as a function of mass, distance, and spin of the binaries. Out of the mergers that produce a KN in our simulations, we expect detectable KNe for DECam-like instruments at a per-year rate of: $1-16$ ($0-1$) for BNS (NSBH) in O4, and $16-165$ ($1-12$) for BNS (NSBH) in O5, using a fiducial exposure time and conditional on the uncertainty on the equation of state (EOS) and volumetric rates of the mergers. Taking into account observability constraints, our scheduler covers the location of the KN $\sim 30-38\%$ of the times for our fiducial EOS. We provide the depths needed to detect a significant fraction of our simulated mergers for the astronomical community to use in their follow-up campaigns.</description>

      <title>Radiation mechanism of twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations in neutron star low mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The connection between quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and magnetic fields has been investigated across various celestial bodies. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves have been employed to explain the simultaneous upper and lower kilohertz (kHz) QPOs. Nevertheless, the intricate and undefined formation pathways of twin kHz QPOs present a compelling avenue for exploration. This area of study holds great interest as it provides an opportunity to derive crucial parameters related to compact stars. Aims:We strives to develop a self-consistent model elucidating the radiation mechanism of twin kHz QPOs, subsequently comparing it with observations. Methods: A sample of 28 twin kHz QPOs observed from the X-ray binary 4U 1636--53 are used to compare with the results of the MCMC calculations according to our model of the radiation mechanism of twin kHz QPOs, which is related to twin MHD waves. Results: We obtain twenty-eight groups of parameters of 4U 1636--53 and a tight exponential fit between the flux and the temperature of seed photons to Compton up-scattering and find that the electron temperature in the corona around the neutron star decreases with the increasing temperature of the seed photons. Conclusions: The origin of twin kHz QPOs can be attributed to dual disturbances arising from twin MHD waves generated at the innermost radius of an accretion disc. The seed photons can be transported through a high temperature corona and Compton up-scattered. The variability of the photons with the frequencies of twin MHD waves can lead to the observed twin kHz QPOs.</description>

      <title>Compton scattering in the optically thick uniform spherical corona around the neutron star in an X-ray binary in two conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Compton scattering in the optically thick uniform spherical corona around a neutron star in an X-ray binary. In the scattering, the low energy seed photons (0.1 - 2.5 keV) are scattered in low energy electrons (2.5 - 10 keV) in the corona in two conditions, i.e. initial seed photons are scattered in a whole corona and scattered in every layer of the corona that are supposed to be divided into many layers.When the same number of input seed photons, the same corona parameters and the same energy distribution of all photons in the two conditions are considered, the approximately same number of output photons can be obtained, which means that there is approximately a transform invariance of layering the Comptonized corona. Thus the scattering in the layers of a multi-layered corona is approximately equal to the scattering in the whole corona by dividing the whole corona into several layers.It means that Compton scattering for the initial seed photons scattered in a whole optically thick spherical corona with uniformly distributed electrons also can be considered as that the multiple Compton scatterings take place in the layers of a multi-layered corona in order approximately, which can be used to explore some physical process in one part of a corona.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of the knee in the cosmic ray energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knee-like structure around 4 PeV is the most striking feature in the cosmic ray energy spectrum, whose origin remains enigmatic. We propose a novel concept of the total logarithmic mass energy spectrum to characterize the knee, taking into account LHAASO measurements of the all-particle energy spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass. The predominant role of proton in the knee formation is unearthed. The case of a mass-dependent knee is ruled out with a significance of 22.9${\sigma}$ and the rigidity-dependent knee feature is revealed. An ankle-like structure stemming from the excess of iron is discovered at 9.7${\pm}$ 0.2 PeV with a significance of 25.9${\sigma}$. Our findings pierce the mist of the puzzling knee for the first time since its discovery.</description>

      <title>Reverse Shock Emission from Misaligned Structured Jets in Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively discussed in the context of shocks generated during an interaction of relativistic outflows with their ambient medium. This process leads to the formation of both a forward and a reverse shock. While the emission from the forward shock, observed off-axis, has been well-studied as a potential electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave-detected merger, the contribution of the reverse shock is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of the reverse shock to the GRB afterglows observed off-axis. In our analysis, we consider jets with different angular profiles, including two-component jets, power-law structured jets, Gaussian jets and 'mixed jets' featuring a Poynting-flux-dominated core surrounded by a baryonic wing. We apply our model to GRB 170817A/GW170817 and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to obtain model parameters. Our findings suggest that the reverse shock emission can significantly contribute to the early afterglow. In addition, our calculations indicate that the light curves observable in future off-axis GRBs may exhibit either double peaks or a single peak with a prominent feature, depending on the jet structure, viewing angle and micro-physics shock parameters.</description>

      <title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as an example to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various Kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the Kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between GW and FRB.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or non-repeaters. However, observational limitations may lead to misclassifications, suggesting a larger proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalog, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and HDBSCAN), we successfully segregate repeaters and non-repeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}T_B$, and $r - \gamma$ correlations, which provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Binarity of Massive Black Holes in the Galactic Center and Some Nearby Galaxies via Pulsar Timing Array Observations of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black holes (MBHs) exist in the Galactic center (GC) and other nearby galactic nuclei. As natural outcome of galaxy mergers, some MBHs may have a black hole (BH) companion. In this paper, assuming that the MBHs in the GC and some nearby galaxies are in binaries with orbital periods ranging from months to years (gravitational-wave frequency $\sim1-100$\,nHz), we investigate the detectability of gravitational-waves from these binary MBHs (BBHs) and constraints on the parameter space for the existence of BBHs in the GC, LMC, M31, M32, and M87, that may be obtained by current/future pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We find that a BBH in the GC, if any, can be revealed by the Square Kilometer Array PTA (SKA-PTA) if its mass ratio $q\gtrsim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ and semimajor axis $a\sim20-10^3$\,AU. The existence of a BH companion of the MBH can be revealed by SKA-PTA with $\sim20$-year observations in M31 if $q\gtrsim10^{-4}$ and $a\sim10^2-10^4$\,AU or in M87 if $q\gtrsim10^{-5}$ and $a\sim10^3-2\times10^4$\,AU, but not in LMC and M32 if $q\ll1$. If a number of milli-second stable pulsars with distances $\lesssim0.1-1$\,pc away from the central MBH in the GC, LMC, M32, or M31, can be detected in future and applied to PTAs, the BH companion with mass even down to $\sim100M_\odot$, close to stellar masses, can be revealed by such PTAs. Future PTAs are expected to provide an independent way to reveal BBHs and low-mass MBH companions in the GC and nearby galaxies, improving our understandings of the formation and evolution of MBHs and galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Hadronic Code Comparison for Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\pm 40\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Examining the evolution of the Supersoft X-ray Source RX J$0513.9-6951$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) are thought to be accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems, with thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. The SSS RX J$0513.9-6951$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibits cyclic variations between optical low and high states, which are anti-correlated with its X-ray flux. This behaviour is believed to result from the periodic expansion and contraction of the WD due to variations in the accretion rate in the system. We analyse eight high-resolution XMM and six grating Chandra spectra of RX J$0513.9-6951$ with our grid of model atmosphere spectra of hot WDs computed under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our aim is to test a contraction model of the source variability by tracking the evolution of the WD properties. The used grid of hot WD model atmospheres spans a wide range of effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}=100-1000\,\rm kK$ in steps of $25\,\rm kK$) and eight values of surface gravity $\log g$. The LMC chemical composition was assumed. The obtained fitting parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, and bolometric luminosity $L$) evolve on the $T_{\rm eff}- \log g$ and $T_{\rm eff}- L$ planes. This evolution follows the model tracks of WDs with masses of $1.05-1.15\,M_{\odot}$ and thermonuclear burning on the surface. The analysis has showed that the optical brightness of the system is lower when the WD is larger, more luminous, and more effectively illuminates the accretion disc. These results contradict the contraction model, which predicts the opposite behaviour of the source. We use a model, that assumes that the far UV/soft X-ray flux is reprocessed into the optical band due to multiple scattering in the cloud system above the accretion disc. More significant illumination can lead to rarefying of the cloud slab, thereby reducing the reprocessing efficiency and making the source fainter in the optical band.</description>

      <title>On the Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-frequency emission from an accretion disk around a black hole is broadened into a line profile due to gravitational redshift and the motion of the disk's particles relative to the observer. The ensemble of relativistically broadened emission frequencies from the disk elements forms the spectrum viewed by an observer. Over the past decades, the broadened spectra of accreting systems have been used to constrain the spin of the black hole, the observer's inclination, and the astrophysical model parameters of the system. These inferences are usually made under the assumption that the accretion disk consists of particles orbiting around the black hole on stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane. Under this Standard disk model, in this work, we revisit line profile morphology, i.e., its extent, kinks, and fall-off. We provide a unified analytical explanation for these line profile morphological features, which encode the black hole spin, viewing inclination, and locations of the disk's inner and outer edges. We then show that these features, however, are model-dependent, by parametrically relaxing some of the astrophysical assumptions. In particular, we explore how allowing the disk particles to deviate from stable circular orbits rapidly degenerates the characteristic features of the line profile under the Standard disk model. Our results further demonstrate how sensitive our understanding of black hole and system properties can be to assumptions we make when interpreting these types of measurements.</description>

      <title>Cooling of neutron stars in soft X-ray transients with realistic crust composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal radiation of neutron stars in soft X-ray transients (SXTs) in a quiescent state is believed to be powered by the heat deposited in the stellar crust due to nuclear reactions during accretion. Confronting observations of this radiation with simulations helps to verify theoretical models of the dense matter in neutron stars. We simulate the thermal evolution of the SXTs with theoretical models of the equation of state and composition of the accreted crust. The new family of such models were recently developed within a thermodynamically consistent approach by modeling the nuclear evolution of an accreted matter as it sinks toward the stellar center, starting from representative thermonuclear ash compositions. The crust cooling curves computed with the traditional and modern theory are compared with observations of SXTs MXB 1659-29 and IGR J17480-2446. We show that the new and traditional models of the accreted neutron star crusts are similar in their capability to explain the thermal evolution of neutron stars in SXTs. Both kinds of models require inclusion of additional ingredients not supplied by the current theory, such as the shallow heating and variation of thermal conductivity, to fit observations.</description>

      <title>Individual Neutrino Masses From a Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nearby supernova will carry an unprecedented wealth of information about astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. Because supernova are fundamentally neutrino driven phenomenon, our knowledge about neutrinos -- particles that remain quite elusive -- will increase dramatically with such a detection. One of the biggest open questions in particle physics is related to the masses of neutrinos. Here we show how a galactic supernova provides information about the masses of each of the three mass eigenstates \emph{individually}, at some precision, and is well probed at JUNO. This information comes from several effects including time delay and the physics within the supernova. The time delay feature is strongest during a sharp change in the flux such as the neutronization burst; additional information may also come from a QCD phase transition in the supernova or if the supernova forms a black hole. We consider both standard cases as dictated by local oscillation experiments as well as new physics motivated scenarios where neutrino masses may differ across the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can give precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third generation network.</description>

      <title>Unique and Universal Effects of Oscillation in Eccentric Orbital Binary Black Hole Mergers beyond Orbital Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 192 sets of binary black hole merger data in eccentric orbits obtained from RIT, decomposing the radiation energy into three distinct phases through time: inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown. Our investigation reveals a universal oscillatory behavior in radiation energy across these phases, influenced by varying initial eccentricities. From a post-Newtonian perspective, we compare the orbital average of radiation energy with the non-orbital average during the inspiral phase. Our findings indicate that the oscillatory patterns arise from non-orbital average effects, which disappear when orbital averaging is applied. This orbital effect significantly impacts the mass, spin, and recoil velocity of the merger remnant, with its influence increasing as the initial eccentricity rises. Specifically, in the post-Newtonian framework, the amplitudes of oscillations for mass, spin, and recoil velocity at ${e_t}_0 = 0.5$ (initial temporal eccentricity of PN) are enhanced by approximately 10, 5, and 7 times, respectively, compared to those at ${e_t}_0 = 0.1$. For a circular orbit, where ${e_t}_0 = 0.0$, the oscillations vanish entirely. These findings have important implications for waveform modeling, numerical relativity simulations, and the characterization of binary black hole formation channels.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Buchdahl's limit: A surgeon's guide to compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as described by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find matter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their compactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the so-called Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that, under a few assumptions, static fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly have. We highlight two of the main assumptions that could be violated in physically realistic situations: i) isotropy and ii) an outward-decreasing monotonicity of the density profile, which, as we discuss in detail, can be understood as a form of energy condition. We construct a pair of toy models that exemplify how the Buchdahl limit can be overcome if any of these two assumptions is individually relaxed. In particular, we show that relaxing the monotonicity assumption alone yields a new, less restrictive compactness limit as long as the energy density is not allowed to become negative. If negative energies are permitted, the compactness of these toy models can be as close to the black hole limit as desired. We also discuss how these toy models represent some of the main features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more refined models.</description>

      <title>Y Gem, a Symbiotic Star Outshined by its Asymptotic Giant Branch Primary Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A considerable number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission indicative of the presence of a binary companion. AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine their companions, making almost impossible their identification. Y Gem has been known to be a far-UV- and X-ray-bright AGB star for some decades now, but the nature of its companion, whether it is a main-sequence star or a white dwarf (WD) in a symbiotic system (SySt), is disputed. Our goal is to uncover the true nature of Y Gem to help us peer into the possible misidentified population of SySts. Multi-wavelength IR, optical, UV and X-ray observations have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in Y Gem. In particular, an optical spectrum of Y Gem is presented here for the first time, while X-ray data are interpreted by means of reflection models produced by an accretion disk and material in its vicinity. The optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to narrow recombination and forbidden emission lines. The presence of the emission lines and the analysis of the extinction-corrected UV spectrum suggest a hot component with $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$60,000 K, $L$=140 L$_{\odot}$, and $R$=0.11 R$_{\odot}$, very likely an accreting WD. The late component is found to be an 1.1 M$_\odot$ AGB star with $T_\mathrm{eff}$=3350 K and $R$=240 R$_\odot$. Using IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data, we found that Y Gem is a S-type SySt whose compact component is accreting at an estimated mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}=2.3\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At such accretion rate, the accreting WD has reached the stable and steady burning phase where no recurrent events are expected.</description>

      <title>Magnetar emergence in a peculiar gamma-ray burst from a compact star merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central engine that powers gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most powerful explosions in the universe, is still not identified. Besides hyper-accreting black holes, rapidly spinning and highly magnetized neutron stars, known as millisecond magnetars, have been suggested to power both long and short GRBs. The presence of a magnetar engine following compact star mergers is of particular interest as it would provide essential constraints on the poorly understood equation of state for neutron stars. Indirect indications of a magnetar engine in these merger sources have been observed in the form of plateau features present in the X-ray afterglow light curves of some short GRBs. Additionally, some X-ray transients lacking gamma-ray bursts (GRB-less) have been identified as potential magnetar candidates originating from compact star mergers. Nevertheless, smoking gun evidence is still lacking for a magnetar engine in short GRBs, and the associated theoretical challenges have been raised. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the broad-band prompt emission data of a peculiar, very bright GRB 230307A. Despite its apparently long duration, the prompt emission and host galaxy properties are consistent with a compact star merger origin, as suggested by its association with a kilonova. Intriguingly, an extended X-ray emission component shows up as the $\gamma$-ray emission dies out, signifying the likely emergence of a magnetar central engine. We also identify an achromatic temporal break in the high-energy band during the prompt emission phase, which was never observed in previous bursts and reveals a narrow jet with half opening angle of approximately $\sim 3.4^\circ (R_{GRB}/10^{15}~{cm})^{-1/2}$, where $R_{GRB}$ is the GRB prompt emission radius.</description>

      <title>Binary vision: The merging black hole binary mass distribution via iterative density estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave (GW) emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference on formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio $q$, and/or assumed a universal $q$ distribution regardless of primary mass. Kernel density estimation (KDE)-based methods allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent with both power laws and with a constant function of $q$. We find a weaker preference for near-equal mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own "spectral lines" at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anti-correlation between primary and secondary masses around the ~$10M_\odot$ peak.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star mergers with massive neutron stars in numerical relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the merger of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in numerical relativity, focusing on the properties of the remnant disk and the ejecta, varying the mass of compactness of the NS and the mass and spin of the BH. We find that within the precision of our numerical simulations, the remnant disk mass and ejecta mass normalized by the NS baryon mass ($\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$, respectively), and the cutoff frequency $f_{\rm{cut}}$ normalized by the initial total gravitational mass of the system at infinite separation approximately agree among the models with the same NS compactness $C_{\rm{NS}}=M_{\rm{NS}}/R_{\rm{NS}}$, mass ratio $Q=M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\rm{NS}}$, and dimensionless BH spin $\chi_{\rm{BH}}$ irrespective of the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ in the range of $1.092$--$1.691\,M_\odot$. This result shows that the merger outcome depends sensitively on $Q$, $\chi_{\rm BH}$, and $C_{\rm{NS}}$ but only weekly on $M_{\rm{NS}}$. This justifies the approach of studying the dependence of NS tidal disruptions on the NS compactness by fixing the NS mass but changing the EOS. We further perform simulations with massive NSs of $M_{\rm{NS}}=1.8M_{\odot}$, and compare our results of $\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$ with those given by existing fitting formulas to test their robustness for more compact NSs. We find that the fitting formulas obtained in the previous studies are accurate within the numerical errors assumed, while our results also suggest that further improvement is possible by systematically performing more precise numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube neutrino telescope has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, but the sources of this flux have largely remained elusive. Using the 10-year IceCube public dataset, we search for correlations between neutrino events and tracers of large-scale structure (LSS). We conduct a combined cross-correlation analysis using several wide-area galaxy catalogs spanning a redshift range of z = 0.1 to z ~ 2.5 as well as maps of the cosmic infrared background. We do not detect a definitive signal, but find tantalizing hints of a potential positive correlation between neutrinos and the tracers of LSS. We additionally construct a simple model to interpret galaxy-neutrino cross-correlations in terms of the redshift distribution of neutrino sources. We put upper limits on the clustering amplitude of neutrinos based on the measured cross-correlations with galaxies and forecast the improvements on these constraints that can be obtained using future detectors. We show that, in the future, neutrino-galaxy cross-correlations should be a powerful probe to constrain properties of neutrino source populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope at an unprecedent angular resolution of $\sim$18''. We newly found that the CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ = 55.7-62.2 km s$^{-1}$ (60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud with an expansion velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$, which is thought to be formed by the pre-and/or post-supernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/HI absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ $\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$. Given that the previously measured pre-shock density is $\sim$2-5 cm$^{-3}$, the expanding motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was likely formed by the pre-supernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.</description>

Abstract: Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of $10^{38\sim39}$ erg/s. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circum-nuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow-diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2$c\sim0.6$$c$, the total mass of $10^{-3}\sim10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are $0.1\sim1$ pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe discovery of EP J005245.1-722843: a rare BeWD binary in the Small Magellanic Cloud?</title>

Abstract: On May 27 2024, the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) mission detected enhanced X-ray emission from a new transient source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) during its commissioning phase. Prompt follow-up with the EP Follow-up X-ray Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope and NICER have revealed a very soft, thermally emitting source (kT$\sim$0.1 keV at the outburst peak) with an X-ray luminosity of $L\sim4\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, labelled EP J005245.1-722843. This super-soft outburst faded very quickly in a week time. Several emission lines and absorption edges were present in the X-ray spectrum, including deep Nitrogen (0.67 keV) and Oxygen (0.87 keV) absorption edges. The X-ray emission resembles the SSS phase of typical nova outbursts from an accreting white dwarf (WD) in a binary system, despite the X-ray source being historically associated with an O9-B0e massive star exhibiting a 17.55 days periodicity in the optical band. The discovery of this super-soft outburst suggests that EP J005245.1-722843 is a BeWD X-ray binary: an elusive evolutionary stage where two main-sequence massive stars have undergone a common envelope phase and experienced at least two episodes of mass transfer. In addition, the very short duration of the outburst and the presence of Ne features hint at a rather massive, i.e., close to the Chandrasekhar limit, Ne-O WD in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor instabilities appear to be omnipresent in dense astrophysical environments, thus presenting a challenge to large-scale simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers (NSMs). Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on "fast" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors.</description>

      <title>DiscoTEX 1.0: Discontinuous collocation and implicit-turned-explicit (IMTEX) integration symplectic, symmetric numerical algorithms with higher order jumps for differential equations I: numerical black hole perturbation theory applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac $\delta-$ distributionally sourced differential equations emerge in many dynamical physical systems from machine learning, finance, neuroscience, and seismology to black hole perturbation theory. These systems lack exact analytical solutions and are thus best tackled numerically. We describe a generic numerical algorithm which constructs discontinuous spatial and temporal discretisations by operating on discontinuous Lagrange and Hermite interpolation formulae, respectively. By solving the distributionally sourced wave equation, possessing analytical solutions, we demonstrate that numerical weak-form solutions can be recovered to high-order accuracy by solving a first-order reduced system of ODEs. The method-of-lines framework is applied to the \texttt{DiscoTEX} algorithm i.e. through \underline{dis}continuous \underline{co}llocation with implicit\underline{-turned-explicit} integration methods which are symmetric and conserve symplectic structure. Furthermore, the main application of the algorithm is proved by calculating the amplitude at any desired location within the numerical grid, including at the position (and at its right and left limit) where the wave- (or wave-like) equation is discontinuous via interpolation using \texttt{DiscoTEX}. This is demonstrated, firstly by solving the wave- (or wave-like) equation and comparing the numerical weak-form solution to the exact solution. We further demonstrate how to reconstruct the gravitational metric perturbations from weak-form numerical solutions of a non-rotating black hole, which do not have known exact analytical solutions, and compare them against state-of-the-art frequency domain results. We conclude by motivating how \texttt{DiscoTEX}, and related numerical algorithms, both open a promising new alternative waveform generation route for modelling highly asymmetric binaries and complement current frequency domain methods.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>QCD topology and axion properties in an isotropic hot and dense medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD topology and axion properties at finite temperature and chemical potential in the framework of the two-flavor Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model. We find that the behaviors of the two lowest cumulants of the QCD topological charge distribution and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition. In particular, the topological susceptibility and the axion mass follow the response of the chiral condensate to temperature and chemical potential, showing that both quantities decrease monotonically with the increment of temperature and/or chemical potential. However, it is important to note that the normalized fourth cumulant behaves differently depending on the temperature. At low temperatures, it is a non-monotonic function of the chemical potential, while at high temperatures, it monotonically decreases. Additionally, its value invariably approaches the asymptotic value of $b_2^{\text {inst }}=-1/12$, predicted by the dilute instanton gas model. We also observe that with the increase in chemical potential at relatively low temperatures, the axion self-coupling constant exhibits a sharp peak around the critical point, which can even be more than twice its vacuum value. After that, the self-coupling drops sharply to a much lower value than its vacuum value, eventually approaching zero in the high chemical potential limit. The finding that the axion self-coupling constant is significantly enhanced in high-density environments near the chiral phase transition could lead to the creation or enhancement of an axion Bose-Einstein condensate in compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Bursty Star Formation in Dwarfs is Sensitive to Numerical Choices in Supernova Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the {\small SMUGGLE} stellar feedback model, we compute idealized simulations of a $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{10} \, \msun$ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 3$. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the non-linear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic equation of state with a momentum dependent interaction and neutron star structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of free quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated semi-coherent hierarchical search for stellar-mass binary inspiral signals in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes with LISA remains a challenging open problem. Conventional template-bank approaches to the search are impossible due to the prohibitive number of templates that would be required. This paper continues the development of a hierarchical semi-coherent stochastic search, extending it to a full end-to-end pipeline that is then applied to multiple mock LISA data streams which include simulated noise. Particle swarm optimization is used as a stochastic search algorithm, tracking multiple maxima of a semi-coherent search statistic defined over source parameter space. The pipeline is accelerated by the use of graphical processing units (GPUs). No prior information from observations by ground-based detectors is used; this is necessary in order to provide advance warning of the merger. We find that the pipeline is able to detect sources with signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\rho\sim 17$, we demonstrate that these searches can directly seed coarse parameter estimation in cases where the search trigger is loud. An example of how the false-alarm probability can be estimated for this type of GW search is also included.</description>
