      <title>Nested Symmetric Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven algorithm to design rate- and length-flexible polar codes. While the algorithm is very general, a particularly appealing use case is the design of codes for automorphism ensemble decoding (AED), a promising decoding algorithm for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) applications. To this end, theoretic results on nesting of symmetric polar codes are derived, which give hope in finding a fully nested, rate-compatible sequence suitable for AED. Using the proposed algorithms, such a flexible polar code design for automorphism ensemble successive cancellation (SC) decoding is constructed, outperforming existing code designs for AED and also the 5G polar code under cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-aided successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Angle Map-based Beam Alignment for RIS-aided mmWave Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been widely used to enhance the performance of millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, making beam alignment more challenging. To ensure efficient communication, this paper proposes a novel intelligent angle map-based beam alignment scheme for both general user equipments (UEs) and RIS-aided UEs simultaneously in a fast and effective way. Specifically, we construct a beam alignment architecture that utilizes only angular information. To obtain the angle information, the currently hottest seq2seq model - the Transformer - is introduced to offline learn the relationship between UE geographic location and the corresponding optimal beam direction. Based on the powerful machine learning model, the location-angle mapping function, i.e., the angle map, can be built. As long as the location information of UEs is available, the angle map can make the acquisition of beam alignment angles effortless. In the simulation, we utilize a ray-tracing-based dataset to verify the performance of the proposed scheme. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can achieve high-precision beam alignment and remarkable system performance without any beam scanning.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Ensemble Decoding Methods for Short Length LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To alleviate the suboptimal performance of belief propagation (BP) decoding of short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, a plethora of improved decoding algorithms has been proposed over the last two decades. Many of these methods can be described using the same general framework, which we call ensemble decoding: A set of independent constituent decoders works in parallel on the received sequence, each proposing a codeword candidate. From this list, the maximum likelihood (ML) decision is designated as the decoder output. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare different realizations of the ensemble decoder, namely multiple-bases belief propagation (MBBP), automorphism ensemble decoding (AED), scheduling ensemble decoding (SED), noise-aided ensemble decoding (NED) and saturated belief propagation (SBP). While all algorithms can provide gains over traditional BP decoding, ensemble methods that exploit the code structure, such as MBBP and AED, typically show greater performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Computation with quantum Reed-Muller codes and their mapping onto 2D atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a fault tolerant construction for error correction and computation using two punctured quantum Reed-Muller (PQRM) codes. In particular, we consider the $[[127,1,15]]$ self-dual doubly-even code that has transversal Clifford gates (CNOT, H, S) and the triply-even $[[127,1,7]]$ code that has transversal T and CNOT gates. We show that code switching between these codes can be accomplished using Steane error correction. For fault-tolerant ancilla preparation we utilize the low-depth hypercube encoding circuit along with different code automorphism permutations in different ancilla blocks, while decoding is handled by the high-performance classical successive cancellation list decoder. In this way, every logical operation in this universal gate set is amenable to extended rectangle analysis. The CNOT exRec has a failure rate approaching $10^{-9}$ at $10^{-3}$ circuit-level depolarizing noise.
  Furthermore, we map the PQRM codes to a 2D layout suitable for implementation in arrays of trapped atoms and try to reduce the circuit depth of parallel atom movements in state preparation. The resulting protocol is strictly fault-tolerant for the $[[127,1,7]]$ code and practically fault-tolerant for the $[[127,1,15]]$ code. Moreover, each patch requires a permutation consisting of $7$ sub-hypercube swaps only. These are swaps of rectangular grids in our 2D hypercube layout and can be naturally created with acousto-optic deflectors (AODs).
  Lastly, we show for the family of $[[2^{2r},{2r\choose r},2^r]]$ QRM codes that the entire logical Clifford group can be achieved using only permutations, transversal gates, and fold-transversal gates.</description>

      <title>Advancing Free-Space Optical Communication System Architecture: Performance Analysis of Varied Optical Ground Station Network Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study discusses the current state of FSO technology, as well as global trends and developments in the industrial ecosystem to identify obstacles to the full realization of optical space-to-ground communication networks. Additionally, link performance and network availability trade-off studies are presented, comparing overall system performance between portable and large OGS networks in conjunction with a constellation of small low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The paper provides an up-to-date overview and critical analysis of the FSO industry and assesses the feasibility of low-cost portable terminals as an alternative to larger high-capacity OGS systems. This initiative aims to better inform optical communications stakeholders, including governments, academic institutions, satellite operators, manufacturers, and communication service providers</description>

      <title>Focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of a variant of sunflowers, Alon and Holzman recently introduced focal-free hypergraphs. In this paper, we show that there is an interesting connection between the maximum size of focal-free hypergraphs and the renowned Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture on the maximum number of edges that can be contained in a uniform hypergraph with bounded matching number. As a consequence, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on the maximum sizes of focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes, thereby significantly improving the previous results of Alon and Holzman. Moreover, by using the existentce results of combinatorial designs and orthogonal arrays, we are able to explicitly determine the exact sizes of maximum focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes for a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>An Information Criterion for Controlled Disentanglement of Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities. By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose Disentangled Self-Supervised Learning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that DisentangledSSL successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data.</description>

      <title>More global randomness from less random local gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture. In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.</description>

      <title>Fast Rate Information-theoretic Bounds on Generalization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalization error of a learning algorithm refers to the discrepancy between the loss of a learning algorithm on training data and that on unseen testing data. Various information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error have been derived in the literature, where the mutual information between the training data and the hypothesis (the output of the learning algorithm) plays an important role. Focusing on the individual sample mutual information bound by Bu et al., which itself is a tightened version of the first bound on the topic by Russo et al. and Xu et al., this paper investigates the tightness of these bounds, in terms of the dependence of their convergence rates on the sample size $n$. It has been recognized that these bounds are in general not tight, readily verified for the exemplary quadratic Gaussian mean estimation problem, where the individual sample mutual information bound scales as $O(\sqrt{1/n})$ while the true generalization error scales as $O(1/n)$. The first contribution of this paper is to show that the same bound can in fact be asymptotically tight if an appropriate assumption is made. In particular, we show that the fast rate can be recovered when the assumption is made on the excess risk instead of the loss function, which was usually done in existing literature. A theoretical justification is given for this choice. The second contribution of the paper is a new set of generalization error bounds based on the $(\eta, c)$-central condition, a condition relatively easy to verify and has the property that the mutual information term directly determines the convergence rate of the bound. Several analytical and numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of these bounds.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Streaming Codes for Messages with Different Decoding Delays in Channel with Burst and Random Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a real-time transmission scenario, messages are transmitted through a channel that is subject to packet loss. The destination must recover the messages within the required deadline. In this paper, we consider a setup where two different types of messages with distinct decoding deadlines are transmitted through a channel model that introduces either one burst erasure of length at most $B$, or $N$ random erasures in any fixed-sized sliding window. The message with a short decoding deadline $T_{\mathrm{u}}$ is referred to as an urgent message, while the other one with a decoding deadline $T_{\mathrm{v}}$ ($T_{\mathrm{v}} &gt; T_{\mathrm{u}}$) is referred to as a less urgent message.
  We consider the scenario where $T_{\mathrm{v}} &gt; T_{\mathrm{u}} + B$ and propose a non-trivial achievable region $\mathcal{R}$ for the aforementioned channel model. We propose a novel merging approach to encode two message streams of different urgency levels into a single flow and present explicit constructions for encoding, contributing to the establishment of the achievability of region $\mathcal{R}$. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that this region encompasses the rate pairs of existing encoding schemes and coincides with the capacity region in burst channel scenarios. Lastly, we investigate the property of the achievable region $\mathcal{R}$, proving that it is the largest one obtained from all the rate pairs under the merging method.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15108v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give answer to an argument trying to show the divergence of Assembly Theory from LZ compression. We formally proved that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) is equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP/PNG via LZ compression. We show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defence against the proof that the assembly index calculation method is an LZ scheme, is based on an incomplete and misleading experiment. When the experiment is completed and conducted properly, the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident and aligned with the proof previously offered. Therefore, this completes both the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of object repetitions `to arrive at a measure for life', is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse' defence argument against compression does not withstand basic scrutiny, and that their empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, nota special feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a special case of our BDM introduced almost a decade earlier and that arguments attributing special stochastic properties to Ai are misleading, not unique, and exactly the same than those that Shannon Entropy is already not only equipped with but designed for which we have also proven to be equivalent to Ai making AT redundant even in practice when applied to their own experimental data.</description>
