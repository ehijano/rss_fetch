      <title>Quantitative Spectral Stability for an Embedded Annulus under Coupled Curve Shortening and $2$D Ricci Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of Dirichlet eigenvalues on an embedded annulus whose boundary evolves by curve shortening flow while the ambient surface evolves under the two dimensional Ricci flow using variational formulas, Rellich--type identities, and harmonic capacity methods, we relate eigenvalue variations to geometric deficit and modulus. We establish quantitative bounds comparing the spectrum of the evolving annulus with that of a flat cylinder of equal modulus. As a consequence, we obtain geometric stability and a spectral gap estimate controlled by the deficit functional.</description>

      <title>Capillary Orlicz-Minkowski flow in the upper half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long-time existence and asymptotic behavior of an anisotropic capillary Gauss curvature flow. By studying this flow and proving its convergence to a stationary solution, we establish a new existence result for the capillary Orlicz-Minkowski problem without the evenness assumption, and provide a flow approach to the existence of smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>Urysohn width and macroscopic scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the macroscopic version of Gromov's Urysohn width conjecture for scalar curvature is false in dimensions four and above. This is based on (1) a novel estimate on the codimension two Urysohn width of circle bundles over manifolds with large hypersphericity radius, and (2) a notion of ruling for Riemannian manifolds that yields circle bundles with total spaces admitting metrics of positive macroscopic scalar curvature. Along the way, we also show that Urysohn width is not continuous under Cheeger-Gromov collapsing limits. This article is a continuation of our study of metric invariants and scalar curvature for circle bundles over large Riemannian manifolds initiated in [KS25].</description>

      <title>The Enclosed Volume for Periodic Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general formula for the enclosed volume of constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces in Euclidean three space with translational periods forming a lattice. The formula relates the volume to the surface area, a Wess-Zumino-Witten-type term, and a newly defined curvature term of the associated family of flat connections, thereby extending the classical Minkowski formula for closed CMC surfaces. Interpreting the volume as a gauge-invariant quantity, we apply the result to a variety of examples and provide explicit computations. As an application, we construct a counterexample to the isoperimetric problem in $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$, disproving the conjecture that minimizers are restricted to spheres, cylinders, or pairs of planes.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Riemannian Algebraic Ricci Solitons on Four-Dimensional Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which pseudo-Riemannian inner products induce pseudo-Riemannian algebraic Ricci solitons on four-dimensional Lie algebras. By analyzing the algebraic Ricci soliton equation for each four-dimensional Lie algebra, we obtain a complete description of when such pseudo-Riemannian algebraic Ricci solitons arise in dimension four. We present two applications of our formalism on a chosen four-dimensional Lie algebra by exhibiting a pseudo-Riemannian algebraic Ricci soliton and a flat pseudo-Riemannian inner product, which is a trivial algebraic Ricci soliton.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have found some features of $\ast$- Ricci Bourguignon Soliton on Kenmotsu manifold. We estimated the conditions for $\ast$-Ricci Bourguignon on Kenmotsu manifold to be compressing, balancing or enlarging accordingly. We have found some curvature properties of Kenmotsu manifold admitting $\ast$-Ricci Bourguignon Soliton. Additionally, we have featured $\ast$-Ricci Bourguignon on Kenmotsu manifold with torse-forming vector field. Finally, we proved an example of $5$-dimensional Kenmotsu manifold on $\ast$-Ricci Bourguignon Soliton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an extension of the noncompact version of Llarull's theorem due to Zhang and Li-Su-Wang-Zhang, giving an upper bound for the infimum of scalar curvature in terms of the bottom spectrum of the Laplacian. Moreover, we extend the theorem to manifolds with boundary, relaxing the strict positivity condition on the scalar curvature near the boundary that was required by Liu-Liu. Our approach is based on deformed Dirac operators.</description>

      <title>Second Robin eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operators on Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma^2,ds^2)$ be a compact Riemannian surface, possibly with boundary, and consider Schr\"odinger-type operators of the form $L=\Delta+V-aK$ together with natural Robin and Steklov-type boundary conditions incorporating a boundary potential $W$ and (in the curvature-corrected setting) the geodesic curvature $\kappa_g$ of $\partial\Sigma$. Our main contribution is a geometric upper bound for the second Robin eigenvalue in terms of the topology of $\Sigma$ and the integrals of $V$ and $W$, obtained via a Hersch balancing argument on the capped surface. As a geometric application, we derive sharp topological restrictions for compact two-sided free boundary minimal surfaces of Morse index at most one inside geodesic balls of negatively curved pinched Cartan--Hadamard $3$-manifolds under a mild radius condition. We also prove complementary upper bounds for first eigenvalues in the closed and Robin settings, including rigidity in the curvature-corrected case, and we establish Steklov-type estimates in a coercive regime where the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is well defined for all boundary data.</description>

      <title>Random infinite ideal angled graphs and ideal hyperbolic polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to develop the uniformization and boundary theory of random infinite ideal hyperbolic polyhedra (abbr. IHP) and their dual 1-skeleton, i.e., ideal angled graphs (abbr. IAG) from multiple perspectives, including combinatorics, geometry, analysis and random walks. For unimodular random IAG, we establish an ICP analog of the dichotomy theorem of Angel-Hutchcroft-Nachmias-Ray [4,5]. Specifically, the character $T(\rho):=\sum_{e\ni\rho}\Theta_e$ of an IAG, introduced in [40], determines its ICP type: the graph is a.s. ICP-parabolic if and only if $\mathbb{E}[T(\rho)]=2\pi$. In the ICP-hyperbolic case, the simple random walk converges a.s. to $\partial\mathbb{D}$ with positive hyperbolic speed. Moreover, the geometric, Poisson, Martin, and Gromov boundaries coincide, extending the boundary theory of Angel-Barlow-Gurevich-Nachmias [3] and Hutchcroft-Peres [37] beyond triangulations to cellular decompositions. As a corollary of the aforementioned IHP/IAG duality, we obtain the systematic characterizations of the random IHP. To develop our theory, we strengthen and refine the Ring Lemma of Ge-Yu-Zhou [27] for ICP, which provides quantitative local control of the packing geometry. This key estimate makes it possible to extend the boundary theory beyond triangulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and duality on a wide class of metric spaces, and uniqueness results on any connected, complete Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary, for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters. In particular, this is the first and only uniqueness result with no restriction on the geometry of the manifold aside from connectedness and completeness. We obtain these via the corresponding results for barycenter problems associated to a new two-parameter family of metrics on probability measures on a general metric fiber bundle, called the $\textit{disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$ (previously introduced by the authors).</description>

      <title>On the Bergman metric of symmettric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bounded domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ whose Bergman metric is locally symmetric, i.e. its Riemannian curvature tensor is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. Following the strategy developed in \cite{UnifThm2}, we obtain two rigidity results. If the Bergman metric of $\Omega$ is complete, then $\Omega$ is (globally) symmetric. If instead $\Omega$ is pseudoconvex, then $\Omega$ is biholomorphic to $\widetilde\Omega\setminus E$, where $\widetilde\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ is a bounded symmetric domain and $E\subset\widetilde\Omega$ is relatively closed and pluripolar. The proofs combine the structure theory of Hermitian symmetric spaces with Calabi's theory of K\"ahler immersions into the infinite dimensional complex projective space (in particular, rigidity and the hereditary property of the diastasis), together with analytic and pluripotential tools based on extension properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions and the Bergman kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish general bounds on the topology of free boundary minimal surfaces obtained via min-max methods in compact, three-dimensional ambient manifolds with mean convex boundary. We prove that the first Betti number is lower semicontinuous along min-max sequences converging in the sense of varifolds to free boundary minimal surfaces. In the orientable case, we obtain an even stronger result which implies that if the number of boundary components increases in the varifold limit, then the genus decreases at least as much. We also present several compelling applications, such as the variational construction of a free boundary minimal trinoid in the Euclidean unit ball.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ denote a closed surface with constant mean curvature in $\mathbb{G}^3$, a 3-dimensional Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant metric. For such surfaces, there is a harmonic Gauss map which maps values to the unit sphere within the Lie algebra of $\mathbb{G}$. We prove that the energy index of the Gauss map of $\Sigma$ is bounded below by its topological genus. We also obtain index estimates in the case of complete non compact surfaces.</description>

      <title>On orthogonal decompositions of hermitian Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hermitian Higgs bundle is a triple $({\mathfrak E},h) = (E,\Phi, h)$, where ${\mathfrak E}=(E,\Phi)$ is a Higgs bundle and $(E,h)$ is a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle. It is well-known that several results on holomorphic vector bundles extend to the Higgs bundles setting, although this is not always the case. In this article we show that some classical propositions, involving orthogonal decompositions of holomorphic hermitian vector bundles and the second fundamental form of its holomorphic subbundles, can be extended to hermitian Higgs bundles. The extended propositions concerning orthogonal decompositions have immediate applications in Higgs bundles, and we mention some of these throughout the article. Moreover, the extended propositions concerning the second fundamental form are generalizations of previously known results on Higgs bundles. In particular, here we include alternative proofs of these extended propositions without using local computations. Finally, as an application of the above results and due to the lack of a certain parallelism condition, we show that a classical theorem concerning the Kobayashi functional for holomorphic vector bundles does not admit a straightforward extension to Higgs bundles.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on non-compact Euclidean submanifolds: sharpness and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to provide Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on complete, not necessarily compact $n$-dimensional submanifolds $\Sigma$ of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n+m}$. Our first result, stated for $p=2$, is sharp, it is valid on general submanifolds, and it involves the mean curvature of $\Sigma$. It implies in particular the main result of S. Brendle [Comm. Pure Appl. Math.}, 2022]. In addition, it turns out that equality can only occur if and only if $\Sigma$ is isometric to the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n}$ and the extremizer is a Gaussian. The second result is a general $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequality for $p\geq 2$ on Euclidean submanifolds with constants that are codimension-free in case of minimal submanifolds. In order to prove the above results - especially, to deal with the equality cases - we elaborate the theory of optimal mass transport on submanifolds between measures that are not necessarily compactly supported. Applications are provided to sharp hypercontractivity estimates of Hopf-Lax semigroups on submanifolds. The first hypercontractivity estimate is for general submanifolds with bounded mean curvature vector, the second one is for self-similar shrinkers endowed with the natural Gaussian measure. The equality cases are characterized here as well.</description>

We introduce horizontal magnetic flows starting from magnetic potential one-forms, proving that the flow depends only on the Rumin differential of the potential. Notably, in dimension three the Rumin differential acts on one-forms as a second-order differential operator.
  We further prove that such magnetic flows can be interpreted as a geodesic flow on a suitably lifted sub-Riemannian structure, which is of Engel type when the magnetic field is non-vanishing. In the general case, when the magnetic field may vanish, we analyze the geometry of the lifted structure, characterizing its step and abnormal trajectories in terms of the analytical properties of the magnetic field.
  Our work is inspired by the classical correspondence, first observed by Montgomery, between Riemannian magnetic flows and sub-Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Green's function estimates for compact K\"ahler manifolds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works of Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm established for compact K\"ahler manifolds (even for K\"ahler spaces of specific singularities) a variety of geometric estimates depending on an upper bound of $L^{1+\epsilon}$ or $L^1(\log L)^{n+\epsilon}$ norms of the volume density but not on any curvature bound, in which a key ingredient is a uniform integral estimate for Green's function. Motivated by their results and further applications, in this paper we shall prove an improved (nearly optimal) integral estimate for Green's function under $L^{1+\epsilon}$ volume density condition, and then apply it to obtain improved global geometric estimates. For instance, one of our results states that the $k$th eigenvalue of Laplacian operator $\lambda_k\ge c\cdot k^{\frac{1}{n}}(\log k)^{-3}$, where $n$ is the complex dimension of the K\"ahler manifold and $c$ depends on $n$ and $L^{1+\epsilon}$ norm of the volume density. Also, our results can be applied to the long-time or volume-noncollapsing finite-time K\"ahler-Ricci flow on compact K\"ahler manifolds and to a general K\"ahler family to further extend previous works of Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm, Guedj-T\^o and Vu.</description>

      <title>Ray structures on Teichm\"uller Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there may be many Thurston metric geodesics between a pair of points in Teichm\"uller space, we find that by imposing an additional energy minimization constraint on the geodesics, thought of as limits of harmonic map rays, we select a unique Thurston geodesic through those points. Extending the target surface to the Thurston boundary yields, for each point $Y$ in Teichm\"uller space, an \enquote{exponential map} of rays from that point $Y$ onto Teichm\"uller space with visual boundary the Thurston boundary of Teichm\"uller space.
  We first depict harmonic map ray structures on Teichm\"uller space as a geometric transition between Teichm\"uller ray structures and Thurston geodesic ray structures. In particular, by appropriately degenerating the source of a harmonic map between hyperbolic surfaces (along \enquote{harmonic map dual rays}), the harmonic map rays through the target converge to a Thurston geodesic; by appropriately degenerating the target of the harmonic map, those harmonic map dual rays through the domain converge to Teichm\"uller geodesics. We then extend this transition to one from Teichm\"uller disks through Hopf differential disks to stretch-earthquake disks. These results apply to surfaces with boundary, resolving a question on stretch maps between such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of the Thurston metric on Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the Thurston (asymmetric) metric on Teichm\"uller space, the defect from being uniquely geodesic is described by the envelope, defined as the union of geodesics from the initial point to the terminal point.
  Using the harmonic stretch lines we defined recently, we describe the shape of envelopes as a cone over a cone over a space, defined from a topological invariant of the initial and terminal points. In addition, we show that the envelope is always contractible. We prove that envelopes vary continuously with their endpoints. We also provide a parametrization of out-envelopes and in-envelopes in terms of straightened measured laminations complementary to the prescribed maximally stretched laminations.
  We extend most of these results to the metrically infinite envelopes which have a terminal point on the Thurston boundary, illustrating some of the nuances of these with examples, and describing the accumulation set. Finally, we develop a new characterization of harmonic stretch lines that avoids a limiting process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the modulus of continuity of solutions to Dirichlet problems for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations with $L^p$ densities on Stein spaces with isolated singularities. In particular, we prove such solutions are H\"older continuous outside singular points if the boundary data is H\"older continuous.</description>

      <title>A synthetic Lorentzian Cartan-Hadamard theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a synthetic Lorentzian Cartan-Hadamard theorem. This result both transfers the corresponding statement for locally convex metric spaces established by S. Alexander and R. Bishop to the Lorentzian setting, and simultaneously generalizes the smooth Lorentzian theorem discussed by J. Beem and P. Ehrlich to the recently established framework of synthetic Lorentzian geometry. Our approach is based on an appropriate notion of local concavity for Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces, which allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of timelike geodesics between any pair of timelike related points under the additional assumptions of global hyperbolicity and future one-connectedness. We also provide a globalization result for our notion of concavity in the setting of Lorentzian length spaces, and apply our results to obtain a globalization statement for nonnegative upper timelike curvature bounds.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Deformations of Hyperbolicity Notions on Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate deformation properties of balanced hyperbolicity, with particular emphasis on degenerate balanced manifolds and their behavior under modifications.
  In this context, we introduce two new notions of hyperbolicity for compact non-K\"ahler manifolds $X$ of complex dimension $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}X=n$ in degree $1 \leq p \leq n-1$, inspired by the work of F. Haggui and S. Marouani on $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity. The first notion, called \emph{p-SKT hyperbolicity}, generalizes the notions of SKT hyperbolicity and Gauduchon hyperbolicity introduced by S. Marouani. The second notion, called \emph{p-HS hyperbolicity}, extends the notion of sG hyperbolicity defined by Y. Ma.
  We investigate the relationship between these notions of analytic nature and their geometric counterparts, namely Kobayashi hyperbolicity and \emph{p-cyclic hyperbolicity} for $2 \leq p \leq n-1$, and we examine the openness under holomorphic deformations of both $p$-HS hyperbolicity and $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity.</description>
