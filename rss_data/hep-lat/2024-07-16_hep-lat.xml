      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of (1+1)-dimensional U(1) gauge-Higgs model at $\theta=\pi$ with L\"uscher's admissibility condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the (1+1)-dimensional U(1) gauge-Higgs model with a $\theta$ term, where the U(1) gauge action is constructed with L\"uscher's admissibility condition. Using the tensor renormalization group, both the complex action problem and topological freezing problem in the standard Monte Carlo simulation are avoided. We find the first-order phase transition with sufficiently large Higgs mass at $\theta=\pi$, where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. On the other hand, the symmetry is restored with a sufficiently small mass. We determine the critical endpoint as a function of the Higgs mass parameter and show the critical behavior is in the two-dimensional Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Confining strings in three-dimensional gauge theories beyond the Nambu--Got\=o approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of the effective bosonic string describing confining flux tubes in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories in three spacetime dimensions. While their low-energy properties are known to be universal and are described well by the Nambu--Got\=o action, a non-trivial dependence on the gauge group is encoded in a series of undetermined subleading corrections in an expansion around the limit of an arbitrarily long string. We quantify the first two of these corrections by means of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of Polyakov-loop correlators in the lattice regularization. We compare the results of novel lattice simulations for theories with $N=3$ and $6$ color charges, and report an improved estimate for the $N=2$ case, discussing the approach to the large-$N$ limit. Our results are compatible with analytical bounds derived from the S-matrix bootstrap approach. In addition, we also present a new test of the Svetitsky--Yaffe conjecture for the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ theory in three dimensions, finding that the lattice results for the Polyakov-loop correlation function are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Svetitsky--Yaffe mapping, which are worked out quantitatively applying conformal perturbation theory to the three-state Potts model in two dimensions. The implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Collins-Soper kernel: Chiral quarks and Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs), i.e. the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, employing the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMD formalism as well as a chiral-symmetry preserving lattice discretization. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted using the domain wall fermion discretization scheme, a fine lattice spacing of approximately 0.08 fm, and physical values for light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is determined analyzing the ratios of pion quasi-TMD wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) perturbative accuracy. Thanks to the absence of Wilson-lines, the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF demonstrates a remarkably slower decay of signals with increasing quark separations. This allows us to access the non-perturbative CS kernel up to transverse separations of 1 fm. For small transverse separations, our results agree well with perturbative predictions. At larger transverse separations, our non-perturbative CS kernel clearly favors certain global fits.</description>

      <title>High precision calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the muon anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new lattice QCD calculation of the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$. We reduce uncertainties compared to our earlier computation by $40\%$, arXiv:2002.12347. We perform simulations on finer lattices allowing for an even more accurate continuum extrapolation. We also include a small, long-distance contribution obtained using input from experiments in a low-energy regime where they all agree. Combined with other standard model contributions our result leads to a prediction that differs from the measurement of $a_\mu$ by only 0.9 standard deviations. This provides a remarkable validation of the standard model to 0.37ppm.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric polarizabilities and nucleon-pion scattering at physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon electric polarizabilities at the physical pion mass. Our findings reveal the substantial contributions of the $N\pi$ states to these polarizabilities. Without considering these contributions, the lattice results fall significantly below the experimental values, consistent with previous lattice studies. This observation has motivated us to compute both the parity-negative $N\pi$ scattering up to a nucleon momentum of $\sim0.5$ GeV in the center-of-mass frame and corresponding $N\gamma^*\to N\pi$ matrix elements using lattice QCD. Our results confirm that incorporating dynamic $N\pi$ contributions is crucial for a reliable determination of the polarizabilities from lattice QCD. This methodology lays the groundwork for future lattice QCD investigations into various other polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>The radiative decay of scalar glueball from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice QCD study on the radiative decay of the scalar glueball to the vector meson $\phi$ in the quenched approximation. The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation. We first revisit the radiative $J/\psi$ decay into the scalar glueball $G$ and obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma(J/\psi \to \gamma G)=0.578(86)~\text{keV}$ and the branching fraction $\text{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma G) = 6.2(9)\times 10^{-3}$. We then extend the similar calculation to the process $G\to \gamma \phi$ and get the partial decay width $\Gamma(G \to \gamma \phi)= 0.074(47)~\text{keV}$, which implies that the combined branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\gamma G\to \gamma\gamma\phi$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ such that this process is hardly detected by the BESIII experiment even with the large $J/\psi$ sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$. With the vector meson dominance model, the two-photon decay width of the scalar glueball is estimated to be $\Gamma(G\to\gamma\gamma)=0.53(46)~\text{eV}$, which results in a large stickiness $S(G)\sim \mathcal{O}(10^4)$ of the scalar glueball by assuming the stickiness of $f_2(1270)$ to be one.</description>

      <title>Towards Unpolarized GPDs from Pseudo-Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the unpolarized isovector proton generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $H^{u-d}(x, \xi, t)$ and $E^{u-d}(x, \xi, t)$ in the pseudo-distribution formalism using distillation. Taking advantage of the large kinematic coverage made possible by this approach, we present results on the moments of GPDs up to the order $x^3$ -- including their skewness dependence -- at a pion mass $m_\pi = 358$ MeV and a lattice spacing $a = 0.094$ fm.</description>

      <title>Present and future of CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the present state and planned updates of CosmoLattice, a cutting-edge code for lattice simulations of non-linear dynamics of scalar-gauge field theories in an expanding background. We first review current capabilities of the code, including the simulation of interacting singlet scalars and of Abelian and non-Abelian scalar-gauge theories. We also comment on new features recently implemented, such as the simulation of gravitational waves from scalar and gauge fields. Secondly, we discuss new extensions of CosmoLattice that we plan to release publicly. On the one hand, we comment on new physics modules, which include axion-gauge interactions $\phi F \widetilde{F}$, non-minimal gravitational couplings $\phi^2 R$, creation and evolution of cosmic defect networks, and magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD). On the other hand, we discuss new technical features, including evolvers for non-canonical interactions, arbitrary initial conditions, simulations in 2+1 dimensions, and higher accuracy spatial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Three-particle formalism for multiple channels: the $\eta \pi \pi + K \overline K \pi$ system in isosymmetric QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize previous three-particle finite-volume formalisms to allow for multiple three-particle channels. For definiteness, we focus on the two-channel $\eta \pi \pi$ and $K \overline K \pi$ system in isosymmetric QCD, considering the positive $G$ parity sector of the latter channel, and neglecting the coupling to modes with four or more particles. The formalism we obtain is thus appropriate to study the $b_1(1235)$ and $\eta(1295)$ resonances. The derivation is made in the generic relativistic field theory approach using the time-ordered perturbation theory method. We study how the resulting quantization condition reduces to that for a single three-particle channel when one drops below the upper ($K\overline K \pi$) threshold. We also present parametrizations of the three-particle K matrices that enter into the formalism.</description>

      <title>Experimental lower bounds on entanglement entropy without twin copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a it $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We show several examples for which, in good approximation, $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ with a constant of proportionality slightly larger than one. We argue that one should have the inequality $S_{A}^{vN}\geq(2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ holding in more general circumstances. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of the Field Correlator Method (FCM) is discussed, with applications to the most interesting areas of QCD physics obtained in the lattice data and experiment. These areas include: a) the connection of colorelectric confinement with the basic quark and gluon condensates; b) the explicit form of the colorelectric deconfinement at a growing temperature $T$; c) the theory of the colormagnetic confinement at all temperatures; d) the theory of strong decays, the theory of pdf and jets in the instantaneous formalism with confinement. We demonstrate that the FCM with instantaneous formalism and confinement (instead of the light cone formalism and pure perturbation theory) can provide the way to the theory of QCD, which helps to describe world data without phenomenological parameters.</description>
