      <title>On the Voigt profile and its dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Voigt profile is the density obtained from the convolution of a Gaussian and a Cauchy and it is widely used in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. We show that the Voigt profile is a scale mixture of Gaussian distributions, with mixing Levy distribution. A consequence of this result is that there exists a dual of the Voigt distribution, which is itself a normal scale mixture. Both the Dual Voigt and its mixing are transformations, via truncation and reflection, of the Normal and Levy random variables. We discuss the dual Voigt characteristics, propose algorithms for parameter estimation and outline further developments.</description>

      <title>Value-at-Risk, Tail Value-at-Risk and upper tail transform of the sum of two counter-monotonic random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Value-at-Risk (VaR) of comonotonic sums can be decomposed into marginal VaR's at the same level. This additivity property allows to derive useful decompositions for other risk measures. In particular, the Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR) and the upper tail transform of comonotonic sums can be written as the sum of their corresponding marginal risk measures. The other extreme dependence situation, involving the sum of two arbitrary counter-monotonic random variables, presents a certain number of challenges. One of them is that it is not straightforward to express the VaR of a counter-monotonic sum in terms of the VaR's of the marginal components of the sum. This paper generalizes the results derived in Chaoubi et al. (2020) by providing decomposition formulas for the VaR, TVaR and the stop-loss transform of the sum of two arbitrary counter-monotonic random variables.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems.
  In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions is a typical example of stochastic log-gas. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>The speed of biased random walks among dynamical random conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study biased random walks on dynamical random conductances on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We analyze three models: the Variable Speed Biased Random Walk (VBRW), the Normalized VBRW (NVBRW), and the Constant Speed Biased Random Walk (CBRW). We prove positivity of the linear speed for all models and investigate how the speed depends on the bias $\lambda$. Notably, while the CBRW speed increases for large $\lambda$, the NVBRW speed can asymptotically decrease even in uniformly elliptic conductances. The results for NVBRW generalize the results proved for biased random walks on dynamical percolation in [1].</description>

      <title>Propagation of Singularities for the Damped Stochastic Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $1+1$ dimensional damped stochastic Klein-Gordon equation, we show that random singularities associated with the law of the iterated logarithm exist and propogate in the same way as the stochastic wave equation. This provides evidence for possible connections to microlocal analysis, ie. the exact regularity and singularities described in this paper should admit wavefront set type descriptions whose propagation is determined by the highest order terms of the linear operator. Despite the results being exactly the same as those of the wave equation, our proofs are significantly different than the proofs for the wave equation. Miraculously, proving our results for the critically damped equation implies them for the general equation, which significantly simplifies the problem. Even after this simplification, many important parts of the proof are significantly different than (and we think are more intuitive from the PDE viewpoint compared to) existing proofs for the wave equation.</description>

      <title>Surface sums in two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills: Cancellations and explicit computation for general loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills theory, we perform a refined study of the surface sums defined in the companion work [BCSK24]. In this setting, the surface sums are a priori expected to exhibit significant simplifications, because two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory is a special model admitting many known exact formulas. Thus, a natural problem is to understand these simplifications directly from the perspective of the surface sums. Towards this goal, we develop a key new tool, in the form of a surface exploration algorithm (or "peeling process") which at each step carefully selects the next edge to explore. Using this algorithm, we manage to find many cancellations in the surface sums, thereby obtaining a detailed understanding of precisely which surfaces remain after cancellation. As a consequence, we obtain many new explicit formulas for Wilson loop expectations of general loops in the large-$N$ limit of lattice Yang--Mills in two dimensions and prove a convergence result for the empirical spectral measure of any simple loop.</description>

      <title>The Fourier coefficients of the critical holomorphic multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holomorphic multiplicative chaos (HMC) is a holomorphic analogue of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos. It arises naturally as the limit in large matrix size of the characteristic polynomial of Haar unitary matrices, and more generally, random matrices following the Circular-$\beta$-Ensemble. In a previous article, Najnudel, Paquette and Simm prove that in the $L^2$ phase $\beta &gt; 4$, the appropriately normalized Fourier coefficient of the HMC converges in distribution to the square root of the total mass of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit circle, multiplied by an independent complex normal random variable. This convergence has been extended to the $L^1$ phase by Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu. In the present article, we prove that this convergence further extends to the critical case $\beta = 2$, which corresponds to the limiting coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Circular Unitary Ensemble. We also prove the joint convergence of consecutive Fourier coefficients, and we derive convergence in distribution of the secular coefficients of the Circular Unitary Ensemble with index growing sufficiently slowly with the dimension.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral formula for the Hermite polynomials: Combinatorics, Asymptotics and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hermite polynomials are ubiquitous but can be difficult to work with due to their unwieldy definition in terms of derivatives. To remedy this, we showcase an underappreciated Gaussian integral formula for the Hermite polynomials, which is especially useful for generalizing to multivariable Hermite polynomials. Taking this as our definition, we prove many useful consequences, including: 1. Combinatorial interpretations for the Hermite polynomials, including a proof of orthogonality. 2. A more elementary proof of Plancherel--Rotach asymptotics that does not involve residues. 3. Limit theorems for GUE random matrices and Dyson's Brownian motion, including bulk convergence to the semi-circle law and edge convergence to the Airy limit/Tracy-Widom law. 4. Elementary derivations of Edgeworth expansions and multivariable Edgeworth expansions. This article is primarily expository and features many illustrative figures.</description>

      <title>Exponential Ergodicity for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with Singular Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\in (d,\infty]$ and consider the $k*$-distance $$\|\mu-\nu\|_{k*}:= \sup\Big\{|\mu(f)-\nu(f)|:\ f\in\B_b(\R^d),\ \|f\|_{\tt L^k}:=\sup_{x\in \R^d}\|1_{B(x,1)}f\|_{L^k}\le 1\Big\}$$ between probability measures on $\R^d$. The exponential ergodicity in $1$-Wasserstein and $k*$ distances is derived for a class of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with small singular interactions measured by $\|\cdot\|_{k*}.$ Moreover, the exponential ergodicity in $2$-Wasserstein distance and relative entropy is derived when the interaction term is given by
  $$b^{(0)}(x,\mu) :=\int_{\R^d}h(x-y)\mu(\d y)$$ for some measurable function $h:\R^d\to\R^d$ with small $\|h\|_{\tt L^k}$.</description>

      <title>Unified Modelling of Infrastructure Asset Performance Deterioration -- a bounded gamma process approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure asset management systems require a flexible deterioration model that can handle various degradation patterns in a unified way. Owing to its appealing monotonic sample paths, independent increments and mathematical tractability, gamma process has been widely employed as an infrastructure performance deterioration model. This model was recently enhanced by introducing an upper bound to satisfy a practical modelling need that many infrastructure performance deterioration processes are constrained by physical or managerial limits. Several bounded transformed gamma process (BTGP) alternatives had been proposed; however, they lacked due flexibility to characterize different deterioration patterns. This paper proposed a new BTGP model that is deeply grounded upon the traditional regression modelling tradition in infrastructure asset management systems. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were carried out between the proposed BTGP and a bounded nonstationary gamma process (BNGP) model from both deterioration modelling and asset management decision-making perspectives. An empirical study using the real-world historical bridge condition data was performed to examine the flexibility of the BTGP against the BNGP and six other BTGP alternatives. The results confirmed the flexibility and significance of the proposed BTGP model for infrastructure systems.</description>

      <title>Online Stochastic Packing with General Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in studying online stochastic packing under more general correlation structures, motivated by the complex data sets and models driving modern applications. Several past works either assume correlations are weak or have a particular structure, have a complexity scaling with the number of Markovian "states of the world" (which may be exponentially large e.g. in the case of full history dependence), scale poorly with the horizon $T$, or make additional continuity assumptions. Surprisingly, we show that for all $\epsilon$, the online stochastic packing linear programming problem with general correlations (suitably normalized and with sparse columns) has an approximately optimal policy (with optimality gap $\epsilon T$) whose per-decision runtime scales as the time to simulate a single sample path of the underlying stochastic process (assuming access to a Monte Carlo simulator), multiplied by a constant independent of the horizon or number of Markovian states. We derive analogous results for network revenue management, and online bipartite matching and independent set in bounded-degree graphs, by rounding. Our algorithms implement stochastic gradient methods in a novel on-the-fly/recursive manner for the associated massive deterministic-equivalent linear program on the corresponding probability space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sampling and Moment Estimation for Transformed Gaussian Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for efficiently sampling transformed Gaussian random fields on $d$-dimensional domains, based on an enhanced version of the classical moving average method. Pointwise transformations enforcing boundedness are essential for using Gaussian random fields in quantum computation and arise naturally, for example, in modeling coefficient fields representing microstructures in partial differential equations. Generating this microstructure from its few statistical parameters directly on the quantum device bypasses the input bottleneck. Our method enables an efficient quantum representation of the resulting random field and prepares a quantum state approximating it to accuracy $\mathtt{tol} &gt; 0$ in time $\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{polylog} \mathtt{tol}^{-1})$. Combined with amplitude estimation and a quantum pseudorandom number generator, this leads to algorithms for estimating linear and nonlinear observables, including mixed and higher-order moments, with total complexity $\mathcal{O}(\mathtt{tol}^{-1} \operatorname{polylog} \mathtt{tol}^{-1})$. We illustrate the theoretical findings through numerical experiments on simulated quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Random positive linear operators and their applications to nonparametric statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a general procedure on how to apply random positive linear operators in nonparametric estimation. As a consequence, we give explicit confidence bands and intervals for a distribution function $F$ concentrated on $[0,1]$ by means of random Bernstein polynomials, and for the derivatives of $F$ by using random Bernstein-Kantorovich type operators. In each case, the lengths of such bands and intervals depend upon the degree of smoothness of $F$ or its corresponding derivatives, measured in terms of appropriate moduli of smoothness. In particular, we estimate the uniform distribution function by means of a random polynomial of second order. This estimator is much simpler and performs better than the classical uniform empirical process used in the celebrated Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and small time asymptotics of stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equations with damping on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equations model turbulence phenomena, and are given by $$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}-\mu \mathrm{div}\left(\left(1+|\nabla\boldsymbol{u}|^2\right)^{\frac{p-2}{2}}\nabla\boldsymbol{u}\right)+(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}+\nabla p=\boldsymbol{f}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0,$$ for $p\geq 2.$ In this work, we consider the stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equations with the damping $\alpha\boldsymbol{u}+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}|^{r-2}\boldsymbol{u},$ for $r\geq 2$ ($\alpha,\beta\geq 0$), subjected to multiplicative Gaussian noise in a Poincar\'e domain (which may be bounded or unbounded) $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ ($2\leq d\leq 4$). We show the local monotonicity ($p\geq \frac{d}{2}+1,\ r\geq 2$) as well as global monotonicity ($p\geq 2,\ r\geq 4$) properties of the linear and nonlinear operators, which along with an application of a stochastic version of the Minty-Browder technique imply the existence of a unique pathwise strong solution satisfying the energy equality (It\^o formula), which is proved with the help of the methodology developed in [Krylov, \emph{Probab. Theory Related Fields}, {\bf 147} (2010), 583--605.] Then, we discuss the small time asymptotics by studying the effect of small, highly nonlinear, unbounded drifts (small time large deviation principle) for the stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equations with damping.</description>

      <title>Random field reconstruction of inhomogeneous turbulence. Part I: Modeling and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and analyze a random field model for the reconstruction of inhomogeneous turbulence from characteristic flow quantities provided by $k$-$\varepsilon$ simulations. The model is based on stochastic integrals that combine moving average and Fourier-type representations in time and space, respectively, where both the time integration kernel and the spatial energy spectrum depend on the macroscopically varying characteristic quantities. The structure of the model is derived from spectral representations of homogeneous fields by means of a two-scale approach in combination with specific stochastic integral transformations. Our approach allows for a rigorous analytical verification of the desired statistical properties and is accessible to numerical simulation. The constructed inhomogeneous field is shown to satisfy the characteristic $k$-$\varepsilon$ flow properties and the condition of incompressibility in an asymptotic sense. Moreover, a novel inhomogeneous ergodicity result establishes the approximation of local characteristic values by means of local averages in time and space.</description>

      <title>Convergence of kinetic Langevin samplers for non-convex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three kinetic Langevin samplers including the Euler discretization, the BU and the UBU splitting scheme. We provide contraction results in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for non-convex potentials. These results are based on a carefully tailored distance function and an appropriate coupling construction. Additionally, the error in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance between the true target measure and the invariant measure of the discretization scheme is bounded. To get an $\varepsilon$-accuracy in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, we show complexity guarantees of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ for the Euler scheme and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for the UBU scheme under appropriate assumptions on the target measure. The results are applicable to interacting particle systems and provide bounds for sampling probability measures of mean-field type.</description>

      <title>Mixed Poisson families with real-valued mixing distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed Poisson distributions provide a flexible approach to the analysis of count data with overdispersion, zero inflation, or heavy tails. Since the Poisson mean must be nonnegative, the mixing distribution is typically assumed to have nonnegative support. We show this assumption is unnecessary and real-valued mixing distributions are also possible. Informally, the mixing distribution merely needs to have a light (subexponential) left tail and a small amount of probability mass on negative values. We provide several concrete examples, including the mixed Poisson-extreme stable family, where the mixing distribution has a power law tail.</description>

      <title>GUE Fluctuations Near the Axis in One-Sided Ballistic Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a variation of the classic ballistic deposition model in which vertically falling blocks can only stick to the top or the upper right corner of growing columns. We establish that fluctuations of the height function at points near the $t$-axis are given by the GUE ensemble and its corresponding Tracy-Widom limiting distribution. The proof is based on a graphical construction of the process in terms of a directed Last Passage Percolation model. Using this graphical construction, we define the notion of geodesics for the height function and show that the wandering exponent governing the transversal fluctuations of these geodesics is $2/3$.</description>

      <title>A Durrett-Remenik particle system in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a branching-selection model of motionless particles in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with nonlocal branching, introduced by Durrett and Remenik in dimension $1$. The assumptions on the fitness function, $F$, and on the inhomogeneous branching distribution, are mild. The evolution equation for the macroscopic density is given by an integro-differential free boundary problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$, in which the free boundary represents the least $F$-value in the population. The main result is the characterization of the limit in probability of the empirical measure process in terms of the unique solution to this free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuations of last passage percolation with thick boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the exponential last passage percolation (LPP) with thick two-sided boundary that consists of a few inhomogeneous columns and rows. Ben Arous and Corwin previously studied the limit fluctuations in this model except in a critical regime, for which they predicted that the limit distribution exists and depends only on the most dominant columns and rows. In this article, we prove their conjecture and identify the limit distribution explicitly in terms of a Fredholm determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix kernel. This result leads in particular to an explicit variational formula for the one-point marginal of the KPZ fixed point for a new class of initial conditions. Our limit distribution is also a novel generalization of and provides a new numerically efficient representation for the Baik--Rains distribution.</description>

      <title>Benford behavior resulting from stick and box fragmentation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benford's law is the statement that in many real world data sets, the probability of having digit $d$ in base $B$, where $1 \leq d \leq B$, as the first digit is \log_{B}\!\left(\frac{d+1}{d}\right). We sometimes refer to this as weak Benford behavior, and we say that a data set exhibits strong Benford behavior in base $B$ if the probability of having significand at most s, where $1 \leq s &lt; B$, is \log_{B}\!\left(s\right). We examine Benford behaviors in two different probabilistic models: stick and box fragmentation. Building on the work by arXiv:1309.5603 on the one-dimensional stick fragmentation model, we employ combinatorial identities on multinomial coefficients to reduce the high-dimensional stick fragmentation model to the one-dimensional model and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the lengths of the stick fragments to converge to strong Benford behavior. Then we answer a conjecture by arXiv:2304.08335 on the high-dimensional box fragmentation model. Using tools from order statistics, we prove that under some mild conditions, faces of any arbitrary dimension of the box have total volume converging to strong Benford behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotient function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotient function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type dichotomy for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ Theory from many-body quantum Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas. To be precise, starting from many-body quantum mechanics, where the problem is linear and regular but involving non commutative operators, we justify the emergence of the $\Phi^4_3$ measure as a semiclassical limit which captures the formation of Bose--Einstein condensation just above the critical temperature. We employ and develop several tools from both stochastic quantization and many-body quantum mechanics. Since the quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential, our first key step involves approximating the $\Phi^4_3$ measure through a Hartree measure with nonlocal interaction, achieved by developing new techniques in paracontrolled calculus. The connection between the quantum problem and the Hartree measure emerges through a variational interplay between classical and quantum models.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Multiplier Bootstrap for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing the confidence sets using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Under appropriate regularity conditions, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$. Notably, this rate can be faster than the one that can be proven in the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. To our knowledge, this provides the first fully non-asymptotic bound on the accuracy of bootstrap approximations in SGD algorithms. Our analysis builds on the Gaussian approximation results for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables.</description>

      <title>Langevin Monte-Carlo Provably Learns Depth Two Neural Nets at Any Size and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</description>

      <title>Efficient stochastic simulation of gene regulatory networks using hybrid models of transcriptional bursting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell data reveal the presence of biological stochasticity between cells of identical genome and environment, in particular highlighting the transcriptional bursting phenomenon. To account for this property, gene expression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical species are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for realistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise for capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to specialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more accessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of SSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm for a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and prove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we use the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights the fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained by transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies that may emerge from interactions between genes.</description>
