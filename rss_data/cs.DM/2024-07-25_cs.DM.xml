      <title>Bad local minima exist in the stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the disassortative stochastic block model with three communities, a well-studied model of graph partitioning and Bayesian inference for which detailed predictions based on the cavity method exist [Decelle et al. (2011)]. We provide strong evidence that for a part of the phase where efficient algorithms exist that approximately reconstruct the communities, inference based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fails. In other words, we show that there exist modes of the posterior distribution that have a vanishing agreement with the ground truth. The proof is based on the analysis of a graph colouring algorithm from [Achlioptas and Moore (2003)].</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the average edit distance between two random strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the average edit distance between two random strings. More precisely, we adapt a technique introduced by Lueker in the context of the average longest common subsequence of two random strings to improve the known upper bound on the average edit distance. We improve all the known upper bounds for small alphabets. We also provide a new implementation of Lueker technique to improve the lower bound on the average length of the longest common subsequence of two random strings for all small alphabets of size other than $2$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs dominated by a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. We prove that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, a vertex of $F$ is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \big\lfloor \frac{m+1}{k+2} \big\rfloor$ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. This was recently posed as a conjecture by Zhang and Wu, who settled the case where $F$ is a star. The result for the case where $F$ is a clique had been obtained by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author. The bound is attainable for any $m \geq 0$ unless $m = k \leq 2$. New ideas, such as the consideration of divisibility, are introduced in the proof of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Balanced independent sets and colorings of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ is $k$-partite if $V$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that every edge in $E$ contains precisely one vertex from each $V_i$. We call such a graph $n$-balanced if $|V_i| = n$ for each $i$. An independent set $I$ in $H$ is balanced if $|I\cap V_i| = |I\cap V_j|$ for each $1 \leq i, j \leq k$, and a coloring is balanced if each color class induces a balanced independent set in $H$. In this paper, we provide a lower bound on the balanced independence number $\alpha_b(H)$ in terms of the average degree $D = |E|/n$, and an upper bound on the balanced chromatic number $\chi_b(H)$ in terms of the maximum degree $\Delta$. Our results recover those of recent work of Chakraborti for $k = 2$.</description>
