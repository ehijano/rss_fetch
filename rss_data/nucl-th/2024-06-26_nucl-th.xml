      <title>Hybrid isentropic twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of hybrid neutron stars with color superconducting quark matter cores at finite temperature that results in sequences of stars with constant entropy per baryon, $s/n_B={\rm const}$. For the quark matter equation of state, we employ a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model while nuclear matter is described with a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class. The phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction under isothermal conditions. We find that traversing the mixed phase on a trajectory at low $s/n_B\lesssim 2$ in the phase diagram shows a heating effect while at larger $s/n_B$ the temperature drops. This behavior may be attributed to the presence of a color superconducting quark matter phase at low temperatures and the melting of the diquark condensate which restores the normal quark matter phase at higher temperatures. While the isentropic hybrid star branch at low $s/n_B\lesssim 2$ is connected to the neutron star branch, it gets disconnected at higher entropy per baryon so that the "thermal twin" phenomenon is observed. We find that the transition from connected to disconnected hybrid star sequences may be estimated with the Seidov criterion for the difference in energy densities. The radii and masses at the onset of deconfinement exhibit a linear relationship and thus define a critical compactness of the isentropic star configuration for which the transition occurs which for large enough $s/n_B\gtrsim 2$ is accompanied by an instability. The results of this study may be of relevance for uncovering the conditions for the supernova explodability of massive blue supergiant stars by the quark deconfinement mechanism. The accretion-induced deconfinement transition with thermal twin formation may contribute to explaining the origin of eccentric orbits in some binary systems and the origin of isolated millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Moments of the charge distribution observed through electron scattering in H3 and He3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moments of the charge distributions obtained by the analysis of electron-scattering data are examined in $^3$H and $^3$He. It is shown that the experimental form-factors are well explained, but the values of the moments of the charge distributions are not determined uniquly by the present analyses.</description>

      <title>Transient spin modes from relaxational axial kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spin mode by solving the axial kinetic equations under the relaxation time approximation in the presence of dissipative sources. We find transient spin modes in response to electric field with spacetime inhomogeneity, fluid acceleration and shear. To the lowest order in spatial gradient $k$, we find the responses to electric field and acceleration can be interpreted as retarded response to time variations of magnetic field and vorticity respectively. The response to shear can lead to a global spin polarization suppressed by powers of $k$. Beyond lowest order, the responses to all three sources are non-local with branch cut in the dispersions. We argue that the non-locality is a consequence of the quasi-particle picture underlying the kinetic description. We also analyze the mixing between spin modes and shear modes alone using the response we have obtained, finding the spin modes split into three with two of them developing oscillatory behavior. The correction to damping dispersions occur at $O(k^{4/3})$, which is parametrically larger than the existing one due to mixing of spin modes with shear and vorticity modes. It also indicates possible breakdown of gradient expansion.</description>

      <title>Towards Hypernuclei from Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <title>Study of Heavy Quarkonia in the presence of magnetic field by Nikiforov Uvarov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The N-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation has been solved using the Nikiforov Uvarov (NU) method, in which we used the medium modified form of Cornell potential and quasi-particle Debye mass with strong magnetic field background. The binding energies and the mass spectra of heavy quarkonium have been studied in the N-dimensional space for different values of magnetic field, the binding energy decreases with increasing magnetic field, which shows early dissociation of heavy quarkonium system. The influence of dimensionality number has also been discussed on binding energies of J/{\psi} and {\Upsilon} for fixed value of magnetic field. It is found that with an increase in dimensionality, the binding energy starts decreasing from a higher initial value. The results obtained are quite consistent with recent studies.</description>

      <title>The $\Omega(2012)$ as a hadronic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new excited baryon state, $\Omega(2012)$, was observed in the invariant mass spectra of $K^-\Xi^0$ and $K^0_S \Xi^-$ by the Belle Collaboration. This state has a narrow width ($\sim 6$ MeV) compared to other baryon states with a similar mass. In this paper, we provide a mini-review on the $\Omega(2012)$ state from the molecular perspective, where it appears to be a dynamically generated state with spin-parity $3/2^-$ from the coupled-channels interactions of the $\bar{K} \Xi(1530)$ and $\eta \Omega$ in $s$-wave and $\bar{K} \Xi$ in $d$-wave. Additionally, alternative explanations for the $\Omega(2012)$ resonance are also discussed.</description>

      <title>MC-EKRT: Monte Carlo event generator with saturated minijet production for initializing 3+1 D fluid dynamics in high energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model, MC-EKRT, for computing partonic initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions. Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, includes dynamical minijet-multiplicity fluctuations in the saturation and particle production, introduces a new type of spatially dependent nuclear parton distribution functions, and accounts for the conservation of energy/momentum and valence-quark number. In this proof-of-principle study, we average a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions and compute the rapidity and centrality dependence of the charged hadron multiplicities and elliptic flow for the LHC Pb+Pb and RHIC Au+Au collisions using 3+1 D viscous fluid-dynamical evolution. Also event-by-event fluctuations and decorrelations of initial eccentricities are studied. The good agreement with the rapidity-dependent data suggests that the same saturation mechanism that has been very successful in explaining the mid-rapidity observables, works well also at larger rapidities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of nuclear mass or binding energy, a fundamental property of atomic nuclei, remains at the forefront of nuclear physics research due to limitations in experimental studies and uncertainties in model calculations, particularly when moving away from the stability line. In this work, we employ two machine learning (ML) models, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), to assess their performance in predicting nuclear mass excesses using available experimental data and a physics-based feature space. We also examine the extrapolation capabilities of these models using newly measured nuclei from AME2020 and by extending our calculations beyond the training and test set regions. Our results indicate that both SVR and GPR models perform quite well within the training and test regions when informed with a physics-based feature space. Furthermore, these ML models demonstrate the ability to make reasonable predictions away from the available experimental data, offering results comparable to the model calculations. Through further refinement, these models can be used as reliable and efficient ML tools for studying nuclear properties in the future.</description>

      <title>Hexadecapole deformation of $^{238}$U from relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a nonlinear response coefficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hexadecapole deformation ($\beta_4$) of the $^{238}$U nucleus has not been determined because its effect is overwhelmed by those from the nucleus' large quadrupole deformation ($\beta_2$) in nuclear electric transition measurements. In this Letter, we identify the nonlinear response of the hexadecapole anisotropy to ellipticity in relativistic $^{238}$U+ $^{238}$U collisions that is solely sensitive to $\beta_4$ and insensitive to $\beta_2$. We demonstrate this by state-of-the-art hydrodynamic calculations and discuss the prospects of discovering the $\beta_4$ of $^{238}$U in heavy-ion data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Framework for Multi-messenger Inference from Neutron Stars: Combining Nuclear Theory Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an efficient parameterization of the pure neutron-matter equation of state (EoS) that incorporates the uncertainties from both chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and phenomenological potential calculations. This parameterization yields a family of EoSs including and extending the forms based purely on these two calculations. In combination with an agnostic inner core EoS, this parameterization is used in a Bayesian inference pipeline to obtain constraints on the e os parameters using multi-messenger observations of neutron stars. We specifically considered observations of the massive pulsar J0740+6620, the binary neutron star coalescence GW170817, and the NICER pulsar J0030+0451. Constraints on neutron star mass-radius relations are obtained and compared. The Bayes factors for the different EoS models are also computed. While current constraints do not reveal any significant preference among these models, the framework developed here may enable future observations with more sensitive detectors to discriminate them.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectrum of Non-Charmed and Charmed Meson States in Extended Linear-Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass spectrum of different meson particles is generated using an effective Lagrangian of the extended linear-sigma model (eLSM) for scalar and pseudoscalar meson fields and quark flavors, up, down, strange, and charm. Analytical formulas for the masses of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axialvector meson states are derived assuming global chiral symmetry. The various eLSM parameters are analytically deduced and numerically computed. This enables accurate estimations of the masses of sixteen non-charmed and thirteen charmed meson states at vanishing temperature. The comparison of these results to recent compilation of the particle data group (PDG) allows to draw the conclusion that the masses of sixteen non-charmed and thirteen charmed meson states calculated in the eLSM are in good agreement with the PDG. This shows that the eLSM, with its configurations and parameters, is an effective theoretical framework for determining the mass spectra of various non-charmed and charmed meson states, particularly at vanishing temperature.</description>

      <title>Partial-transpose-guided entanglement classes and minimum noise filtering in many-body Gaussian quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reduction and distortion of quantum correlations in the presence of classical noise leads to varied levels of inefficiency in the availability of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols. While generically minimizing required entanglement for mixed quantum states remains challenging, a class of many-body Gaussian quantum states ($\mathcal{N}$IC) is here identified that exhibits two-mode bipartite entanglement structure, resembling that of pure states, for which the logarithmic negativity entanglement measure remains invariant upon inclusion of the classical correlations and optimal entanglement resources can be clearly quantified. This subclass is found to be embedded within a broader class of many-body Gaussian states ($\mathcal{N}$-SOL) that retain two-mode entanglement structure for detection processes. These two entanglement classes are relevant in theoretical and experimental applications from the scalar field vacuum to the local axial motional modes of trapped ion chains. Utilizing the subspace that heralds inseparability in response to partial transposition, a minimum noise filtering process is designed to be necessary, sufficient, and computable for determining membership in these classes of entanglement structure. Application of this process to spacelike regions of the free scalar field vacuum is found to improve resource upper bounds, providing new understanding of the entanglement required for the quantum simulation of quantum fields as observed by arrays of local detectors.</description>

      <title>Alpha radioactivity deep-underground as a probe of axion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the time modulation of radioisotope decays deep underground as a method to explore axion dark matter. In this work, we focus on the $\alpha$-decay of heavy isotopes and develop a theoretical description for the $\theta$-dependence of $\alpha$-decay half-lives, which enables us to predict the time variation of $\alpha$-radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. To probe this scenario, we have recently constructed and installed a setup deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the $\alpha$-decay of Americium-241. This prototype experiment, named RadioAxion-$\alpha$, will allow us to explore a broad range of oscillation's periods, from a micro-second up to one year, thus providing competitive limits on the axion decay constant across 13 orders of magnitude in the axion mass, ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-20}$ eV after one month of data collection, and down to $10^{-22}$ eV after three years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent finding that semi-inclusive detections of heavy hadrons exhibit fair stabilization patterns in high-energy resummed distributions against (missing) higher-order corrections, we review and extend our studies on the hadroproduction of light and heavy hadrons tagged in forward and far-forward rapidity ranges. We analyze the NLL/NLO+ behavior of rapidity rates and angular multiplicities via the JETHAD method, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is consistently embodied in the collinear picture. We explore kinematic regions that are within LHC typical acceptances, as well as novel sectors accessible thanks the combined tagging of a far-forward light or heavy hadron at future Forward Physics Facilities and a of central particle at LHC experiments via a precise timing-coincidence setup.</description>
