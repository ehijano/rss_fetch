      <title>Geometric invariance from outer surfaces: Laplace-governed magnetization in the high-permeability limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetization of bodies in static fields, formulated as transmission problems of the Laplace equation, has been a standard topic in electrodynamics for over a century. In the infinite permeability limit, the body becomes approximately equipotential. However, surprisingly, this textbook-level description captures only the internal potential, leaving the exterior field largely unaddressed. Textbooks typically note only that the external magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$ is normal to the surface near the boundary, without further characterizing the exterior field. This raises a question: could the exterior field exhibit additional fundamental properties? Here, we fill this gap and reveal a previously overlooked geometric invariance: in the same limit, the entire external magnetic response, including field distribution and all multipole moments, is determined solely by the outer surface geometry, independent of its internal structure or deformation. This invariance provides a theoretical basis for the lightweight design of magnetic devices such as flux concentrators. Given that analogous Laplace transmission problems arise across physics, including electric conduction, heat flow, and acoustic scattering, this invariance exhibits cross-disciplinary universality. Together with quasi-equipotential property, it completes the characterization of Laplace transmission problems in the infinite permeability limit.</description>

      <title>A minimal model with stochastically broken reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.</description>
