      <title>Role of thermal fluctuations in nucleation of three-flavor quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework that aims to investigate the role of thermal fluctuations of the matter composition and color-superconductivity in the nucleation of three-flavor deconfined quark matter in the typical conditions of high-energy astrophysical systems related to compact stars. It is usually assumed that the flavor composition is locally fixed during the formation of the first seed of deconfined quark matter since weak interaction acts too slowly to re-equilibrate flavors. However, the matter composition fluctuates around its average equilibrium values at the typical temperatures of high-energy astrophysical processes. Here, we extend our previous two-flavor nucleation formalism to a three-flavor case. We develop a thermodynamic framework incorporating finite-size effects and thermal fluctuations of local composition to compute the nucleation probability as the product of droplet formation and composition fluctuation rates. Moreover, we discuss the role of color-superconductivity in nucleation, arguing that it can play a role only in systems larger than the typical coherence length of diquark pairs. We found that thermal fluctuations of the matter composition lead to lowering the potential barrier between the metastable hadronic phase and the stable quark phase. Moreover, the formation of diquark pairs reduces the critical radius and thus the potential barrier in the low baryon density and temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Identifying hyperons in neutron star matter from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slope of the neutron star mass radius curve $dM/dR$ determined from two large sets of relativistic mean field equations of state for nucleonic and hyperonic neutron star matter is discussed. It is shown that if the mass-radius curve always has a negative slope the probability that the star has hyperons is very small. A very small probability of the presence of hyperons can already be identified by a negative slope for low-mass stars. A positive slope at $M/M_{\odot} = 1.4$, could indicate the possible presence of hyperons. Nucleonic EoS are found to be more probable than hyperonic ones, given the GW170817 and NICER observation constraints for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the highest probability is associated with nucleonic stars that originate a mass radius curve with positive slope. Mass-radius curves with a positive slope greater than 1.8$M_\odot$ are not expected to occur. The nuclear matter property that most distinguishes the different scenarios is the curvature of the symmetry energy, with nucleonic EoS with positive slope predicting the highest values that can go above 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Perspectives for hyperon and hypernuclei physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypernuclei, nuclei containing one or more hyperons, serve as unique laboratories for probing the non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Recent progress in hypernuclear physics, driven by advanced experimental techniques and theoretical innovations, is briefly reviewed with a focus on key findings and unresolved challenges, such as the precise determination of the hypertriton binding energy, investigations of charge symmetry breaking in mirror hypernuclei, and the search for exotic systems, including the neutral nn$\Lambda$ state. Experimental breakthroughs, including invariant-mass analyses and femtoscopy studies in heavy-ion collisions, as well as high-resolution $\gamma$-spectroscopy, have enabled precise studies of light hypernuclei and offered critical insights into the hyperon-nucleon interaction. Theoretical progress, including ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field theory and lattice QCD, has further enhanced our understanding of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions.</description>

      <title>Transport Theory and Correlation Measurements: Coming to Terms on Emission Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-particle correlations play a pivotal role in understanding the space-time characteristics of particle emission in Heavy-ion collisions. These characteristics are typically represented by a relative emission source and can be obtained using transport model simulations such as the Boltzmann- Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport model. In this paper, we utilize the BUU transport model to simulate the p-p source. Subsequently, we integrate this source and the p-p kernel within the KP formula to calculate the correlations. By comparing the correlations obtained from the BUU simulation with those obtained using imaging methods, such as the deblurring method, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of fast and slow emissions on the measured correlations. Specifically, this comparison is used as a tool to determine a function (tail) that represents the relative distribution of the particle pair from secondary decay emissions. Thus, we correct the BUU source function by incorporating a tail to account for the contribution of secondary decay emissions, which cannot be accurately captured by BUU simulations. Resulting source function reproduces the features in the measured correlations. To illustrate our approach, we examine p-p correlations measured in Ar + Sc reactions at E/A = 80 MeV, considering both momentum-independent and momentum-dependent nuclear equations of state (EOS).</description>

      <title>Contact potentials in presence of a regular finite-range interaction using dimensional regularization and the $N/D$ method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation (LSE) with a kernel that includes a regular finite-range potential and additional contact terms with derivatives. We employ distorted wave theory and dimensional regularization, as proposed in Physics Letters B 568 (2003) 109. We analyze the spin singlet nucleon-nucleon $S-$wave as case of study, with the regular one-pion exchange (OPE) potential in this partial wave and up to ${\cal O}(Q^6)$ (six derivatives) contact interactions. We discuss in detail the renormalization of the LSE, and show that the scattering amplitude solution of the LSE fulfills exact elastic unitarity and inherits the left-hand cut of the long-distance OPE amplitude. Furthermore, we proof that the LSE amplitude coincides with that obtained from the exact $N/D$ calculation, with the appropriate number and typology of subtractions to reproduce the effective range parameters taken as input to renormalize the LSE amplitude. The generalization to higher number of derivatives is straightforward.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically the bosons $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$ as well as the fermions $p(\bar p)$, produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including tandard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit orderly a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

      <title>Initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the initial condition of the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy using HERA deep inelastic scattering data. Posterior distributions characterizing the initial condition are extracted using Bayesian inference. The total cross section and charm quark production data from HERA are found to provide stringent constraints on the posterior. These distributions quantify the uncertainty in the initial condition and serve as necessary input for propagating uncertainties to all NLO calculations within the Color Glass Condensate framework.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedup in quantum simulation of Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian via orbifold lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian -- an approach known for its efficiency in simulating SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and QCD on digital quantum computers -- can reproduce the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian in a controlled limit. While the original Kogut-Susskind approach faces significant implementation challenges on quantum hardware, we show that it emerges naturally as the infinite scalar mass limit of the orbifold lattice formulation, even at finite lattice spacing. Our analysis provides both a general analytical framework applicable to SU($N$) gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions and specific numerical evidence for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) Yang-Mills theories ($N=2,3$). Using Euclidean path integral methods, we quantify the convergence rate by comparing the standard Wilson action with the orbifold lattice action, matching lattice parameters, and systematically extrapolating results as the bare scalar mass approaches infinity. This reformulation resolves longstanding technical obstacles and offers a straightforward implementation protocol for digital quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with exponential speedup compared to classical methods and previously known quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Unwinding the rare $\Omega$ sector: Fragmentation of fully charmed baryons from HL-LHC to FCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By adopting a hadron-structure-oriented approach, we present and discuss the release of the novel OMG3Q1.0 set of collinear fragmentation functions for fully charmed, rare $\Omega$ baryons. Our methodology combines diquark-like proxy model inputs for both charm-quark and gluon channels, calculated at the initial energy scales, with a DGLAP evolution that ensures a consistent treatment of heavy-quark thresholds, following directly from the HF-NRevo scheme. We complement our work with a phenomenological study of NLL/NLO$^+$ resummed $\Omega_{3c}$ plus jet distributions using (sym)JETHAD at the HL-LHC and the future FCC. Unraveling the production mechanisms of rare, yet-unobserved hadrons, as provided by the OMG3Q1.0 functions, stands as a key asset for deepening our understanding of QCD at future high-energy hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced production of the exotic charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ off nuclear targets and its internal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility to study the famous charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ production off nuclear targets and its properties in inclusive photon-induced reactions near the kinematic threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for its charged components $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon-nucleon interactions as well as three different popular scenarios for their internal structures: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-charm mesons and mixtures of both of them. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at initial photon energies of 9.0-17.5 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and their ratios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$-10$^{\circ}$ and at photon energy of 14 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the ratios of the total cross sections for $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production at photon energy of 14 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures which are by far the best known. Hence, they might be useful for the determination of these structures -- the issue which has attracted much attention in the hadron physics community -- from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the CEBAF facility.</description>

      <title>Thermal dilepton production within conformal viscous Gubser flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing the Gubser solutions of causal relativistic second-order Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics, we study the thermal dilepton production from heavy-ion collisions, considering the transverse expansion of the viscous hot QCD medium along with longitudinal boost-invariance. We analyze the evolution of the temperature and shear stress profiles of the QCD matter under Gubser flow for different values of the associated parameter $q$ (inverse length scale). We study the dilepton production using leading order Born rates from QGP and hadronic sectors under Gubser geometry. Viscous modified dilepton rate is calculated using the first-order Chapman-Enskog (CE) like non-equilibrium correction of the particle distribution function. Our study indicates that lower values of $q$ result in the enhancement of the emitted dilepton spectra. We also determine the effective temperature of the hot QCD medium from the inverse slope of transverse mass spectra, for different $q$. We find that the effective temperature determined from the dilepton spectra for a smaller system to be higher. Further, we compare the strength of CE like and Grad's viscous correction to the ideal dilepton spectra and find that CE type viscous corrections are well behaved compared to that of Grad's in the presence of transverse flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application range of perfect spin hydrodynamics is studied in two cases: one based on the classical spin description and the other using a quantum spin density matrix (Wigner function). Different forms of the conditions connecting the components of the spin polarization tensor, particle mass, temperature, and hydrodynamic flow are introduced, and their mutual relations are explained. The results obtained are important for practical applications of spin hydrodynamics to model heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy effects on heavy quark dynamics in Gribov modified gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the momentum distribution of the quark-gluon plasma is anisotropic, leading to instabilities in the system due to chromomagnetic plasma modes. In this work, we consider the anisotropic momentum distribution of the medium constituents to investigate its effects on heavy quark dynamics using the nonperturbative Gribov resummation approach within the framework of the Fokker-Planck equation. Specifically, we study the influence of nonperturbative effects and weak anisotropies on the heavy quark transport coefficients, taking into account the angular dependence between the anisotropy vector and the direction of heavy quark motion. Furthermore, the calculated drag and diffusion coefficients are employed to estimate the energy loss of heavy quarks and the nuclear modification factor, incorporating both elastic collisions and inelastic processes. Our findings indicate that momentum anisotropy, angular dependence, and nonperturbative effects-captured through the scattering amplitudes-play a significant role in determining the transport properties of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Review of magnetic- and antimagnetic-rotational structures in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is an update of the 2000 publication of magnetic-rotational bands by Amita et al. [1], followed by an unpublished update of 2006 [2], and reviews detailed experimental data extracted from original publications for 228 magnetic-rotational (MR or Shears) structures spread over 117 nuclides, and 40 antimagnetic-rotational (AMR) structures in 28 nuclei, with a brief commentary about each band. Many of these nuclei are located at or near the semi-magic nucleon numbers, mostly for protons. For example, 88 MR bands are currently known for the Pb (Z=82) nuclei, and 29 AMR band in Pd, Cd and In nuclei. It is interesting that the proton magic numbers appear to play a major role in the MR phenomenon, which seems less well understood. A brief discussion of the salient features of the MR and AMR bands and their theoretical interpretation has been presented in the present review. The tables contain gamma-ray energies, associated level energies with spins and parities, level lifetimes, B(M1), B(E2), and B(M1)/B(E2) ratios and probable spherical quasiparticle configurations. We find that many bands claimed in the literature as MR and AMR bands still have tentative assignments, as level lifetimes, thus B(M1) and B(E2) values, for a large number of MR and AMR bands, which can potentially provide critical criteria for firm identification of such structures, are lacking. Additionally, theoretical model calculations for many of these bands, which could provide insight for a better description of nuclear structure, are also lacking in literature. While this review is mainly based on original research articles, nuclear structure databases ENSDF [3], XUNDL [4], and NSR [5] have been consulted for completeness. The literature cut-off date March 31, 2025.</description>

      <title>Flow harmonic correlations via multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\) = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We demonstrate that while some of these observables are more sensitive to transport properties than traditional flow observables, others are less sensitive, making them suitable for studying different stages of the evolution.</description>

Abstract: The root-mean-square proton and neutron radii for $^{7,9-12,14}$\rm Be, $^{10-15,17}$\rm B, $^{12-19}$\rm C, $^{14,15,17-22}$\rm N, $^{16,18-24}$\rm O, and $^{18-21,23-26}$\rm F isotopes are deduced from a systematic analysis of experimental charge-changing and interaction cross sections in the framework of Glauber model. The calculations involve descriptions of nuclei based on Slater determinants using harmonic oscillator single-particle wave functions. The extracted proton and neutron radii have been examined in the light of some important features such as neutron skin thickness/halo-like structure/subshell closure observed in exotic isotopes.</description>

      <title>Three-body model of $^{6}$He with non-local halo effective field theory potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $^6$He Borromean nucleus in coordinate representation within a three-body model with two-body potentials derived from cluster effective field theory (EFT). These potentials are originally developed in momentum space and Fourier transformed to provide non-local potentials in configuration space. We use hyperspherical coordinates in combination with the Lagrange-mesh technique to compute the ground state energy, root mean square radius and the E1 strength distribution of $^6$He. We also introduce a three-body interaction to eliminate dependencies on the cutoff parameter of the two-body potentials on the ground state energy. The E1 strength distribution exhibits a low lying resonance as expected. However it is strongly influenced by the choice of the three-body EFT interaction.</description>

      <title>Radiative Capture Reaction $d(\alpha,\gamma)^{6}\mathrm{Li} $ in Cluster Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the radiative capture process of the deuteron on alpha particle leading to the formation of $^6{\textrm{Li}}$ in the two-body formalism through the cluster effective field theory~(CEFT). It was the primitive nuclear reaction to produce ${^6 \textrm{Li}}$ in a few minutes after the Big Bang. In detail, we outline the calculation of the dominant $E1$ and $E2$ electromagnetic transition amplitudes of $d(\alpha,\gamma ){^6\textrm{Li}}$. Then, we obtain the astrophysical S-factor by fitting it to the experimental data. Finally, we compare the obtained CEFT results for the astrophysical S-factor with the other theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-particle condensation in diluted $^{16}\text{O}$ at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of temperature on $\alpha$-particle clustering in the diluted nucleus $^{16}\text{O}$ using the multi-constrained finite-temperature relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model with the DD-ME2 interaction. At a critical density the nucleus undergoes a Mott-like transition from a homogeneous to a localised configuration characterised by $\alpha$-particle clustering and the emergence of a finite non-axial octupole deformation. We study the interplay between the onset of localisation under nuclear dilution and the suppression of deformation and $\alpha$-particle clustering due to increasing temperature. Investigating the temperature-density plane, our findings indicate that temperature delays the formation of non-axial octupole deformation and $\alpha$-particle clustering in dilute environments. Following the transition from homogeneous to clustered configurations, the non-axial octupole deformation continues to increase with further dilution of the system and becomes nearly independent of temperature. We found that $\alpha$-particle clusters appear at temperatures up to $T = 4.10$ MeV and at a corresponding normalised density $\rho_{\text{Mott}}/\rho_0 \approx 0.09$.</description>

      <title>The role of the screening potential in the deuteron-deuteron thermonuclear reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deuteron-deuteron (D-D) thermonuclear reaction rates in metallic environments (considering the electron screening effects)
  is calculated using the S-factor functions which
  were obtained by fitting to low-energy data on D-D reactions.
  For this purpose, a fitted S-factor model based on the NACRE compilation is employed.
  This limited the energy range of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) for
  the $ ^{2}\textrm{H}\left(d,p\right) ^{3}\textrm{H}$ and $^{2} \textrm{H} \left(d,n\right) ^{3}\textrm{He}$ reactions.
  The corresponding Maxwellian-averaged thermonuclear reaction
  rates of relevance in astrophysical plasmas at temperatures in the
  range from $10^{6}$ K to $10^{10}\left(\textrm{or }1.3\times10^{8}\right)$ K are provided in tabular formats.
  In these evaluations,
  the screening energy ($ U_{e} $) is assumed to be $100, 400, 750, 1000$ eV and $1250$ eV.
  This series of values has been selected based on theoretical and experimental studies conducted so far.
  %
  Eventually, our numerical analysis suggests that the ratio of the reaction rate with the screening potential to the reaction rate without the screening potential, can be described by the term $ \exp\left(4.70 +6.50\:{U_{e}}/{T_{9}}\right) $ for both $ ^{2}\textrm{H}\left(d,p\right) ^{3}\textrm{H}$ and $^{2} \textrm{H} \left(d,n\right) ^{3}\textrm{He}$ reactions.

      <title>Simultaneous description of high density QCD matter in heavy ion collisions and neutron star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A combined constraint on the QCD equation of state, at high densities, from connecting neutron star observations to data from heavy ion reactions is presented. We use the Chiral Mean Field Model which can describe neutron star and iso-spin symmetric matter and allows the consistent calculation of the density and momentum dependent potentials of baryons which are then implemented in the UrQMD transport model. In contrast to previous studies, the same equation of state constrained from neutron star properties is also able to describe experimental observables in heavy ion reactions at the HADES experiment. Unlike many other approaches our results are not constraint to densities up to nuclear saturation or perturbative results which allows a continuous description of the equation of state over a large range in baryon density.</description>

      <title>The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.</description>
