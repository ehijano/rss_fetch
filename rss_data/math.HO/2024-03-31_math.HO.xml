      <title>The Camel-Banana Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A camel can carry one banana at a time on its back. It is on a diet and therefore can only have one banana at a time in its stomach. As soon as it has eaten a banana it walks a mile and then it needs a new banana (in order to be able to continue its itinerary). Let there be a stock of N bananas at the border of the desert. How far can the camel penetrate into the desert, starting at this point? (Of course it can form new stocks with transported bananas.)</description>

      <title>The altitudes of a triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing, unanswered question regarding Euclid's Elements concerns the absence of a theorem for the concurrence of the altitudes of a triangle, and the possible reasons for this omission. In the centuries following Euclid, a remarkable number of proofs have been put forward; this suggests a search for the most elementary and direct proof. This paper provides a simple, direct, elementary proof of the theorem; it is based solely on the Elements.</description>

      <title>A review of Alfred North Whitehead's "Introduction to Mathematics"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1911, Alfred North Whitehead published a short book "Introduction to Mathematics" (IM) intended for students wanting an explanation of the fundamental ideas of mathematics. Whitehead's IM has enduring value because it was written not long after he and Bertrand Russell published their monumental three-volume work "Principia Mathematica" (PM) -- a publication of immense historical significance for mathematics. IM sheds light on Whitehead's view of mathematics at that time. Whitehead's book places proofs in predicate logic as the mythical starting point of mathematics, although Whitehead himself was slow to understand the significance of symbolic predicate logic.</description>

      <title>A survey of lattice properties: modular, Arguesian, linear, and distributive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey of characterizations and relationships between some properties of lattices, particularly the modular, Arguesian, linear, and distributive properties, but also some other related properties. The survey emphasizes finite and finitary lattices and deemphasizes complemented lattices.</description>

      <title>Main topics of the NumHyp-2015' discussion session</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three main topics were raised in this discussion session, which took place on the 19th of June at the NumHyp-2015 meeting: nonlinear resonance for 1D systems of balance laws, dispersive extensions of standard hyperbolic conservation laws, and the validation of weakly dispersive shallow water wave models. An introductory overview with many bibliographic references is provided for all these topics. Based on kinetic formulation, a numerical strategy that can overcome resonance issues is presented, and a well-balanced (WB) technique for Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations is outlined. This WB scheme relies on the spectral representation of stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Riemann Integration in the Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called Riemann sums have their origin in the efforts of Greek mathematicians to find the center of gravity or the volume of a solid body. These researches led to the method of exhaustion, discovered by Archimedes and described using modern ideas by MacLaurin in his \textit{Treatise of Fluxions} in 1742. At this times the sums were only a practical method for computing an area under a curve, and the existence of this area was considered geometrically obvious. The method of exhaustion consists in almost covering the space enclosed by the curve with $n$ geometric objects with well-known areas such as rectangles or triangles, and finding the limit (though this topic was very blurry at these early times) when $n$ increases. One of its most remarkable application is squaring the area $\mathcal{A}$ enclosed by a parabola and a line.</description>

      <title>The Peculiar Destiny of Sentiment de Monsieur Leibnitz (May 1705 -- March 1706)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the querelle des infiniment petits, Leibniz wrote several texts to justify using Differential calculus among Parisian savants. However, only three were published. Among these publications, ''Sentiment de Monsieur Leibnitz'' had a peculiar destiny. Although we are aware of the manuscript (Gotha FB A 448--449, Bl. 41--42), it is only recently that we have identified a copy of its impression in the British Library catalogue. This copy was printed in 1706 together with writings by other mathematicians united in the defence of the new calculus -- Joseph Saurin, Jacob Hermann and the Bernoulli brothers. Recently published epistolary exchanges indicate that Jean-Paul Bignon, at the time director of the Royal Academy of Sciences, in order to calm down the institution, had prohibited this publication and confiscated the prints.This article examine the epistemological and institutional issues at stake in ''Sentiment de Monsieur Leibnitz''.</description>

      <title>A well-motivated proof that pi is irrational</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ivan Niven's succinct proof that pi is irrational is easy to verify, but it begins with a magical formula that appears to come out of nowhere, and whose origin remains mysterious even after one goes through the proof. The goal of this expository paper is to describe a thought process by which a mathematician might come up with the proof from scratch, without having to be a genius. Compared to previous expositions of Niven's proof, perhaps the main novelty in the present account is an explicit appeal to the theory of orthogonal polynomials, which leads naturally to the consideration of certain integrals whose relevance is otherwise not immediately obvious.</description>

      <title>In Theodorus' Spiral no two hypothenusa lie on the same line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the rectangular triangle with sides with length 1 and 1, then the oblique side has length square root of 2. Now construct on top of the oblique side, a new rectangular triangle with the oblique side as rectangle side and a second rectangle side of length 1. Continue this process indefinitely, what you get is called "the spiral of Theodorus". Now the question is: Can there be two hypothenusa (oblique sides) which lie on the same line? Apparently there can't. A proof of this proposition was given in 1958, but to our knowledge no other proofs are available. Since we had no access to the journal, we wanted to prove it again.</description>
