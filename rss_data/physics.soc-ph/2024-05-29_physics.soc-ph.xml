      <title>On the Analogy of Gauge Theory of Plasticity and Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated the analogy between Economics and Gauge Theory of Plasticity and used it to describe the relationship between money supply and inflation at the economic market. The received equations of economical dynamics in phase space are similar to the plasticity equations and economic variables - choice, competition and profit correspond to the state of the market with inflation. We described the meaning of equations and the role of its variables in the stabilization mechanism of the market with inflation. The equation of market equilibrium including the Profit turnover, time changes of competition, capital and choice was discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Universal deterministic patterns in stochastic count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of deterministic patterns in plots showing the relationship between the mean and the Fano factor (ratio of variance and mean) of stochastic count data. These patterns are found in a wide variety of datasets, including those from genomics, paper citations, commerce, ecology, disease outbreaks, and employment statistics. We develop a theory showing that the patterns naturally emerge when data sampled from discrete probability distributions is organised in matrix form. The theory precisely predicts the patterns and shows that they are a function of only one variable - the sample size.</description>

      <title>State Feedback as a Strategy for Control and Analysis of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on a compartmental epidemic model for COVID-19, examining the stability of its equilibrium points upon the introduction of vaccination as a strategy to mitigate the spread of the disease. Initially, the SIQR (Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantine-Recovered) mathematical model and its technical aspects are introduced. Subsequently, vaccination is incorporated as a control measure within the model scope. Equilibrium points and the basic reproductive number are determined, followed by an analysis of their stability. Furthermore, controllability characteristics and Optimal Control strategies for the system are investigated, supplemented by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergent Inequalities in a Primitive Agent-Based Good-Exchange Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rising inequalities around the globe bring into question our economic systems and the origin of such inequalities. Here we propose a toy agent-based model where each entity is simultaneously producing and consuming indivisible goods. We find that the system exhibits a non-trivial phase transition beyond which a market clearing equilibrium exists but becomes dynamically unreachable. When production capacity exceeds a threshold and adapts too slowly, some agents cannot sell all their goods. This leads to global price deflation and induces strong wealth inequalities, with the spontaneous separation of the population into a rich class and a poor class. We explore ways to alleviate poverty in this model and whether they have real life significance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two mechanisms that have been used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior are altruistic punishment, in which cooperative individuals pay additional costs to punish defection, and multilevel selection, in which competition between groups can help to counteract individual-level incentives to cheat. Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment. Going forward, our PDE framework can serve as a way to connect and compare disparate approaches for understanding multilevel selection across the literature in evolutionary biology and anthropology.</description>

      <title>Modeling of obstacle avoidance by a dense crowd as a Mean-Field Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use a minimal model based on Mean-Field Games (a mathematical framework apt to describe situations where a large number of agents compete strategically) to simulate the scenario where a static dense human crowd is crossed by a cylindrical intruder. After a brief explanation of the mathematics behind it, we compare our model directly against the empirical data collected during a controlled experiment replicating the aforementioned situation. We then summarize the features that make the model adhere so well to the experiment and clarify the anticipation time in this framework.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Games Modeling of Anticipation in Dense Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling pedestrian dynamics in dense crowds is a complex yet essential aspect of crowd management and urban planning. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a dense crowd crossed by a cylindrical intruder using a Mean-Field Game (MFG) model. By incorporating a discount factor to account for pedestrians' limited anticipation and information processing, we examine the model's ability to simulate two distinct experimental configurations: pedestrians facing the obstacle and pedestrians giving their back to the intruder. Through a comprehensive comparison with experimental data, we demonstrate that the MFG model effectively captures essential crowd behaviors, including anticipatory motion and collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear spectral core-periphery detection method for multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-periphery detection aims to separate the nodes of a complex network into two subsets: a core that is densely connected to the entire network and a periphery that is densely connected to the core but sparsely connected internally. The definition of core-periphery structure in multiplex networks that record different types of interactions between the same set of nodes on different layers is nontrivial since a node may belong to the core in some layers and to the periphery in others. We propose a nonlinear spectral method for multiplex networks that simultaneously optimises a node and a layer coreness vector by maximising a suitable nonconvex homogeneous objective function by a provably convergent alternating fixed point iteration. We derive a quantitative measure for the quality of a given multiplex core-periphery structure that allows the determination of the optimal core size. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks illustrate that our approach is robust against noisy layers and significantly outperforms baseline methods while improving the latter with our novel optimised layer coreness weights. As the runtime of our method depends linearly on the number of edges of the network it is scalable to large-scale multiplex networks.</description>
