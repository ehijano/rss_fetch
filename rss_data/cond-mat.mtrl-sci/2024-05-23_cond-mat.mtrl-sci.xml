      <title>High-fidelity level-set modeling of diffusive solid-state phase transformations for polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of microstructures in metallic alloys during hot metal forming involves simultaneous metallurgical complex phenomena. Traditional high-fidelity numerical frameworks used on the polycrystalline scale tend to focus on single-phase microstructures or isolate phase transformations from grain boundary migration mechanisms. The level-set method is highlighted as effective in proposing a global framework for modeling multiphase polycrystalline materials and diffusive solid-state phase transformations. This framework includes novel techniques for efficient large-scale microstructural representation, strong coupling with ThermoCalc software for real-time thermodynamic data, application for ternary alloys and beyond by taking solute drag aspects, and the use of advanced nucleation models. Numerous applications are then illustrated.</description>

      <title>Illustrating an Effective Workflow for Accelerated Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic materials discovery is a multi-disciplinary domain that integrates insights from specialists in alloy design, synthesis, characterization, experimental methodologies, computational modeling, and optimization. Central to this effort is a robust data management system paired with an interactive work platform. This platform should empower users to not only access others data but also integrate their analyses, paving the way for sophisticated data pipelines. To realize this vision, there is a need for an integrative collaboration platform, streamlined data sharing and analysis tools, and efficient communication channels. Such a collaborative mechanism should transcend geographical barriers, facilitating remote interaction and fostering a challenge-response dynamic. In this paper, we present our ongoing efforts in addressing the critical challenges related to an accelerated Materials Discovery Framework as a part of the High-Throughput Materials Discovery for Extreme Conditions Initiative. Our BIRDSHOT Center has successfully harnessed various tools and strategies, including the utilization of cloud-based storage, a standardized sample naming convention, a structured file system, the implementation of sample travelers, a robust sample tracking method, and the incorporation of knowledge graphs for efficient data management. Additionally, we present the development of a data collection platform, reinforcing seamless collaboration among our team members. In summary, this paper provides an illustration and insight into the various elements of an efficient and effective workflow within an accelerated materials discovery framework while highlighting the dynamic and adaptable nature of the data management tools and sharing platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards establishing best practice in the analysis of hydrogen and deuterium by atom probe tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As hydrogen is touted as a key player in the decarbonization of modern society, it is critical to enable quantitative H analysis at high spatial resolution, if possible at the atomic scale. Indeed, H has a known deleterious impact on the mechanical properties (strength, ductility, toughness) of most materials that can hinder their use as part of the infrastructure of a hydrogen-based economy. Enabling H mapping, including local hydrogen concentration analyses at specific microstructural features, is essential for understanding the multiple ways that H affect the properties of materials, including for instance embrittlement mechanisms and their synergies, but also spatial mapping and quantification of hydrogen isotopes is essential to accurately predict tritium inventory of future fusion power plants, ensuring their safe and efficient operation for example. Atom probe tomography (APT) has the intrinsic capabilities for detecting hydrogen (H), and deuterium (D), and in principle the capacity for performing quantitative mapping of H within a material's microstructure. Yet the accuracy and precision of H analysis by APT remain affected by the influence of residual hydrogen from the ultra-high vacuum chamber that can obscure the signal of H from within the material, along with a complex field evaporation behavior. The present article reports the essence of discussions at a focused workshop held at the Max-Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials in April 2024. The workshop was organized to pave the way to establishing best practices in reporting APT data for the analysis of H. We first summarize the key aspects of the intricacies of H analysis by APT and propose a path for better reporting of the relevant data to support interpretation of APT-based H analysis in materials.</description>

      <title>Temperature-invariant heat conductivity from compensating crystalline and glassy transport: from the Steinbach meteorite to furnace bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivities of crystals and glasses vary strongly and with opposite trends upon heating, decreasing in crystals and increasing in glasses. Here, we show--both with first-principles predictions based on the Wigner transport equation and with thermoreflectance experiments--that the dominant transport mechanisms of crystals (particle-like propagation) and glasses (wave-like tunnelling) can coexist and compensate in materials with crystalline bond order and nearly glassy bond geometry. We demonstrate that ideal compensation emerges in a sample of silica in the form of tridymite, carved from a meteorite found in Steinbach (Germany) in 1724, and yields a "propagation-tunneling-invariant" (PTI) conductivity that is independent from temperature and intermediate between the opposite trends of $\alpha$-quartz crystal and silica glass. We show how such PTI conductivity occurs in the quantum regime below the Debye temperature, and can largely persist at high temperatures in a geometrically amorphous tridymite phase found in refractory bricks fired for years in furnaces for steel smelting. Last, we discuss implications to heat transfer in solids exposed to extreme temperature variations, ranging from planetary cooling to heating protocols to reduce the carbon footprint of industrial furnaces.</description>

      <title>Topological polarons in halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites emerged as a revolutionary family of high-quality semiconductors for solar energy harvesting and energy-efficient lighting. There is mounting evidence that the exceptional optoelectronic properties of these materials could stem from unconventional electron-phonon couplings, and it has been suggested that the formation of polarons and self-trapped excitons could be key to understanding such properties. By performing first-principles simulations with unprecedented detail across the length scales, here we show that halide perovskites harbor a uniquely rich variety of polaronic species, including small polarons, large polarons, and charge density waves, and we explain a variety of experimental observations. We find that these emergent quasiparticles support topologically nontrivial phonon fields with quantized topological charge, making them the first non-magnetic analog of the helical Bloch points found in magnetic skyrmion lattices.</description>

      <title>Low-energy pathways lead to self-healing defects in CsPbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-regulation of free charge carriers in perovskites via Schottky defect formation has been posited as the origin of the well-known defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite materials that are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, like solar cells. Understanding the mechanisms of self-regulation, here for a representative of more commercially viable all-inorganic perovskites, promises to lead to the fabrication of better-performing solar cell materials with higher efficiencies. We investigated different mechanisms and pathways of the diffusion and recombination of interstitials and vacancies (Schottky pairs) in CsPbBr$_3$. We use Nudged Elastic Band calculations and ab initio-derived pseudopotentials within Quantum ESPRESSO to determine energies of formation, migration, and activation for these defects. Our calculations uncover defect pathways capable of producing an activation energy at or below the value of 0.53~eV observed for the slow, temperature-dependent recovery of light-induced conductivity in CsPbBr$_3$. Our work reveals the existence of a low-energy diffusion pathway involving a concerted "domino effect" interstitial mechanism, with the net result that interstitials can diffuse more readily over long distances than expected. Importantly, this observation suggests that defect self-healing can be promoted if the "domino effect" strategy can be engaged.</description>

      <title>Role of stacking defects on the magnetic behavior of CrCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of van der Waals-layered magnetic materials, the properties of CrCl$_3$ continue to attract attention. This compound is reported to undergo antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below $\sim$14 K, with a ferromagneticlike region proposed to exist between 14 and 17 K. Ideally, the crystal structure is rhombohedral (R) below $\sim$235 K, separated from a higher-temperature monoclinic (M) phase by a layer-sliding structural phase transition. However, the structural transition is often inhibited even in bulk single crystals, allowing M-type layer stacking, reported to have a tenfold greater interlayer magnetic coupling than R-type stacking, to be present at low temperature. To clarify the effect of stacking defects on CrCl$_3$, we report magnetization measurements on samples of varying crystalline quality. At low applied magnetic field, some crystals predominantly show the $T_N=14$ K peak, but other crystals show hysteretic behavior and a magnetization enhancement at a slightly higher temperature ($14 &lt; T \lesssim 17$ K.) Samples with anomalous behavior exhibit a transition around $\sim$2 T in isothermal magnetization-field data, providing evidence that M-type stacking defects are the source of these anomalies. Ground powder samples are especially likely to show strongly anomalous behavior. We suggest that the anomalous behavior arises from few-layer magnetic domains that form just above $T_N$ in an environment of mixed interlayer magnetic coupling strength. We argue that the influence of M-type stacking boundaries on sublattice magnetization is already observable in reported neutron scattering data, and may be responsible for a certain feature in reported specific heat data.</description>

      <title>Preservation of Topological Surface States in Millimeter-Scale Transferred Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin topological insulator membranes are building blocks of exotic quantum matter. However, traditional epitaxy of these materials does not facilitate stacking in arbitrary orders, while mechanical exfoliation from bulk crystals is also challenging due to the non-negligible interlayer coupling therein. Here we liberate millimeter-scale films of topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, down to 3 quintuple layers. We characterize the preservation of the topological surface states and quantum well states in transferred Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Leveraging the photon-energy-dependent surface sensitivity, the photoemission spectra taken with $6$ eV and $21.2$ eV photons reveal a transfer-induced migration of the topological surface states from the top to the inner layers. By establishing clear electronic structures of the transferred films and unveiling the wavefunction relocation of the topological surface states, our work paves the physics foundation crucial for the future fabrication of artificially stacked topological materials with single-layer precision.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of Plastically Deformed SrTiO3 and KTaO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation engineering has the potential to open new avenues toward the exploration and modification of the properties of quantum materials. Strontium titanate (SrTiO3, STO) and potassium tantalate (KTaO3, KTO) are incipient ferroelectrics that show metallization and superconductivity at extremely low charge carrier concentrations, and have been the subject of resurgent interest. These materials also exhibit remarkable ambient-temperature ductility, and thus represent exceptional platforms for studies of the effects of deformation-induced dislocation structures on electronic properties. Recent work on plastically deformed STO revealed an enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature and the emergence of local ferroelectricity and magnetism near self-organized dislocation walls. Here we present a comprehensive structural analysis of plastically deformed STO and KTO, employing specially designed strain cells, diffuse neutron and x-ray scattering, Raman scattering, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Diffuse scattering and NMR provide insight into the dislocation configurations and densities and their dependence on strain. As in the prior work on STO, Raman scattering reveals evidence for local ferroelectric order near dislocation walls in plastically deformed KTO. Our findings provide valuable information about the self-organized defect structures in both materials, and they position KTO as a second model system with which to explore the associated emergent physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use photo-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and first-principles calculations to identify and explain the properties of carbon in AlN. We present clear evidence for carbon substitution on the nitrogen site (C$_{\rm N}$). We also clarify the origin of a widely observed EPR spectra in AlN that, although often attributed to a deep donor defect, we demonstrate is surprisingly due to C$_{\rm N}$. Finally, we show the presence of C$_{\rm N}$ is consistent with the absorption spectra at 4.7 eV observed in AlN.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic order in single crystalline EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ thin films using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. Resonant elastic x-ray scattering experiments reveal a sharp magnetic peak at $q = (0, 0, \frac{1}{2})$ below $T_N = 7.2$ K, indicative of interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering. Additionally, we observe a weak diffuse magnetic signal centered at $q = (0, 0, 1)$ that persists above $T_N$, up to $T_C \sim 11$ K. Our Monte-Carlo simulations of a classical spin model approximation of the Eu magnetic sublattice demonstrate that the diffuse signal can arise from ferromagnetic coupling in the top few layers due to surface oxidation. On the other hand, the bulk of the sample exhibits antiferromagnetic coupling between layers. Finally, our fit of the model parameters to the magnetic ordering temperatures, shed light on the exchange couplings that are key in stabilizing the observed composite magnetic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Xu et al. introduced the concept of an interband character for a time-dependent quantum system. This quantity is gauge invariant and quantized as integer values, analogous to the Euler characteristic based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a manifold with a smooth boundary. In this work, we find that the geometric shift vector in momentum space from shift currents in the bulk photovoltaic effect is equivalent to the quantum geometric potential and plays the role of geodesic curvature, that is, of a quantum system whose parameter space is the Bloch momentum. We reveal the intricate relationships among geometric quantities such as the shift vector, Berry curvature, and quantum metric. Additionally, we present the Wilson representation for the quantized interband character and extend our analysis to bosonic photon and phonon drag shift vectors with non-vertical transitions. The application of Wilson loop method facilitates first-principles calculations, providing insights into the geometric underpinnings of these interband gauge invariant quantities and shedding light on their nonlinear optical manifestations in real materials.</description>

      <title>Novel dielectric resonance of composites containing randomly distributed ZrB2 particles with continuous dual-peak microwave absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substantial efforts have been devoted to the elaborate component and microstructure design of absorbents (inclusions) in microwave absorbing (MA) composite materials. However, mesoscopic architectures of composites also play significant roles in prescribing their electromagnetic properties, which are rarely explored in studies of MA materials. Herein, a composite containing randomly distributed ZrB2 particles is fabricated to offer a mesoscopic cluster configuration, which produces a novel dielectric resonance. The resonance disappears and reoccurs when ZrB2 is coated with the insulating and semiconductive ZrO2 layer respectively, suggesting that it is a plasmon resonance excited by the electron transport between ZrB2 particles in clusters rather than any intrinsic resonances of materials constituting the composite. The resonance strength can be regulated by controlling the quantity of the electron transport between particles, which is accomplished by gradually increasing the insulating ZrO2-coated ZrB2 ratio x to disturb the electron transport in ternary disordered composites containing ZrB2 and insulating ZrO2-coated ZrB2. When x exceeds 0.7, the electron transport is cut off completely and the resonance thus disappears. The resonance induces unusual double quarter-wavelength interference cancellations or resonance absorption coupled with quarter-wavelength interference cancellation, giving rise to continuous dual-peak absorption. This work highlights the significance of mesoscopic architectures of composites in MA material design, which can be exploited to prescribe novel electromagnetic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the processes governing the dissociation of excitons to free charge carriers in semiconductors and insulators is of central importance for photovoltaic applications. Dyson's $\mathcal{S}$-matrix formalism provides a framework for computing scattering rates between quasiparticle states derived from the same underlying Hamiltonian, often reducing to familiar Fermi's golden rule like expressions at first order. By presenting a rigorous formalism for multi-channel scattering, we extend this approach to describe scattering between composite quasiparticles and in particular, the process of exciton dissociation mediated by the electron-phonon interaction. Subsequently, we derive rigorous expressions for the exciton dissociation rate, a key quantity of interest in optoelectronic materials, which enforce correct energy conservation and may be readily used in ab initio calculations. We apply our formalism to a three-dimensional model system to compare temperature-dependent exciton rates obtained for different scattering channels.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Terahertz Conductivity and Ultrafast Dynamics of Terahertz Plasmons in Periodic Arrays of Epitaxial Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of plasmons in nanoribbons of (hydrogen intercalated) quasi-free-standing single layer graphene is studied by terahertz spectroscopy both in the steady state and upon photoexcitation by an ultrashort near infrared laser pulse. The use of two-dimensional frequency domain analysis of the optical pump - THz probe signals allows us to determine the evolution of carrier temperature and plasmon characteristics with ~100 fs time resolution. Namely, we find that the carrier temperature decreases from more than 5000 K to the lattice temperature within about 7 ps and that during this evolution the carrier mobility remains practically constant. The time-resolved THz conductivity spectra suggest that graphene nanoribbons contain defects which act as low potential barriers causing a weak localization of charges; the potential barriers are overcome upon photoexcitation. Furthermore, the edges of graphene nanoribbons are found to slightly enhance the scattering of carriers. The results are supported by complementary measurements using THz scanning near-field microscopy which confirm a high uniformity of the THz conductivity across the sample and demonstrate high enough sensitivity to resolve even the impact of nanometric terrace steps on SiC substrate under the graphene monolayer.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial strain effects on the Fermi surface and quantum mobility of the Dirac nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZrSiS has been identified as an exemplary Dirac nodal-line semimetal, in which the Dirac band crossings extend along a closed loop in momentum space. Recently, the topology of the Fermi surface of ZrSiS was uncovered in great detail by quantum oscillation studies. For a magnetic field along the tetragonal $c$ axis, a rich frequency spectrum was observed stemming from the principal electron and hole pockets, and multiple magnetic breakdown orbits. In this work we use uniaxial strain as a tuning parameter for the Fermi surface and the low energy excitations. We measure the magnetoresistance of a single crystal under tensile (up to 0.34 %) and compressive (up to -0.28 %) strain exerted along the $a$ axis and in magnetic fields up to 30 T. We observe a systematic weakening of the peak structure in the Shubnikov-de Haas frequency spectrum upon changing from compressive to tensile strain. This effect may be explained by a decrease in the effective quantum mobility upon decreasing the $c/a$ ratio, which is corroborated by a concurrent increase in the Dingle temperature.</description>

      <title>Drastic modification in thermal conductivity of TiCoSb Half-Heusler alloy: Phonon engineering by lattice softening and ionic polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A drastic variation in thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) for synthesized samples (TiCoSb1+x, x=0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06) is observed and ~47% reduction in \k{appa} is reported for TiCoSb1.02 sample. In depth structural analysis is performed, employing mixed-phase Rietveld refinement technique. Embedded phases and vacancy are analyzed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy data. Local structures of the synthesized samples are explored for the first time by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for TiCoSb system and corroborated with Rietveld refinement data. Lattice dynamics are revealed using Raman Spectroscopy (RS) measurements in unprecedented attempts for TiCoSb system. XRD and RS data accomplishes that variation in \k{appa} as a function of Sb concentration is observed owing to an alteration in phonon group velocity related to lattice softening. Polar nature of TiCoSb HH sample is revealed. LO-TO splitting (related to polar optical phonon scattering) in phonon vibration is observed due to polar nature of TiCoSb synthesized samples. Tailoring in LO-TO splitting due to screening effect, correlated with Co vacancies is reported for TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Lattice softening and LO-TO splitting lead to decreases in \k{appa}~47% for TiCoSb1.02 synthesized sample.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Force Field for Thermal Oxidation of Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looking back at seven decades of highly extensive application in the semiconductor industry, silicon and its native oxide SiO$_2$ are still at the heart of several technological developments. Recently, the fabrication of ultra-thin oxide layers has become essential for keeping up with trends in down-scaling of nanoelectronic devices and for the realization of novel device technologies. With this comes a need for better understanding of the atomic configuration at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. Classical force fields offer flexible application and relatively low computational costs, however, suffer from limited accuracy. Ab-initio methods give much better results but are extremely costly. Machine learning force fields (MLFF) offer the possibility to combine the benefits of both worlds. We train a MLFF for the simulation of the dry thermal oxidation process of a Si substrate. The training data is generated by density functional theory calculations. The obtained structures are in line with ab-initio simulations as well as with experimental observations. Compared to a classical force field, the most recent reactive force field (reaxFF), the resulting configurations are vastly improved.</description>

      <title>Nuclear quantum effects in structural and elastic properties of cubic silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide, a semiconducting material, has gained importance in the fields of ceramics, electronics, and renewable energy due to its remarkable hardness and resistance. In this study, we delve into the impact of nuclear quantum motion, or vibrational mode quantization, on the structural and elastic properties of 3C-SiC. This aspect, elusive in conventional {\it ab-initio} calculations, is explored through path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations using an efficient tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian. This investigation spans a wide range of temperatures and pressures, including tensile stress, adeptly addressing the quantization and anharmonicity inherent in solid-state vibrational modes. The accuracy of the TB model has been checked by comparison with density-functional-theory calculations at zero temperature. The magnitude of quantum effects is assessed by comparing PIMD outcomes with results obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our investigation uncovers notable reductions of 5%, 10%, and 4% in the elastic constants $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$, respectively, attributed to atomic zero-point oscillations. Consequently, the bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio of 3C-SiC exhibit reduced values by 7% and 5% at low temperature. The persistence of these quantum effects in the material's structural and elastic attributes beyond room temperature underscores the necessity of incorporating nuclear quantum motion for an accurate description of these fundamental properties of SiC.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Burgers Vector of Dislocations with Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of dislocations is essential to understand material properties, but their subsurface dynamics that are representative of bulk phenomena cannot be resolved by conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dark field X-ray microscope (DFXM) was recently demonstrated to image hierarchical structures of bulk dislocations by imaging lattice distortions along the transmitted X-ray diffracted beam using an objective lens. While today's DFXM can effectively map the line vector of dislocations, it still cannot quantify the Burgers vector required to understand dislocation interactions, structures, and energies. Our study formulates a theoretical model of how DFXM images collected along specific scans can be used to directly measure the Burgers vector of a dislocation. By revisiting the "invisibility criteria" from TEM theory, we re-solve this formalism for DFXM and extend it to the geometric-optics model developed for DFXM to evaluate how the images acquired from different scans about a single {hkl} diffraction peak encode the Burgers vector within them. We demonstrate this for edge, screw, and mixed dislocations and discuss the observed symmetries. This work advances our understanding of DFXM to establish its capabilities to connect bulk experiments to dislocation theory and mechanics.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Germanium Tin on Si Avalanche Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate monolithically grown germanium-tin (GeSn) on silicon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for infrared light detection. A relatively thinner Ge buffer design was adopted to allow effective photo carriers to transport from the GeSn absorber to the Si multiplication layer such that clear punch-through behavior and a saturated primary responsivity of 0.3 A/W at 1550 nm were observed before avalanche breakdown in GeSn/Si APDs for the first time. The spectral response covers 1500 to 1700 nm. The measured punch-through and breakdown voltages are 15 and 17 V, respectively. Undisputed multiplication gain was obtained with the maximum value of 4.5 at 77 K, and 1.4 at 250 K, directly in reference to the saturated primary responsivity from the same device rather than a different GeSn p-i-n photodiode in previous reports. A peak responsivity was measured as 1.12 A/W at 1550 nm and 77 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advent of autonomous laboratories, coupled with algorithms for high-throughput screening and active learning, promises to accelerate materials discovery and innovation. As these autonomous systems grow in complexity, the demand for robust and efficient workflow management software becomes increasingly critical. In this paper, we introduce AlabOS, a general-purpose software framework for orchestrating experiments and managing resources, with an emphasis on automated laboratories for materials synthesis and characterization. We demonstrate the implementation of AlabOS in a prototype autonomous materials laboratory. AlabOS features a reconfigurable experiment workflow model, enabling the simultaneous execution of varied workflows composed of modular tasks. Therefore, AlabOS is well-suited to handle the rapidly changing experimental protocols defining the progress of self-driving laboratory development for materials research.</description>

      <title>Atomistic-informed phase field modeling of magnesium twin growth by disconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleation and propagation of disconnections play an essential role during twin growth. Atomistic methods can reveal such small structural features on twin facets and model their motion, yet are limited by the simulation length and time scales. Alternatively, mesoscale modeling approaches (such as the phase field method) address these constraints of atomistic simulations and can maintain atomic-level accuracy when integrated with atomic-level information. In this work, a phase field model is used to simulate the disconnection-mediated twinning, informed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This work considers the specific case of the growth of $\{10\bar{1}2\}$ twin in magnesium. MD simulations are first conducted to obtain the orientation-dependent interface mobility and motion threshold, and to simulate twin embryo growth and collect facet velocities, which can be used for calibrating the continuum model. The phase field disconnections model, based on the principle of minimum dissipation potential, provides the theoretical framework. This model incorporates a nonconvex grain boundary energy, elasticity and shear coupling, and simulates disconnections as a natural emergence under the elastic driving force. The phase field model is further optimized by including the anisotropic interface mobility and motion threshold suggested by MD simulations. Results agree with MD simulations of twin embryo growth in the aspects of final twin thickness, twin shape, and twin size, as well as the kinetic behavior of twin boundaries and twin tips. The simulated twin microstructure is also consistent with experimental observations, demonstrating the fidelity of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and profound studies of actual magnetic domain structure in rare-earth A2Ir2O7 pyrochlore iridates are frequently limited by insufficient sample quality or lack of single crystals. We report the magnetic properties of the for-the-first-time synthesised Lu2Ir2O7 and Er2Ir2O7 single-crystals. The paper is focused on the robust ferromagnetic component of magnetisation present in the material with the antiferromagnetically ordered state of the all-in-all-out (AIAO) type, and is discussed in the framework of AIAO and AOAI domains and interfaces on the geometrically frustrated lattice.</description>

      <title>Magnetic microstructure of nanocrystalline Fe-Nb-B alloys as seen by small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic microstructure of two-phase Fe-Nb-B~based Nanoperm alloys using unpolarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our SANS analysis reveals a significantly large magnetic scattering contribution due to spin misalignment, primarily originating from the substantial jump in the longitudinal magnetization at the interfaces between the particles and the matrix. The magnetic scattering exhibits an angular anisotropy that resembles a clover-leaf-type pattern, consistent with the predictions of micromagnetic SANS theory. Analysis of the one-dimensional SANS data yields values for the exchange-stiffness constant and the average anisotropy and magnetostatic fields. The micromagnetic correlation lengths for all three samples exhibit a similar field variation with sizes ranging between about 10-35 nm. We also find that the nuclear and magnetic residual scattering component of the SANS cross section exhibits a similar $q$ dependency as the SAXS data. These findings further validate the applicability of the micromagnetic SANS theory, and the mesoscopic information obtained is important for the advancement of the soft magnetic properties of this class of material.</description>

      <title>Progress in Developing Highly Efficient p-Type TCOs for Transparent Electronics: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) represent a remarkable class of materials that possess both excellent electrical conductivity and high optical transparency, which are typically considered mutually exclusive in traditional materials. In conventional materials, achieving both high electrical conductivity and optical transparency is difficult. Materials with a wide optical band gap are transparent in the visible region but lack electrical conductivity, while conductive metals are opaque. Hence, the only way to induce both properties in a single material is to create non-stoichiometry and/or defects. By introducing shallow defects near the conduction band for n-type materials and the valence band for p-type materials, it is possible to enhance the conductivity of the material at room temperature. However, developing efficient p-type TCOs has been particularly difficult due to the localized nature of the valence band derived from O 2p orbitals and the challenges associated with shallow acceptors, resulting in large effective mass of holes. While commercially available TCOs are predominantly n-type, such as Sn:In2O3, Al:ZnO, and F:SnO2, the development of efficient p-type TCOs lags. In this review, we have discussed the origin of p-type conductivity in TCOs, and the difficulties encountered in developing efficient p-type materials. We have also demonstrated the fundamental materials physics of p-type TCOs, including electronic structures, doping, defect properties, and optical properties. A range of deposition techniques has been adopted to prepare TCO films, and this review provides a detailed discussion of these techniques and their relative deposition parameters. Overall, we have presented an up-to-date and comprehensive review of different p-type transparent conducting oxide thin films, providing insights into ongoing research and potential future directions in this field.</description>

Abstract: We present VelCrys, a web-based interactive tool, that allows to perform further post-processing of the elastic tensor in order to compute and plot the group velocity of the acoustic waves for any crystal symmetry. We also implemented the calculation of effective magnetic corrections to the elastic tensor and corresponding fractional change in group velocity under a magnetic field. We apply it to dry sandstone, cubic CoPt and hcp Co to show some of the program features. In the analysis of magnetic corrections, we find complex landscapes of fractional change in group velocity as a function of ray direction, as well as a field dependence consistent with Simon effect.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Epitaxial Integration of Single-Crystalline BiSb Topological Insulator on GaAs (111)A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) are promising materials for future spintronics applications and their epitaxial integration would allow the realization of new hybrid interfaces. As the first materials studied, Bismuth Antimony alloys (Bi1-xSbx) show great potential due to their tuneable electronic band structure and efficient charge-to-spin conversion. Here, we report the growth of Bi1-xSbx thin films on GaAs (111)A substrates following two different protocols. For the conventional epitaxy process, the grown films show excellent crystallinity and twin domains corresponding to an in-plane 180{\textdegree} rotation of the crystalline structure. Domain walls are found to be composition-dependent and have a lower density for Antimony-rich films. For the optimized process, depositing an Antimony bilayer prior to BiSb growth allows achieving single crystallinity of the TI films. The topologically protected surface states are evidenced by ex-situ ARPES measurements for domains-free and conventional films. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first large-scale epitaxial integration of single crystalline Bi1-xSbx thin films on industrial substrates.</description>

      <title>Detecting slow magnetization relaxation via magnetotransport measurements based on the current-reversal method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow magnetization relaxation processes are an important time-dependent property of many magnetic materials. We show that magnetotransport measurements based on a well-established current-reversal method can be utilized to implement a simple and robust screening scheme for such relaxation processes. We demonstrate our approach considering the anomalous Hall effect in a Pt/Co/AlOx trilayer model system, and then explore relaxation in {\tau} -MnAl films. Compared to magnetotransport experiments based on ac lock-in techniques, we find that the dc current-reversal method is particulary sensitive to relaxation processes with relaxation time scales on the order of seconds, comparable to the current-reversal measurement time scales.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torque-assisted detection of the canted phase of magnetization in a CoTb-based ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of ferrimagnets in spintronic applications purportedly offers the potential for high-speed and energy-efficient switching of magnetic states, coupled with their notable stability. This collection of characteristics is commonly observed in ferrimagnetic materials that are in close proximity to states of magnetic or angular momentum compensation. This is owing to the presence of two antiparallel ordered magnetic sublattices that exhibit differing responses to variations in temperature or composition. In the vicinity of the magnetic compensation state, an external field has the capacity to disrupt the collinearity between the sublattices, resulting in the codirectionality of the magnetic projections. The existence of the canted phase has been extensively described theoretically, but its experimental investigation remains limited. Here, a violation of antiferromagnetic ordering is detected through a change in the direction of the effective field induced by the spin-orbital torque, without altering the dominant characteristics of the ferrimagnetic structure. This effect is observed both during external heating of the sample and as a consequence of Joule heating with an increase in the transmitted current. In the examined structure of W/Co70Tb30/Ru, the canted phase region is observed at approximately room temperature and at external fields on the order of 0.1 T. Through macrospin modeling and analytical explanations, a correlation between anisotropy, interlattice exchange interaction, and the presence of the canted phase region is established.</description>

      <title>Neutron phase filtering for separating phase- and attenuation signal in aluminium and anodic aluminium oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron imaging has gained significant importance as a material characterisation technique and is particularly useful to visualise hydrogenous materials in objects opaque to other radiations. Particular fields of application include investigations of hydrogen in metals as well as metal corrosion, thanks to the fact that neutrons can penetrate metals better than e.g. X-rays and are at the same time highly sensitive to hydrogen. However at interfaces for example those that are prone to corrosion, refraction effects sometimes obscure the attenuation image, which is used to for hydrogen quantification. Refraction, as a differential phase effect, diverts the neutron beam away from the interface in the image which leads to intensity gain and intensity loss regions, which are superimposed to the attenuation image, thus obscuring the interface region and hindering quantitative analyses of e.g. hydrogen content in the vicinity of the interface or in an oxide layer. For corresponding effects in X-ray imaging, a phase filter approach was developed and is generally based on transport-of-intensity considerations. Here, we compare such an approach, that has been adapted to neutrons, with another simulation-based assessment using the ray-tracing software McStas. The latter appears superior and promising for future extensions which enable fitting forward models via simulations in order to separate phase and attenuation effects and thus pave the way for overcoming quantitative limitations at refracting interfaces.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for Advanced Nanoscale X-ray Analysis: Unmixing Multicomponent Signals and Enhancing Chemical Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope is a key tool for nanomaterials analysis, providing a direct link between spatial and chemical information. However, using it for precisely determining chemical compositions presents challenges of noisy data from low X-ray yields and mixed signals from phases that overlap along the electron beam trajectory. Here, we introduce a novel method, non-negative matrix factorisation based pan-sharpening (PSNMF), to address these limitations. Leveraging the Poisson nature of EDX spectral noise and binning operations, PSNMF retrieves high quality phase spectral and spatial signatures via consecutive factorisations. After validating PSNMF with synthetic datasets of different noise levels, we illustrate its effectiveness on two distinct experimental cases: a nano-mineralogical lamella, and supported catalytic nanoparticles. Not only does PSNMF obtain accurate phase signatures, datasets reconstructed from the outputs have demonstrably lower noise and better fidelity than from the benchmark denoising method of principle component analysis.</description>

      <title>Development of a Gaussian Approximation Potential to Study Structure and Thermodynamics of Nickel Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) potentials such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in mapping structure to properties across diverse systems. Here, we introduce a GAP model for low-dimensional Ni nanoclusters and demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness in capturing the energetics, structural diversity and thermodynamic properties of Ni nanoclusters across a broad size range. Through a systematic approach encompassing model development, validation, and application, we evaluate the model's efficacy in representing energetics and configurational features in low-dimensional regimes, while also examining its extrapolative nature to vastly different spatiotemporal regimes. Our analysis and discussion shed light on the data quality required to effectively train such models. Trajectories from large scale MD simulations using the GAP model analyzed with data-driven models like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) reveal intriguing insights into the size-dependent phase behavior and thermo-mechanical stability characteristics of porous Ni nanoparticles. Overall, our work underscores the potential of ML models which coupled with data-driven approaches serve as versatile tools for studying low-dimensional systems and complex material dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for predicting induced-stress distributions in polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple micromechanical model of polycrystalline materials is proposed, which enables us to swiftly produce grain-boundary-stress distributions induced by the uniform external loading (in the elastic strain regime). Such statistical knowledge of local stresses is a necessary prerequisite to assess the probability for intergranular cracking initiation. Model predictions are verified through finite element calculations for various loading configurations, material properties, and grain-boundary types specified by the properties of a bicrystal pair of grains enclosing the grain boundary.</description>

      <title>Topological Weyl Altermagnetism in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a novel, third fundamental class of collinear magnetic ordered materials, alongside with ferro- and antiferromagnets. They share with conventional antiferromagnets the feature of a vanishing net magnetization. At the same time they show a spin-splitting of electronic bands, just as in ferromagnets, caused by the atomic exchange interaction. Interestingly, the altermagnetic spin-splitting may in principle allow for topological electronic structures far beyond collinear antiferromagnets with spin-degenerate bands. Here, using high-resolution and spin angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the momentum-dependent spin-splitting in altermagnetic CrSb reaches up to 1 eV, while vanishing at high symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. We find it causes spin-carrying altermagnetic Weyl points, and observe their protected Fermi-arc surface states. This establishes that in altermagnets the large energy scale intrinsic to the spin-splitting - orders of magnitude larger that the relativistic spin-orbit coupling - creates its own realm of robust electronic topology, with spin-polarized topological surface states that are altermagnetic.</description>

      <title>Construction and sampling of alloy cluster expansions -- A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline alloys and related mixed systems make up a large family of materials with high tunability which have been proposed as the solution to a large number of energy related materials design problems. Due to the presence of chemical order and disorder in these systems, neither experimental efforts nor ab-initio computational methods alone are sufficient to span the inherently large configuration space. Therefore, fast and accurate models are necessary. To this end, cluster expansions have been widely and successfully used for the past decades. Cluster expansions are generalized Ising models designed to predict the energy of any atomic configuration of a system after training on a small subset of the available configurations. Constructing and sampling a cluster expansion consists of multiple steps that have to be performed with care. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive guide to this process, highlighting important considerations and potential pitfalls. The tutorial consists of three parts, starting with cluster expansion construction for a relatively simple system, continuing with strategies for more challenging systems such as surfaces and closing with examples of Monte Carlo sampling of cluster expansions to study order-disorder transitions and phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Quantitative kinetic rules for plastic strain-induced $\alpha$-$\omega$ phase transformation in Zr under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic strain-induced phase transformations (PTs) and chemical reactions under high pressure are broadly spread in modern technologies, friction and wear, geophysics, and astrogeology. However, because of very heterogeneous fields of plastic strain $\mathbf{E}^{p}$ and stress $\mathbf{\sigma}$ tensors and volume fraction $c$ of phases in a sample compressed in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) and impossibility of measurements of $\mathbf{\sigma}$ and $\mathbf{E}^{p}$, there are no strict kinetic equations for them. Here, we develop combined experimental-computational approaches to determine all fields in strongly plastically predeformed Zr and kinetic equation for $\alpha$-$\omega$ PT consistent with experimental data for the entire sample. Kinetic equation depends on accumulated plastic strain (instead of time) and pressure and is independent of plastic strain and deviatoric stress tensors, i.e., it can be applied for various above processes. Our results initiate kinetic studies of strain-induced PTs and provide efforts toward more comprehensive understanding of material behavior in extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>A noncollinear density functional theory ansatz for the phononic and thermodynamic properties of $\alpha$-Pu</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plutonium's phase diagram is host to complex structures and interactions that make the description of its ground state properties elusive. Using all-electron density functional theory, we study the thermodynamic properties of $\alpha$-Pu. To do this, we build on recent work in the literature by introducing a novel noncollinear magnetic ansatz for $\alpha$-Pu's ground state. The noncollinear ansatz accurately recovers the experimental phonon density of states, heat capacity, and thermal expansion. These new results on $\alpha$-Pu along with recent results on $\delta$-Pu demonstrate the efficacy of noncollinear ansatzes for the description of plutonium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to evaluate the Gibbs free energy from constant-volume first-principles calculations. The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Gr\"uneisen parameter without varying the volume. As an example, the validity of our method is demonstrated for fcc-Al by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation that is much more computationally-demanding.</description>

      <title>Why Scanning Tunneling Microscopy on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ sometimes doesn't see the superconducting gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is perhaps the most promising way to detect the superconducting gap size and structure in the canonical unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ directly. However, in many cases, researchers have reported being unable to detect the gap at all in simple STM conductance measurements. Recently, an investigation of this issue on various local topographic structures on a Sr-terminated surface found that superconducting spectra appeared only in the region of small nanoscale canyons, corresponding to the removal of one RuO surface layer. Here, we analyze the electronic structure of various possible surface structures using first principles methods, and argue that bulk conditions favorable for superconductivity can be achieved when removal of the RuO layer suppresses the RuO$_4$ octahedral rotation locally. We further propose alternative terminations to the most frequently reported Sr termination where superconductivity surfaces should be observed.</description>

      <title>Simulating optically-active spin defects with a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a pressing need for more accurate computational simulations of the opto-electronic properties of defects in materials to aid in the development of quantum sensing platforms. In this work, we explore how quantum computers could be effectively utilized for this purpose. Specifically, we develop fault-tolerant quantum algorithms to simulate optically active defect states and their radiative emission rates. We employ quantum defect embedding theory to translate the Hamiltonian of a defect-containing supercell into a smaller, effective Hamiltonian that accounts for dielectric screening effects. Our approach integrates block-encoding of the dipole operator with quantum phase estimation to selectively sample the optically active excited states that exhibit the largest dipole transition amplitudes. We also provide estimates of the quantum resources required to simulate a negatively-charged boron vacancy in a hexagonal boron nitride cluster. We conclude by offering a forward-looking perspective on the potential of quantum computers to enhance quantum sensor capabilities and identify specific scenarios where quantum computing can resolve problems traditionally challenging for classical computers.</description>

Abstract: Lead-free Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.10Ti0.90O3 (BCZT) ceramics with different BaO-Na2O-Nb2O5-WO3-P2O5 (BNNWP) glass content, forming (1-x)BCZT-xBNNWP lead-free ceramics (abbreviated as BCZTx; x=0, 2, 4, 6, and 8wt%) were synthesized using the conventional solid-state processing route. The XRD investigation shows the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases in BCZT pure. Likewise, only the tetragonal phase was detected in BCZTx (x = 2-8 wt%) ceramics. The SEM findings indicate that the average grain size decreases as the amount of BNNWP glass additives increases. In addition, BCZT ceramics Amodified with glass additions showed narrower hysteresis loops and a large electric field. The BCZT4 showed the highest recovered energy density of 0.52 J/cm3 at 135kV/cm with an energy storage efficiency of 62.4%, which is increased by 6.6 compared to BCZT0 (0.075 J/cm3). The energy density was also calculated using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <title>Spinons in a new Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnet Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the elusive spinon excitations in quantum spin liquid (QSL) materials is what scientists have long sought for. Recently, thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) has emerged to be a decisive probe because the fermionic nature of spinons leads to a characteristic nonzero linear $\kappa_0/T$ term while approaching zero Kelvin. So far, only a few systems have been reported to exhibit such term. Here, we report a $\kappa_0/T \approx$ 0.01 WK$^{-2}$m$^{-1}$, the largest $\kappa_0/T$ value ever observed in magnetic oxide QSL candidates, in a new quantum magnet Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ with a Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL). Its QSL nature is further supported by the power-law temperature dependence of the specific heat, a plateau of muon spin relaxation rate, and gapless inelastic neutron spectra. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of XY spin anisotropy is the key for Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ to be the first QSL realized on the SSL, after more than four decades of extensive studies on this celebrated magnetically frustrated lattice.</description>

      <title>Origin of the mm-submm loss in deposited dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-loss deposited dielectrics are beneficial for the advancement of superconducting integrated circuits for astronomy. In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1-10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1-1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27-100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.</description>

      <title>Impurity-level induced broadband photoelectric response in wide-band semiconductor SrSnO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband spectrum detectors exhibit great promise in fields such as multispectral imaging and optical communications. Despite significant progress, challenges like materials instability, complex manufacturing process and high costs still hinder further application. Here we present a method that achieves broadband spectral detect by impurity-level in SrSnO3. We report over 200 mA/W photo-responsivity at 275 nm (ultraviolet C solar-bind) and 367 nm (ultraviolet A) and ~ 1 mA/W photo-responsivity at 532 nm and 700 nm (visible) with a voltage bias of 5V. Further transport and photoluminescence results indicate that the broadband response comes from the impurity levels and mutual interactions. Additionally, the photodetector demonstrates excellent robustness and stability under repeated tests and prolonged exposure in air. These findings show the potential of SSO photodetectors and propose a method to achieve broadband spectrum detection, creating new possibility for the development of single-phase, low-cost, simple structure and high-efficiency photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Extension of the SpK Atomic Physics Code to Generate Global Equation of State Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global microphysics models are required for the modelling of high-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments, the improvement of which are critical to the path to inertial fusion energy. This work presents further developments to the atomic and microphysics code, SpK, part of the numerical modelling suite of Imperial College London and First Light Fusion. We extend the capabilities of SpK to allow the calculation of the equation of state (EoS). The detailed configuration accounting calculations are interpolated into finite-temperature Thomas-Fermi calculations at high coupling to form the electronic component of the model. The Cowan model provides the ionic contribution, modified to approximate the physics of diatomic molecular dissociation. By utilising bonding corrections and performing a Maxwell construction, SpK captures the EoS from states ranging from the zero-pressure solid, through the liquid-vapour coexistence region and into plasma states. This global approach offers the benefit of capturing electronic shell structure over large regions of parameter space, building highly-resolved tables in minutes on a simple desktop. We present shock Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot calculations for a number of materials, comparing SpK to other models and experimental data. We also apply EoS and opacity data generated by SpK in integrated simulations of indirectly-driven capsule implosions, highlighting physical sensitivities to the choice of EoS models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.</description>

      <title>Effect of boundary roughness on the attenuation of specular phonon reflection in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduced phonon specularity $p$ from boundary roughness scattering plays a major role in the lower thermal conductivity in semiconducting and insulating nanowires and films. Although the well-known Ziman formula $p=\exp(-4\sigma^{2}q_{x}^{2})$, where $\sigma$ and $q_{x}$ denote the root-mean-square boundary roughness and the normal component of the incident phonon wave vector, respectively, and its variants are commonly used in the literature to estimate how roughness attenuates $p$, their validity and accuracy remain poorly understood, especially when the effects of mode conversion cannot be ignored. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy and validity of the more general Ogilvy formula, from which the Ziman formula is derived, by comparing its predictions to the $p$ values computed from Atomistic Green's Function (AGF) simulations for an ensemble of rough boundaries in single-layer graphene. The effects of phonon dispersion, incident angle, polarization, mode conversion, and correlation length are analyzed. Our results suggest that the Ogilvy formula is remarkably accurate for $0&lt;q_{x}&lt;\frac{\pi}{4\sigma}$ when the lateral correlation length $L$ is large or the phonon is at normal incidence. At large $q_{x}$ in the short-wavelength limit, the $q_{x}$-dependence of $p$ becomes significantly weaker. In the large-$L$ limit, the numerical results suggest the existence of a minimum $p$ for short-wavelength phonons, given by $p\sim p_{0}\exp(-\pi^{2}/4)$, where $p_{0}$ is the baseline specularity for the ideal boundary.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional Noble Metal-free Ternary Chalcogenide Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen has been identified as a clean, zero carbon, sustainable, and promising energy source for the future, and electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production is an emission-free, efficient energy conversion technology. A major limitation of this approach is the unavailability of efficient, abundant, inexpensive catalysts, which prompts the need for new catalytic materials. Here, we report the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of a novel transition metal-based ternary chalcogenide family, LaMS$_3$ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Powder X-ray diffraction confirms the phase purity of these materials, while composition analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the presence of the stoichiometric ratio of elements in these compounds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used to study the chemical states on the surface and in bulk, respectively. These materials exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity towards the two half-reactions of the water-splitting process, with LaNiS$_3$ being the most active material for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The LaMS$_3$ compounds show long-term stability with negligible change in the overpotential at a constant current density of 10 mA cm$^{-2}$ over 18 hours of measurements. As compared to the corresponding ternary oxides, the LaMS$_3$ materials exhibit higher activity and significantly lower Tafel slopes. The ability to catalyze both half-reactions of water electrolysis makes these materials promising candidates for bifunctional catalysts and presents a new avenue to search for high-efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states related with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Concurrence of directional Kondo transport and incommensurate magnetic order in the layered material AgCrSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the concurrent emergence of the directional Kondo behavior and incommensurate magnetic ordering in a layered material. We employ temperature- and magnetic field-dependent resistivity measurements, susceptibility measurements, and high resolution wavelength X-ray diffraction spectroscopy to study the electronic properties of AgCrSe$_2$. Impurity Kondo behavior with a characteristic temperature of $T_\text K$ = 32 K is identified through quantitative analysis of the in-plane resistivity, substantiated by magneto-transport measurements. The agreement between our experimental data and the Schlottmann's scaling theory allows us to determine the impurity spin as $S$ = 3/2. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the Kondo behavior and its relation to the material's antiferromagnetic transition. Our study uncovers an unusual phenomenon -- the equivalence of the N\'eel temperature and the Kondo temperature -- paving the way for further investigations into the intricate interplay between impurity physics and magnetic phenomena in quantum materials, with potential applications in advanced electronic and magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Search for inhomogeneous Meissner screening in Nb induced by low-temperature surface treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical surface treatments, such as low-temperature baking (LTB) in a gaseous atmosphere or in vacuum, are important for the surface preparation of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. These treatments inhomogeneously dope the first $\sim$50 nm of Nb's subsurface and are expected to impart depth-dependent characteristics to its Meissner response; however, direct evidence supporting this remains elusive, suggesting the effect is subtle. In this work, we revisit the Meissner profile data for several LTB treatments obtained from low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mu$SR) experiments [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 072601 (2014) and R. M. L. McFadden et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 044018 (2023)], and search for signatures of inhomogeneous field screening. Using a generalized London expression with a recently proposed empirical model for a depth-dependent magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(z)$, we obtain improved fits to the Meissner data, revealing that the presence of a non-superconducting surface "dead layer" $d \geq 25$ nm is a strong indicator of a reduced supercurrent density at shallow subsurface depths. Our analysis supports the notion that vacuum annealing at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h induces a depth-dependent Meissner response, which has consequences for Nb's ability to maintain a magnetic-flux-free state. Evidence of similar behavior from a "nitrogen infusion" treatment is less compelling. Suggestions for further investigation into the matter are provided.</description>

Abstract: Recently, topolectrical circuits (TECs) boom in studying the topological states of matter. The resemblance between circuit Laplacians and tight-binding models in condensed matter physics allows for the exploration of exotic topological phases on the circuit platform. In this review, we begin by presenting the basic equations for the circuit elements and units, along with the fundamentals and experimental methods for TECs. Subsequently, we retrospect the main literature in this field, encompassing the circuit realization of (higher-order) topological insulators and semimetals. Due to the abundant electrical elements and flexible connections, many unconventional topological states like the non-Hermitian, nonlinear, non-Abelian, non-periodic, non-Euclidean, and higher-dimensional topological states that are challenging to observe in conventional condensed matter physics, have been observed in circuits and summarized in this review. Furthermore, we show the capability of electrical circuits for exploring the physical phenomena in other systems, such as photonic and magnetic ones. Importantly, we highlight TEC systems are convenient for manufacture and miniaturization because of their compatibility with the traditional integrated circuits. Finally, we prospect the future directions in this exciting field, and connect the emerging TECs with the development of topology physics, (meta)material designs, and device applications.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Neural Networks for Reversible Dissipative Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting properties of layered materials can be controlled by thinning, stacking, and twisting, demanding investigation of electronic states by spectroscopic means at the nanometer scale. Here, we reveal the spatial variations of the electronic states in heterostructures of the superconducting monolayer NbSe$_2$/graphene using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. The NbSe$_2$ monolayer grown by molecular beam epitaxy is naturally twisted with respect to the graphene substrate and exhibits interference patterns of Bogoliubov quasiparticles twisted with respect to the NbSe$_2$ and graphene lattices. We find that the twisted interference patterns originate from a sextet of regions in momentum space where the Fermi surfaces of NbSe$_2$ and graphene overlap. The Fermi surface overlap is sensitive to the twist angle, providing a knob to tune superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of orbital ordering in cooperative Jahn-Teller models: Machine-learning enabled large-scale simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning (ML) force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Large scale dynamical simulations of the JT model also shed light on the orbital ordering dynamics in colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The JT effect in these materials describes the distortion of local oxygen octahedra driven by a coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom of $e_g$ electrons. An effective electron-mediated interaction between the local JT modes leads to a structural transition and the emergence of long-range orbital order at low temperatures. Assuming the principle of locality, a deep-learning neural-network model is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced forces that drive the dynamical evolution of JT phonons. A group-theoretical method is utilized to develop a descriptor that incorporates the combined orbital and lattice symmetry into the ML model. Large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening dynamics of the composite JT distortion and orbital order after a thermal quench. The late-stage coarsening of orbital domains exhibits pronounced freezing behaviors which are likely related to the unusual morphology of the domain structures. Our work highlights a promising avenue for multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</description>

Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) materials are widely studied, and yet their atomic-scale structures remain to be fully understood. Here we show that the chemical and configurational space of GO can be rapidly explored by advanced machine-learning methods, combining on-the-fly acceleration for first-principles molecular dynamics with message-passing neural-network potentials. The first step allows for the rapid sampling of chemical structures with very little prior knowledge required; the second step affords state-of-the-art accuracy and predictive power. We apply the method to the thermal reduction of GO, which we describe in a realistic (ten-nanometre scale) structural model. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental findings and help to rationalise them in atomistic and mechanistic detail. More generally, our work provides a platform for routine, accurate, and predictive simulations of diverse carbonaceous materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $1T$-TiSe$_2$ is believed to posses a soft electronic mode, i.e., plasmon or exciton, that might be responsible for the exciton condensation and charge-density-wave (CDW) transition. Here, we explore collective electronic excitations in single-layer $1T$-TiSe$_2$ by using the ab-initio electromagnetic linear response and unveil intricate scattering pathways of two-dimensional (2D) plasmon mode near the CDW phase. We found the dominant role of plasmon-phonon scattering, which in combination with the CDW gap excitations leads to the anomalous temperature dependence of the plasmon linewidth across the CDW transition. Below the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$ a strong hybridization between 2D plasmon and CDW excitations is obtained. These optical features are highly tunable due to temperature-dependent CDW-related modifications of electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling and make CDW-bearing systems potentially interesting for applications in optoelectronics and low-loss plasmonics.</description>

      <title>A quantitative phase-field model for void evolution in defect supersaturated environments: a novel introduction of defect reaction asymmetry</title>

Abstract: Voids develop in crystalline materials under energetic particle irradiation, as in nuclear reactors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of void nucleation and growth is of utmost importance as it leads to dimensional instability of the metallic materials. In the past two decades, researchers have adopted the phase-field approach to study the phenomena of void evolution under irradiation. The approach involves modeling the boundary between the void and matrix with a diffused interface. However, none of the existing models are quantitative in nature. This work introduces a thermodynamically consistent, quantitative diffuse interface model based on KKS formalism to describe the void evolution under irradiation. The model concurrently considers both vacancies and self-interstitials in the description of void evolution. Unique to our model is the presence of two mobility parameters in the equation of motion of the phase-field variable. The two mobility parameters relate the driving force for vacancy and self-interstitial interaction to the interface motion, analogous to dislocation motion through climb and glide processes. The asymptotic matching of the phase-field model with the sharp-interface theory fixes the two mobility parameters in terms of the material parameters in the sharp-interface model. The Landau coefficient, which controls the height of the double-well function in the phase field variable, and the gradient coefficient of the phase field variable are fixed based on the interfacial energy and interface width of the boundary. With all the parameters in the model determined in terms of the material parameters, we thus have a new phase field model for void evolution. Simple test cases will show the void evolution under various defect supersaturation to validate our new phase-field model.</description>

      <title>Assessing the SCAN functional for deep defects and small polarons in wide-bandgap semiconductors and insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the recently developed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional, now widely used in calculations of many materials, is not able to reliably describe the properties of deep defects and small polarons in a set of wide-bandgap semiconductors and insulators (ZnO, ZnSe, GaN, Ga$_2$O$_3$, and NaF). By comparing first-principles calculations using the SCAN functional against established experimental information and first-principles calculations using a hybrid functional, we find that the SCAN functional systematically underestimates the magnitude of the structural distortions at deep defects and tends to delocalize the charge density of these defect states.</description>

      <title>Homopolar Chemical Bonds Induce In-Plane Anisotropy in Layered Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Main-group layered binary semiconductors, in particular, the III-VI alloys in the binary Ga-Te system are attracting increasing interest for a range of practical applications. The III-VI semiconductor, monoclinic gallium monotelluride (m-GaTe), has been recently used in high-sensitivity photodetectors/phototransistors and electronic memory applications due to its anisotropic properties yielding superior optical and electrical performance. Despite these applications, the origin of such anisotropy, namely the complex structural and bonding environments in GaTe nanostructures remain to be fully understood. In the present work, we report a comprehensive atomic-scale characterization of m-GaTe by state-of-the-art element-resolved atomic-scale microscopy experiments, enabling a direct measure of the in-plane anisotropy at the sub-Angstrom level. We show that these experimental images compare well with the results of first-principles modeling. Quantum-chemical bonding analyses provide a detailed picture of the atomic neighbor interactions within the layers, revealing that vertical Ga-Ga homopolar bonds get stronger when they are distorted and rotated, inducing the strong in-plane anisotropy. Beyond GaTe, using a systematic screening over the Materials Project database, we identify four additional low-symmetric layered crystals with similar distorted tetrahedral patterns, namely, GeP, GeAs, SiP, and SiAs. We thereby confirm the homopolar-bond-induced anisotropy is a more generic feature in these layered van-der-Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Atomic multiplet and charge-transfer screening effects in 1$s$ and 2$p$ core-level X-ray photoelectron spectra of early 3$d$ transition-metal oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of 1$s$ and 2$p$ core-level hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) spectra in metallic VO$_2$ and CrO$_2$. Even though the V 1$s$ and 2$p$ spectra in VO$_2$ display similar line shapes except the absence or presence of a spin-orbit coupling splitting, the Cr 1$s$ and 2$p$ spectra exhibit distinct main-line shapes. The experimental HAXPES spectra are analyzed by the Anderson impurity model based on the density functional theory + dynamical mean-field theory and a conventional MO$_6$ cluster model. We elucidate the complex interplay between formation of the intra-atomic multiplet and charge transfer effect on the chemical bonding followed by the 1$s$ and 2$p$ core electron excitations. We demonstrate the advantage of the 1$s$ excitations to the routinely-employed 2$p$ excitations for distinguishing between metal-ligand and metal-metal charge transfer contributions in early 3$d$ transition-metal oxides.</description>

Abstract: Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces (stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains.</description>

      <title>Thermal boundary conductance of metal diamond interfaces predicted by machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

Abstract: Thermal boundary conductance (TBC) across metal diamond interfaces plays a critical role in the thermal management of future diamond based ultrawide bandgap semiconductor devices. Molecular dynamics is a sophisticated method to predict TBC but is limited by the lack of reliable potential describing metal diamond interfaces. In this work, we report the development of machine learning interatomic potentials and the prediction of TBCs of several technologically promising metal diamond interfaces using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. The predicted TBCs of Al, Zr, Mo, and Au-diamond interfaces are approximately 316, 88, 52, and 55 MW/m2K, respectively, after quantum corrections. The corresponding thermal boundary resistances are equivalent to 0.8 {\mu}m thick of Al, 1.4 {\mu}m Mo, 0.3 {\mu}m Zr, and 5.3 {\mu}m Au, respectively. We also find that the conventional simple models, such as the acoustic mismatch model and diffuse mismatch model, even including the full-band phonon dispersion from first principles, largely misestimate the TBC values because of their inability to include inelastic transmission as well as interfacial structural and bonding details. The quantum-corrected TBC values for the metal diamond interfaces correlate well with the quantum corrected phonon specific heat of metals, instead of diamond. Additionally, our comparative analysis of Debye temperature and elastic modulus in these systems reveals that the former parameter correlates more strongly with the TBC than the latter. These low TBC values need to be considered in future diamond based semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Importance of hyper-parameter optimization during training of physics-informed deep learning networks</title>

Abstract: Incorporating scientific knowledge into deep learning (DL) models for materials-based simulations can constrain the network's predictions to be within the boundaries of the material system. Altering loss functions or adding physics-based regularization (PBR) terms to reflect material properties informs a network about the physical constraints the simulation should obey. The training and tuning process of a DL network greatly affects the quality of the model, but how this process differs when using physics-based loss functions or regularization terms is not commonly discussed. In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly, it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically, each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strength, ductility, and failure properties of metals are tailored by plastic deformation routes. Predicting these properties requires modeling of the structural dynamics and stress evolution taking place on several length scales. Progress has been hampered by a lack of representative 3D experimental data at industrially relevant degrees of deformation. We present an X-ray imaging based 3D mapping of an aluminum polycrystal deformed to the ultimate tensile strength (32% elongation). The extensive dataset reveals significant intra-grain stress variations (36 MPa) up to at least half of the inter-grain variations (76 MPa), which are dominated by grain orientation effects. Local intra-grain stress concentrations are candidates for damage nucleation. Such data are important for models of structure-property relations and damage.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Surface Descriptor Quantifying the Correlations between Anomalous Hall Effect and Fermi Surface Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material science focusing on geometry. Here we investigate the relation between the geometrical type of the Fermi surface and Anomalous and Spin Hall Effects. An index, $\mathbb{H}_F$, quantifying the hyperbolic geometry of the Fermi surface, shows a universal correlation (R$^2$ = 0.97) with the experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ = 0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi surfaces' geometries, opening horizon for prediction of phenomena beyond topological understanding.</description>

      <title>LTAU-FF: Loss Trajectory Analysis for Uncertainty in Atomistic Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model ensembles are effective tools for estimating prediction uncertainty in deep learning atomistic force fields. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by high computational costs and overconfident error estimates. In this work, we address these challenges by leveraging distributions of per-sample errors obtained during training and employing a distance-based similarity search in the model latent space. Our method, which we call LTAU, efficiently estimates the full probability distribution function (PDF) of errors for any test point using the logged training errors, achieving speeds that are 2--3 orders of magnitudes faster than typical ensemble methods and allowing it to be used for tasks where training or evaluating multiple models would be infeasible. We apply LTAU towards estimating parametric uncertainty in atomistic force fields (LTAU-FF), demonstrating that its improved ensemble diversity produces well-calibrated confidence intervals and predicts errors that correlate strongly with the true errors for data near the training domain. Furthermore, we show that the errors predicted by LTAU-FF can be used in practical applications for detecting out-of-domain data, tuning model performance, and predicting failure during simulations. We believe that LTAU will be a valuable tool for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in atomistic force fields and is a promising method that should be further explored in other domains of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and W$X_3$ ($X$= Cl, Br, I) have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</description>
