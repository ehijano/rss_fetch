      <title>Investigation of triangularity effects on tokamak edge turbulence through multi-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses the gyro-moment (GM) approach as a multi-fidelity tool to explore the effect of triangularity on tokamak edge turbulence. Considering experimental data from an L-mode DIII-D discharge, we conduct gyrokinetic (GK) simulations with realistic plasma edge geometry parameters at $\rho=0.95$. We find that employing ten GMs effectively captures essential features of both trapped electron mode (TEM) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence. By comparing electromagnetic GK simulations with adiabatic electron GK and reduced fluid simulations, we identify the range of validity of the reduced models. We observe that TEMs drive turbulent heat transport under nominal discharge conditions, hindering accurate transport level estimates by both simplified models. However, when TEMs are absent, and turbulence is ITG-driven, an agreement across the different models is observed. Finally, a parameter scan shows that the positive triangularity scenario destabilizes the TEM, therefore, the adiabatic electron model tends to show agreement with the electromagnetic simulations in zero and negative triangularity scenarios. On the other hand, the reduced fluid simulations exhibit limited sensitivity to triangularity changes, shedding light on the importance of retaining kinetic effects to accurately model the impact of triangularity turbulence in the tokamak edge. In conclusion, our multi-fidelity study suggests that a GM hierarchy with a limited number of moments is an ideal candidate for efficiently exploring triangularity effects on micro-scale turbulence.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron-driven instabilities in relativistic plasmas of arbitrary opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that synchrotron emission from relativistic plasmas leads the electron distribution to form an anisotropic ring in momentum space, which can be unstable to both kinetic and hydrodynamic instabilities. Fundamental to these works was the assumption that the plasma was optically thin, allowing all emitted radiation to escape. Here, we examine the behavior of these instabilities as the plasma becomes more optically thick. To do this, we extend a recently-developed Fokker-Planck operator for synchrotron emission and absorption in mildly relativistic plasmas to fully relativistic plasmas. For a given set of plasma parameters, photons emitted by higher-energy electrons tend to be higher frequency, and thus more easily escape the plasma. As a result, the ratio of the photon emission rate (radiative drag) to absorption rate (radiative diffusion) for a given electron is extremely energy-dependent. Given this behavior, we determine the critical parameters that control the opacity, and show how the plasma gradually transitions to become more isotropic and stable at higher opacity.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Impact of Baffling on Divertor Performance Using SOLPS-ITER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong divertor baffling is a feature expected to have a number of advantages for core-edge integration in tokamaks, yet one which requires much more detailed and extensive study. In this work, the impacts of baffling on a hydrogenic plasma are studied in isolation, through artificial fixed-fraction impurity SOLPS-ITER simulations. These simulations are of the connected double null Super-X divertor on the MAST-U tokamak, with extreme cases of a closed and open divertor. Simulations show a divertor with a tightly baffled entrance can lead to better access to detachment on the outer targets, likely caused by reduced convection upstream. Adding tight baffling at the throat also leads to two orders of magnitude increase in neutral compression, and an order of magnitude more efficient pumping, with more peaked core density profiles. Finally, in contrast to the localised radiation of the closed divertor, the open divertor shows radiation along the entire plasma edge which moves upstream and inward into the core as detachment evolves; leading to sub-10eV temperatures in the near SOL at x-point.</description>

      <title>The separatrix operational space of next-step fusion experiments: From ASDEX Upgrade data to SPARC scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion power plants require ELM-free, detached operation to prevent divertor damage and erosion. The separatrix operational space (SepOS) is proposed as a tool for identifying access to the type-I ELM-free quasi-continuous exhaust regime. In this work, we recast the SepOS framework using simple parameters and present dedicated ASDEX Upgrade discharges to demonstrate how to interpret its results. Analyzing an extended ASDEX Upgrade database consisting of 6688 individual measurements, we show that SepOS accurately describes how the H-mode boundary varies with plasma current and magnetic field strength. We then introduce a normalized SepOS framework and LH minimum scaling and show that normalized boundaries across multiple machines are nearly identical, suggesting that the normalized SepOS can be used to translate results between different machines. The LH minimum density predicted by SepOS is found to closely match an experimentally determined multi-machine scaling, which provides a further indirect validation of SepOS across multiple devices. Finally, we demonstrate how SepOS can be used predictively, identifying a viable QCE operational point for SPARC, at a separatrix density of 4e20/m3, a separatrix temperature of 156eV and an alpha-t of 0.7 - a value solidly within the QCE operational space on ASDEX Upgrade. This demonstrates how SepOS provides a concise, intuitive method for scoping ELM-free operation on next-step devices.</description>

      <title>Design of a Thomson scattering diagnostic for the SMART tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design of a Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostic to be used on the SMall Aspect Ratio Tokamak (SMART). SMART is a spherical tokamak being commissioned in Spain that aims to explore positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) plasma scenarios at a low aspect ratio. The SMART TS diagnostic is designed to enable a wide range of electron temperature (1 eV to 1 keV) and density (0.5 - 10 $\times 10^{19} ~\rm{m^{ - 3}}$) measurements. A 2Joule laser operating at 1064 nm will be used to probe the electron temperature and density of the plasma. The laser is capable of operating in the burst mode at 1kHz, 2kHz, and 4kHz to investigate fast phenomena or at $30$ Hz to study 1 sec (or more) long discharges. The scattered light will be collected over an angular range of 60-120 degrees at 28 spatial points in the midplane covering the core region and edge plasma on both the low-field side (LFS) and the high-field side (HFS). Simulation data is used to determine the optimum location of Thomson scattering measurement points to effectively resolve the edge pedestal in the LFS and HFS regions under different triangularity conditions. Each scattering signal will be spectrally resolved on five wavelength channels of a polychromator to obtain the electron temperature measurement. We will also present a method to monitor in-situ laser alignment in the core during calibrations and plasma operations.</description>

      <title>A study of DC electrical breakdown in liquid helium through analysis of the empirical breakdown field distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results from a study on electrical breakdown in liquid helium using near-uniform-field stainless steel electrodes with a stressed area of $\sim$0.725 cm$^2$. The distribution of the breakdown field is obtained for temperatures between 1.7 K and 4.0 K, pressures between the saturated vapor pressure and 626 Torr, and with electrodes of different surface polishes. A data-based approach for determining the electrode-surface-area scaling of the breakdown field is presented. The dependence of the breakdown probability on the field strength as extracted from the breakdown field distribution data is used to show that breakdown is a surface phenomenon closely correlated with Fowler-Nordheim field emission from asperities on the cathode. We show that the results from this analysis provides an explanation for the supposed electrode gap-size effect and also allows for a determination of the breakdown-field distribution for arbitrary shaped electrodes. Most importantly, the analysis method presented in this work can be extended to other noble liquids to explore the dependencies for electrical breakdown in those media.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Hard X-ray Radiation of Two Ribbons in a Thermal-Dominated C-Class Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymmetry in hard X-ray (HXR) emission at the footpoints (FPs) of flare loops is a ubiquitous feature closely associated with nonthermal electron transport. We analyze the asymmetric HXR radiation at two flare ribbons which is thermal-dominated during a long-duration C4.4 flare that occurred on March 20, 2023, combining multi-view and multi-waveband observations from the ASO-S, SolO, and SDO spacecraft. We find that the H I Ly$\alpha$ emission captures similar features to the He II $\lambda$304 in both light curve and spatio-temporal evolution of a pair of conjugate flare ribbons. The spectra and imaging analysis of the HXR emission, detected by STIX in 4-18 keV, reveal that the two-ribbon flare radiation is thermal dominated by over 95%, and the radiation source mainly concentrates on the northern ribbon, leading to an asymmetric distribution. To understand the underlying reasons for the HXR radiation asymmetry, we extrapolate the magnetic field within the active region using the NLFFF model. For 78% of the magnetic field lines starting from the northern flare ribbon, their lengths from the loop-tops (LTs) to the northern FPs are shorter than those to the southern FPs. For 62% of the field lines, their magnetic field strengths at the southern FPs exceed those at the northern FPs. In addition, considering the larger density, $\approx1.0\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, of the low-lying flare loops (&lt; 32 Mm), we find the shorter path from the LT to the northern FP enables more electrons to reach the northern FP more easily after collisions with the surrounding plasma. Therefore, in this thermal-dominated C-class flare, the asymmetric location of the flare LT relative to its two FPs plays a dominant role in the HXR radiation asymmetry, while such asymmetry is also slightly influenced by the magnetic mirror effect resulting in larger HXR radiation at the FPs with weaker magnetic strength.</description>

      <title>Comparing growth of titania and carbonaceous dusty nanoparticles in weakly magnetised capacitively coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study compares the growth cycles and spatial distribution of dust cloud for titania and carbonaceous dusty nanoparticles in capacitively coupled radiofrequency plasmas, with and without the presence of a weak magnetic field of approximately 500 Gauss. Findings on cycle time, growth rate, and spatial distribution of dust cloud are discussed. The growth of nanoparticles in these plasmas is cyclic, with particles reaching their maximum size and subsequently moving out of the plasma, followed by the generation of a new particle growth cycle. The presence of the magnetic field speeds up the growth cycle in both plasma. The magnetic field also makes the spatial distribution of the two dust cloud different from each other. Langmuir probe measurement of the background plasma parameters such as electron temperature and floating potential reveal radial variations in floating potential but not electron temperature. Furthermore, the magnetic field changes the radial variation of floating potential. These measurements, however, are not sufficient to explain why the two dust clouds appear differently. It is possible that the differences occur due to a gradient in the radial distribution of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>3D MHD modelling of plasmoid drift following massive material injection in a tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms of plasmoid drift following massive material injection are studied via 3D non-linear MHD modelling with the JOREK code, using a transient neutral source deposited on the low field side midplane of a JET H-mode plasma to clarify basic processes and compare with existing theory. The simulations confirm the important role of the propagation of shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) packets from both ends of the plasmoid ("SAW braking") and the development of external resistive currents along magnetic field lines ("P\'egouri\'e braking") in limiting charge separation and thus the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ plasmoid drift, where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The drift velocity is found to be limited by the SAW braking on the few microseconds timescale for cases with relatively small source amplitude while the P\'egouri\'e braking is shown to set in earlier with larger toroidal extent of the source, both in good agreement with existing theory. The simulations also identify the key role of the size of the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region on plasmoid drift and show that the saturated velocity caused by dominant SAW braking agrees well with theory when considering an effective pressure within the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region. The existence of SAWs in the simulations is demonstrated and the 3D picture of plasmoid drift is also discussed.</description>
