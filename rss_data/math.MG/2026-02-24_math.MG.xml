      <title>One polytope fits all: Characterization of the Euclidean ball via simultaneous intrinsic volume approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic best approximation of a smooth, strictly convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by inscribed polytopes with a restricted number of vertices under the intrinsic volume difference. We prove rigidity phenomena in both the deterministic and probabilistic settings. In the deterministic model of inscribed approximation, we show that if a single sequence of polytopes is asymptotically best for the volume and mean width difference simultaneously, then $K$ must be a Euclidean ball. In particular, the Euclidean ball is the unique $C_+^2$ convex body for which one sequence of polytopes can approximate all intrinsic volumes simultaneously at the optimal asymptotic rate.
  In the probabilistic model, we prove a stronger statement: if a single sampling density on $\partial K$ yields random inscribed polytopes that are asymptotically optimal (in expectation) for any two distinct intrinsic volume deviations, then $K$ must be a Euclidean ball. Moreover, using polarity, we establish dual versions of this rigidity theorem for polytopes circumscribed about $K$ (with a restricted number of facets) in the volume and mean width cases, again in both deterministic and probabilistic frameworks. The proofs use tools from asymptotic quantization theory together with the curvature-based optimal vertex distributions. These results resolve an open question posed by Besau, Hoehner and Kur ({\it IMRN}, 2021).</description>

      <title>Stability of optimal transport on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative stability of Kantorovich potentials on metric measure spaces with lower Ricci curvature bound, thereby confirming a recent conjecture of Kitagawa, Letrouit and M\'erigot. Our proof, which employs the heat kernel-regularized $c$-transform, does not rely on linear structure or sectional curvature bounds. As a corollary, we get a quantitative stability of optimal transport maps on Alexandrov spaces with lower curvature bound.</description>

      <title>P\'al's isominwidth inequality for ball convex bodies in planes of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P\'al's classical isominwidth inequality states that the regular triangle has minimal area among plane convex bodies of minimal width $w$. A similar result is the Blaschke--Lebesgue inequality that states that Reuleaux triangles minimize the area among bodies of constant width $w$ in the plane. In this paper, we connect these two problems by solving the isominwidth problem for $r$-ball convex bodies in the Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical planes.</description>

      <title>Distance Equilibrium Measures and Curvature in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space. We consider the behavior of probability measures $\mu$ with the property that $$ \int_{X} d(x, y) d\mu(y) \qquad \mbox{is independent of}~x \in X.$$ It appears that such measures, when they exist, encode a `curvature-type' quantity. We investigate this in the special case where $X$ is a closed, convex curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $d = \| \cdot \|_2$ is the Euclidean distance: even a single point with small curvature implies non-existence of such a measure. Conversely, such a measure $\mu$ exists for all curves whose curvature is sufficiently close to constant. Curvature is usually defined by second derivatives; this one is defined via an integral equation which makes sense in much rougher spaces. Connections to curvature on graphs, the Gross-Stadje Theorem and magnitude are discussed.</description>

      <title>Maximal Equidistant Spacings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call a family $\{Y_1,\dots,Y_I\}$ in Euclidean space an equidistance spacing if $\|y_i - y_j\| = 1$ whenever $y_i \in Y_i, y_j \in Y_j$ and $i \neq j$. In other words, choosing a representative from each set produces a complete distance graph (i.e. equilateral set). We say such a spacing is maximal if each $Y_i$ is maximal under inclusion. In this work we characterize maximal equidistant spacings in $\mathbb R^n$. For each equidistant spacing there is an associated center (a point in $\mathbb R^n$) and radius (a non-negative scalar) so that the centers form an orthocentric system. Using arguments from classical geometry we find that the moduli space of maximal equidistant spacings is described in terms of the movement of its center and radii. Using tools from geometric combinatorics, we develop a discrete combinatorial object called the signature. Our classification theorem shows that maximal equidistant spacings are isometric if and only if they have the same signature. We also construct all maximal equidistant spacings in $\mathbb R^1,\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb R^3$, outline a procedure for constructing all maximal equidistant spacings in $\mathbb R^n$, and give an algorithm for checking if a locus of points is equidistantly spaced that is linear in the number of points, an improvement over the naive direct quadratic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Geometric Large-Deviation-Type Principles for Mixed Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the large deviation principle for mixed measures associated with a class of $\log$-concave probability measures whose densities depend on the gauge function of a convex body. For convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we prove a geometric large-deviation-type asymptotic for first-order mixed measures, where the decay under dilation is governed by a natural inradius associated with the measure. In the planar case, we derive an explicit integral representation for second-order mixed measures and obtain a corresponding asymptotic. As an application, we prove a comparison theorem showing that asymptotic dominance under dilation forces inclusion between convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Snub Polyhedra in Ordinary Space, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skeletal polyhedra are discrete connected structures consisting of finite (planar or skew) or infinite (linear, planar, or spatial) polygons as faces, with two faces on each edge and a circular vertex figure at each vertex. The present paper describes the blueprint for the snub construction and shows that it can be applied to both regular and chiral skeletal polyhedra in ordinary space. The resulting skeletal snub polyhedra are vertex-transitive and highly locally symmetric. Their properties - from a combinatorial, topological, and geometric perspective - are described and illustrated on some particularly interesting examples. We examine when the construction yields uniform skeletal polyhedra and discuss the completeness of our list of generated structures.</description>

      <title>$L_1$-distortion of Earth Mover Distances and Transportation Cost Spaces on High Dimensional Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the distortion of any embedding into $L_1$ of the transportation cost space or earth mover distance over a $d$-dimensional grid $\{1,\dots m\}^d$ is $\Omega(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices and the implicit constant is universal (in particular, independent of dimension). This lower bound matches the universal upper bound $O(\log N)$ holding for any $N$-point metric space. Our proof relies on a new Sobolev inequality for real-valued functions on the grid, based on random measures supported on dyadic cubes.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of spherical $5$- and $7$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an explicit and implementable framework for constructing spherical designs by lifting point sets from tight fusion frames. By combining existing ingredients, we obtain, in every dimension, explicit spherical $5$-designs with $|X|=\mathcal{O}(d^3)$. As a core component of the method, we give an explicit construction of simplex $3$-designs realized as orbits of the symmetric group. Using these simplex designs as input, we further construct spherical $7$-designs in arbitrary even dimensions; more precisely, for every even integer $d\ge 6$ we obtain spherical $7$-designs in dimension $d$, and if $\frac{d}{2}-1$ is a prime power then the number of points is $\mathcal{O}(d^6)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ and $L$ be two convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq 3$, with $L\subset \text{int}\, K$. In this paper we prove the following result: if every two parallel chords of $K$, supporting $L$ have the same length, then $K$ and $L$ are homothetic and concentric ellipsoids. We also prove a similar theorem when instead of parallel chords we consider concurrent chords. We may also replace, in both theorems, supporting chords of $L$ by supporting sections of constant width. In the last section we also prove similar theorems where we consider projections instead of sections.</description>

Abstract: Let us consider the set $\Omega (\triangle ABC)$ of all tetrahedra $ABCD$ with a given non-degenerate base $ABC$ in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $D$ lying outside the plane $ABC$. Let us denote by $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ the set $\left\{\Bigl(\cos \overline{\alpha},\cos \overline{\beta},\cos \overline{\gamma} \Bigr)\in \mathbb{R}^3\,|\, ABCD \in \Omega (\triangle ABC)\right\}$, where $\overline{\alpha}=\angle BDC$, $\overline{\beta}=\angle ADC$, and $\overline{\gamma}=\angle ADB$. The paper is devoted to the problem of determining of the closure of $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its boundary.</description>

      <title>Characterization of John domains via weak tangents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize simply connected John domains in the plane with the aid of weak tangents of the boundary. Specifically, we prove that a bounded simply connected domain $D$ is a John domain if and only if, for every weak tangent $Y$ of $\partial D$, every connected component of the complement of $Y$ that ``originates" from $D$ is a John domain, not necessarily with uniform constants. Our main theorem improves a result of Kinneberg (arXiv:1507.04698), who obtains a necessary condition for a John domain in terms of weak tangents but not a sufficient one. We also establish several properties of weak tangents of John domains.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell bounds via parallel coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any log-concave random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with mean zero and identity covariance, $$ \mathbb{E} (|X| - \sqrt{n})^2 \leq C $$ where $C &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Thus, most of the mass of the random vector $X$ is concentrated in a thin spherical shell, whose width is only $C / \sqrt{n}$ times its radius. This confirms the thin-shell conjecture in high dimensional convex geometry. Our method relies on the construction of a certain coupling between log-affine perturbations of the law of $X$ related to Eldan's stochastic localization and to the theory of non-linear filtering. Another ingredient is a recent breakthrough technique by Guan that was previously used in our proof of Bourgain's slicing conjecture, which is known to be implied by the thin-shell conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of double base expansions and binary shifts with a hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two real bases $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number \[ \pi_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. \] Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</description>
