      <title>On the characterization of the Dirichlet and Fu\v{c}\'ik spectra for the one-dimensional asymmetric p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the Dirichlet spectrum $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of the asymmetric $p$-Laplace operator $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on an interval $(0,L)$ where
  \[ \Delta^{a,b}_p u:= \left(a^{p}[(u')^{+}]^{p-1}-b^{p}[(u')^{-}]^{p-1}\right)'. \] We characterize completely the set $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ and the respective eigenfunctions in terms of the corresponding ones for the classical one-dimensional $p$-Laplace operator and establish that only the eigenfunctions associated to the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ have definite sign and, furthermore, its eigenspace is formed precisely by two non-collinear half-lines in $C^1[0,L]$ if and only if $a \neq b$. Our approach also allows to characterize the Fu\v c\'ik spectrum $\Sigma^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ from a disjoint enumerate union of hyperboles closely related to the classical counterpart and corresponding solutions. All results are novelty even for $p = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use B\'{e}zout's theorem and Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem to analyze the level sets of the extrema of the spectral band functions of discrete periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^2$.

      <description>arXiv:2501.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a second order difference equation with operator-valued coefficients. More precisely, we study either compact or trace class perturbations of the discrete Laplacian in the Hilbert space of bi-infinite square-summable sequence with entries in a fixed Hilbert space. We discuss its continuous and discrete spectrum, as well as properties of the associated scattering matrix.</description>

      <title>An analysis of non-selfadjoint first-order differential operators with non-local point interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectra of non-selfadjoint first-order operators on the interval with non-local point interactions, formally given by ${i\partial_x+V+k\langle \delta,\cdot\rangle}$. We give precise estimates on the location of the eigenvalues on the complex plane and prove that the root vectors of these operators form Riesz bases of $L^2(0,2\pi)$. Under the additional assumption that the operator is maximally dissipative, we prove that it can have at most one real eigenvalue, and given any $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, we explicitly construct the unique operator realization such that $\lambda$ is in its spectrum. We also investigate the time-evolution generated by these maximally dissipative operators.</description>

      <title>Growth estimates for Nevanlinna matrices of order larger than one half</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objects of study are two-dimensional canonical systems that arise from indeterminate Hamburger moment problems and associated half-line Jacobi operators in limit circle case. The monodromy matrix of such a system coincides, up to a permutation of its entries, with the Nevanlinna matrix of the associated moment problem. Its growth relates to the density of eigenvalues of self-adjoint realisations of the system and the Jacobi operator, respectively. The order of the Nevanlinna matrix is known to be at most 1. In the case of "large" order, meaning order greater than one half, determining the growth of the monodromy matrix is known to be harder than for "small" order, i.e., order less than one half. As our main result, we establish an explicit new lower bound for data featuring a certain kind of monotonicity, which correctly describes the growth in the case of large order. Moreover, we compute the order of the Nevanlinna matrix of a limit circle Jacobi matrix with two-term power asymptotics in a critical case.</description>

      <title>The density conjecture for Juddian points for the quantum Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study doubly degenerate (Juddian) eigenvalues for the Quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, a simple model of the interaction between a two-level atom and a single quantized mode of light. We prove a strong form of the density conjecture of Kimoto, Reyes-Bustos, and Wakayama, showing that any fixed value of the splitting between the two atomic levels, there is a dense set of coupling strengths for which the corresponding Rabi Hamiltonian admits Juddian eigenvalues. We also construct infinitely many sets of parameters for which the Rabi Hamiltonian admits two distinct Juddian eigenvalues. The fine structure of the zeros of classical Laguerre polynomials plays a key role in our methods.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on concentration through Borel transforms and quantitative singularity of spectral measures near the arithmetic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop tools to study arithmetically induced singular continuous spectrum in the neighborhood of the arithmetic transition in the hyperbolic regime. This leads to first transition-capturing upper bounds on packing and multifractal dimensions of spectral measures. We achieve it through the proof of partial localization of generalized eigenfunctions, another first result of its kind in the singular continuous regime. The proof is based also on a general criterion for lower bounds on concentrations of Borel measures as a corollary of boundary behavior of their Borel-type transforms, that may be of wider use and independent interest.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to WKB-methods: The eigenvalue problem for a single well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the eigenvalue problem of the one-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger equation for smooth single well potentials. In particular, we provide a new interpretation of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula. A novel aspect of our results, which are based on recent work of the authors on the turning point problem based upon dynamical systems methods, is that we cover all eigenvalues $E\in [0,\mathcal O(1)]$ and show that the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantitization formula approximates all of these eigenvalues (in a sense that is made precise). At the same time, we provide rigorous smoothness statements of the eigenvalues as functions of $\epsilon$. We find that whereas the small eigenvalues $E=\mathcal O(\epsilon)$ are smooth functions of $\epsilon$, the large ones $E=\mathcal O(1)$ are smooth functions of $n\epsilon \in[c_1,c_2],\,0&lt;c_1&lt;c_2&lt;\infty$, and $0\le \epsilon^{1/3}\ll 1$; here $n\in \mathbb N_0$ is the index of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Inverse Stefan problems of determining the time-dependent source coefficient and heat flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the Inverse Stefan problem, specifically focusing on determining the time-dependent source coefficient in the parabolic heat equation governing heat transfer in a semi-infinite rod. The problem entails the intricate task of uncovering both temperature- and time-dependent coefficients of the source while accommodating Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Through a comprehensive mathematical model and rigorous theoretical analysis, our study aims to provide a robust methodology for accurately determining the source coefficient from observed temperature and heat flux data in problems with different cases of the source functions. Importantly, we establish the existence and uniqueness, and estimate the continuous dependence of a weak solution upon the given data for some inverse problems, offering a foundational understanding of its solvability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to provide simple and practical algorithms in higher-order Fourier analysis which are based on spectral decompositions of operators. We propose a general framework for such algorithms and provide a detailed analysis of the quadratic case. Our results reveal new spectral aspects of the theory underlying higher-order Fourier analysis. Along these lines, we prove new inverse and regularity theorems for the Gowers norms based on higher-order character decompositions. Using these results, we prove a spectral inverse theorem and a spectral regularity theorem in quadratic Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Dual Cheeger Constants, Signless 1-Laplacians and Maxcut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.00489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first nontrivial lower bound of the worst-case approximation ratio for the maxcut problem was achieved via the dual Cheeger problem, whose optimal value is referred to the dual Cheeger constant $h^+$, and later improved through its modification $\widehat{h}^+$. However, the dual Cheeger problem and its modification themselves are relatively unexplored, especially lack of effective approximate algorithms. To this end, we first derive equivalent spectral formulations of $h^+$ and $\widehat{h}^+$ within the framework of the nonlinear spectral theory of signless 1-Laplacian, present their interactions with the Laplacian matrix and 1-Laplacian, and then use them to develop an inverse power algorithm that leverages the local linearity of the objective functions involved. We prove that the inverse power algorithm monotonically converges to a ternary-valued eigenvector, and provide the approximate values of $h^+$ and $\widehat{h}^+$ on G-set for the first time. The recursive spectral cut algorithm for the maxcut problem can be enhanced by integrating into the inverse power algorithms, leading to significantly improved approximate values on G-set. Finally, we show that the lower bound of the worst-case approximation ratio for the maxcut problem within the recursive spectral cut framework can not be improved beyond $0.769$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a new class of band matrices is considered where the entries of each non-zero band form a sequence with two limit points. The compact perturbation technique is used to study the spectrum over the $\ell_{p}, (1&lt;p&lt;\infty)$ sequence space. Several spectral subdivisions such as fine spectrum, discrete spectrum, essential spectrum, etc. are obtained. In addition, a few sufficient conditions on the absence of point spectrum over the essential spectrum are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of the work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend the ideas of Rohleder to a new proof of Friedlander's inequality for any bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <title>New bounds of extended energy of a graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended adjacency matrix of a graph with $n$ vertices is a real symmetric matrix of order $n\times n$ whose $(i,j)$-th entry is the average of the ratio of the degree of the vertex $i$ to that of the vertex $j$ and its reciprocal when $i,j$ are adjacent and zero otherwise. The aggregate of absolute eigenvalues of the extended adjacency matrix is termed the extended energy.
  In this paper, the concept of extended vertex energy is introduced, and some bounds of extended vertex energy are obtained. From there, we establish some new upper bounds of the extended energy of a graph involving order, size, largest, and smallest degree. We show that those are improvements of some existing bounds. Through direct manipulation, we have also established some more upper and lower bounds of extended energy, which are either better or incomparable with the existing bounds. Finally, some improved bounds of Nordhaus-Gaddum-type are found.</description>

      <title>Quantitative multiscale operator-type approximations for asymptotically degenerating spectral problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an abstract family of asymptotically degenerating variational problems. Those are natural generalisations of families of problems emerging upon application of a rescaled Floquet-Bloch-Gelfand transform to resolvent problems for high-contrast elliptic PDEs with highly oscillatory periodic coefficients. An asymptotic analysis of these models leads us to a hierarchy of approximation results with uniform operator-type error estimates under various assumptions, satisfied by specific examples. We provide approximations for the resolvents in terms of a certain `bivariate' operator which appears an abstract generalisation of the two-scale limit operators for highly oscillatory high-contrast PDEs. The resulting approximating self-adjoint operator, providing tight operator error estimates, is the bivariate operator sandwiched by a connecting operator which for a broad class of periodic problems specialises to a new two-scale version of the classical Whittaker-Shannon interpolation. An explicit description of the limit spectrum in the abstract setting is provided, and new tight error estimates on the distance between the original and limit spectra are established. Our generic approach allows us to readily consider a wide class of asymptotically degenerating problems including but also going beyond high-contrast highly oscillatory PDEs. The obtained results are illustrated by various examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a qualitative homogenisation and spectral theory for elliptic systems of partial differential equations in divergence form with highly contrasting (i.e., non uniformly elliptic) random coefficients. The focus of the paper is on the behaviour of the spectrum as the heterogeneity parameter tends to zero; in particular, we show that in general one doesn't have Hausdorff convergence of spectra. The theoretical analysis is complemented by several explicit examples, showcasing the wider range of applications and physical effects of systems with random coefficients, when compared with systems with periodic coefficients or with scalar operators (both random and periodic).</description>

Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>
