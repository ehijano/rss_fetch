      <title>Asset Pricing in Pre-trained Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative Transformer model, Single-directional representative from Transformer (SERT), for US large capital stock pricing. It also innovatively applies the pre-trained Transformer models under the stock pricing and factor investment context. They are compared with standard Transformer models and encoder-only Transformer models in three periods covering the entire COVID-19 pandemic to examine the model adaptivity and suitability during the extreme market fluctuations. Namely, pre-COVID-19 period (mild up-trend), COVID-19 period (sharp up-trend with deep down shock) and 1-year post-COVID-19 (high fluctuation sideways movement). The best proposed SERT model achieves the highest out-of-sample R2, 11.2% and 10.91% respectively, when extreme market fluctuation takes place followed by pre-trained Transformer models (10.38% and 9.15%). Their Trend-following-based strategy wise performance also proves their excellent capability for hedging downside risks during market shocks. The proposed SERT model achieves a Sortino ratio 47% higher than the buy-and-hold benchmark in the equal-weighted portfolio and 28% higher in the value-weighted portfolio when the pandemic period is attended. It proves that Transformer models have a great capability to capture patterns of temporal sparsity data in the asset pricing factor model, especially with considerable volatilities. We also find the softmax signal filter as the common configuration of Transformer models in alternative contexts, which only eliminates differences between models, but does not improve strategy-wise performance, while increasing attention heads improve the model performance insignificantly and applying the 'layer norm first' method do not boost the model performance in our case.</description>

      <title>q-Learning in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning for reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation introduced by Wang et al. (2020). As the conventional (big) Q-function collapses in continuous time, we consider its first-order approximation and coin the term ``(little) q-function". This function is related to the instantaneous advantage rate function as well as the Hamiltonian. We develop a ``q-learning" theory around the q-function that is independent of time discretization. Given a stochastic policy, we jointly characterize the associated q-function and value function by martingale conditions of certain stochastic processes, in both on-policy and off-policy settings. We then apply the theory to devise different actor-critic algorithms for solving underlying RL problems, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the q-function can be computed explicitly. One of our algorithms interprets the well-known Q-learning algorithm SARSA, and another recovers a policy gradient (PG) based continuous-time algorithm proposed in Jia and Zhou (2022b). Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to compare the performance of our algorithms with those of PG-based algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022b) and time-discretized conventional Q-learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Models in Asset Pricing: An Empirical Study on Large-Cap US Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, MLP models with dynamic structure are applied to factor models for asset pricing tasks. Concretely, the MLP pyramid model structure was employed on firm-characteristic-sorted portfolio factors for modelling the large-capital US stocks. It was further developed as a practicable factor investing strategy based on the predictions. The main findings in this chapter were evaluated from two angles: model performance and investing performance, which were compared from the periods with and without COVID-19. The empirical results indicated that with the restrictions of the data size, the MLP models no longer perform "deeper, better", while the proposed MLP models with two and three hidden layers have higher flexibility to model the factors in this case. This study also verified the idea of previous works that MLP models for factor investing have more meaning in the downside risk control than in pursuing the absolute annual returns.</description>
