      <title>Stochastic Geometry for Modeling and Analysis of Sensing and Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising technologies for next-generation wireless networks is integrated communication and sensing (ISAC). It is considered a key enabler for applications that require both enhanced communication and accurate sensing capabilities. Examples of such applications include smart environments, augmented and virtual reality, or the internet of things, where the capabilities of intelligent sensing and broadband communications are vital. Therefore, ISAC has attracted the research interest of both academia and industry, and many investigations have been carried out over the past decade. The articles in the literature include system models, performance evaluation, and optimization studies of several ISAC alternative designs. Stochastic geometry is the study and analysis of random spatial patterns, and as such, stochastic geometry tools have been considered for the performance evaluation of wireless networks with different types of nodes. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of current research progress in performance evaluation of ISAC systems using stochastic geometry tools. The survey covers terrestrial, aerial, and vehicular networks, where the random spatial location of the corresponding network elements and propagation scatterers and/or blockages is treated with various point processes. The paper starts with a short tutorial on ISAC technology, stochastic geometry tools, and metrics used in performance evaluation of communication and sensing. Then, the technical components of the system models utilized in the surveyed papers are discussed. Subsequently, we present the key results of the literature in all types of networks using three levels of integration: sensing-assisted communication, communication-assisted sensing, and joint sensing and communication. Finally, future research challenges and promising directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>T-Parameters Based Modeling for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: Tractable and Physically Consistent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a physically consistent model for stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) using multiport network theory and transfer scattering parameters (T-parameters). Unlike the scattering parameters (S-parameters) model, which is highly complex and non-tractable due to its nested nature and excessive number of matrix inversions, the developed T-parameters model is less complex and more tractable due to its explicit and compact nature. This work further derives the constraints of T-parameters for a lossless reciprocal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). A gradient descent algorithm (GDA) is proposed to maximize the sum rate in SIM-aided multiuser scenarios, and the results show that accounting for mutual coupling and feedback between consecutive layers can improve the sum rate. In addition, increasing the number of SIM layers with a fixed total number of elements degrades the sum rate when our exact and simplified channel models are used, unlike the simplified channel model with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction coefficients which improves the sum rate.</description>

      <title>Digital resampling using Farrow structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Farrow filters allow to develop universal oversamplers for fractional delay correction and sampling rate conversion. The use of cubic Lagrangian interpolation in Farrow filter does not allow to provide processing bandwidth more than 0.4 of sampling frequency, and also does not guarantee smoothness of impulse response of the interpolator. In this paper, we propose Farrow filter structures based on 3rd, 5th and 7th order Hermite splines using a high order differentiator. The proposed filters increase the processing bandwidth up to 0.8 of sampling frequency by increasing the order of the polynomial with additional constraints on the continuity of the derivatives at the interpolation nodes.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Uncertainty Quantification for Fast NFC Tag Identification using RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near Field Communication (NFC) is widely used in security applications such as door access systems and ID cards. However, clone attacks can replicate digital information, enabling unauthorized access. RF fingerprinting offers a robust defense by extracting unique physical-layer features from NFC cards that cannot be cloned. While RF fingerprinting has been extensively applied to Internet of Things (IoT) device authentication, NFC tags present distinct characteristics that require specialized approaches. This paper focuses on RF fingerprinting for the ISO15693 NFC tag, which is a widely used international standard, by leveraging multi-channel, multi-rate data sampling to enhance accuracy. Deep learning and Random Forest models are employed to identify NFC tags, while uncertainty quantification, particularly Conformal Prediction, accelerates the identification process with high confidence and precision. A software-defined radio (SDR) testbed is developed to transmit customized commands and collect multi-channel multi-rate NFC signals. The multi-channel multi-rate NFC signals are progressively collected to ensure fast and accurate identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves high accuracy by adaptively utilizing the optimal combination of NFC signals. The developed solution is model-agnostic which can be utilized for any machine learning-based NFC tag identification.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Joint Sensing and Communications via Fractionally Constrained Fractional Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an uplink dual-functional sensing and communication system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), whose reflection pattern is optimally configured to trade-off sensing and communication functionalities. Specifically, the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) for estimating the azimuth angle of a sensing user is minimized while ensuring the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints for communication users. We show that this problem can be formulated as a novel fractionally constrained fractional programming (FCFP) problem. To deal with this highly nontrivial problem, we extend a quadratic transform technique, originally proposed to handle optimization problems containing ratio structures only in objectives, to the scenario where the constraints also contain ratio structures. First, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is known. Using the quadratic transform, the FCFP problem is turned into a sequence of subproblems that are convex except for the constant-modulus constraints which can be tackled using a penalty-based method. To further reduce the computational complexity, we leverage the constant-modulus conditions and propose a novel linear transform. This new transform enables the FCFP problem to be turned into a sequence of linear programming (LP) subproblems, which can be solved with linear complexity in the dimension of reflecting elements. Then, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is unknown. A modified BCRLB is used to make the problem more tractable, and the proposed quadratic transform-based algorithm is used to solve the problem. Finally, numerical results unveil nontrivial and effective reflection patterns that the RIS can be configured to generate to facilitate both functionalities.</description>

      <title>Edge-Fog Computing-Enabled EEG Data Compression via Asymmetrical Variational Discrete Cosine Transform Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large volume of electroencephalograph (EEG) data produced by brain-computer interface (BCI) systems presents challenges for rapid transmission over bandwidth-limited channels in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression.</description>

      <title>Target Sensing With Off-grid Sparse Bayesian Learning for AFDM-ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed multi-chirp waveform, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), is regarded as a prospective candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) due to its robust performance in high-mobility scenarios and full diversity achievement in doubly dispersive channels. However, the insufficient Doppler resolution caused by limited transmission duration can reduce the accuracy of parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a new off-grid target parameter estimation scheme to jointly estimate the range and velocity of the targets for AFDM-ISAC system, where the off-grid Doppler components are incorporated to enhance estimation accuracy. Specifically, we form the sensing model as an off-grid sparse signal recovery problem relying on the virtual delay and Doppler grids defined in the discrete affine Fourier (DAF) domain, where the off-grid components are regarded as hyper-parameters for estimation. We also employ the expectation-maximization (EM) technique via a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework to update hyper-parameters iteratively. Simulation results indicate that our proposed off-grid algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in sensing performance and is highly robust to the AFDM-ISAC high-mobility scenario.</description>

      <title>A New Interpretation of the Time-Interleaved ADC Mismatch Problem: A Tracking-Based Hybrid Calibration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs) achieve high sampling rates by interleaving multiple sub-ADCs in parallel. Mismatch errors between the sub-ADCs, however, can significantly degrade the signal quality, which is a main performance bottleneck. This paper presents a hybrid calibration approach by interpreting the mismatch problem as a tracking problem, and uses the extended Kalman filter for online estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. After estimation, the desired signal is reconstructed using a truncated fractional delay filter and a high-pass filter. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms the existing hybrid calibration method in both mismatch estimation and compensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G radio access architecture is envisioned to contain a network of short-range in-X subnetworks with enhanced capabilities to provide efficient and reliable wireless connectivity. Short-range communications in industrial environments are actively researched at the so-called mid-bands or FR3, e.g., in the EU SNS JU 6G-SHINE project. In this paper, we analyze omni-directional radio channel measurements at 10--12 GHz frequency band to estimate large-scale channel characteristics including power-delay profile, delay spread, K-factor, and pathloss for 254 radio links measured in the Industrial Production Lab at Aalborg University, Denmark. Moreover, we perform a comparison of estimated parameters with those of the 3GPP Indoor Factory channel model.</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Maximization for Pinching Antenna-assisted NOMA Systems with Multiple Dielectric Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation design for a pinching antenna (PA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system featuring multiple dielectric waveguides. To enhance model accuracy, we propose a novel frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric waveguides in PA-assisted systems. By jointly optimizing the precoder vector and the PA placement, we aim to maximize the system's sum-rate while accounting for the power attenuation across dielectric waveguides. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To effectively address the problem at hand, we introduce an alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted system not only significantly outperforms the conventional system but also surpasses a naive PA-assisted system that disregards power attenuation. The performance gain compared to the naive PA-assisted system becomes more pronounced at high carrier frequencies, emphasizing the importance of considering power attenuation in system design.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Uplink Sensing in Millimeter-Wave ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks (PMNs), integrating ubiquitous sensing capabilities into mobile networks, represent an important application of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. In this paper, we propose a practical framework for uplink sensing of angle-of-arrival (AoA), Doppler, and delay in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, which addresses challenges posed by clock asynchrony and hybrid arrays, while being compatible with existing communication protocols. We first introduce a beam scanning method and a corresponding AoA estimation algorithm, which utilizes frequency smoothing to effectively estimate AoAs for both static and dynamic paths. We then propose several methods for constructing a ``clean'' reference signal, which is subsequently used to cancel the effect caused by the clock asynchrony. We further develop a signal ratio-based joint AoA-Doppler-delay estimator and propose an AoA-based 2D-FFT-MUSIC (AB2FM) algorithm that applies 2D-FFT operations on the signal subspace, which accelerates the computation process with low complexity. Our proposed framework can estimate parameters in pairs, removing the complicated parameter association process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and demonstrate its robustness in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</description>

      <title>An LiGME Regularizer of Designated Isolated Minimizers -- An Application to Discrete-Valued Signal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a regularized least squares estimation of discrete-valued signals, we propose an LiGME regularizer, as a nonconvex regularizer, of designated isolated minimizers. The proposed regularizer is designed as a Generalized Moreau Enhancement (GME) of the so-called SOAV convex regularizer. Every candidate vector in the discrete-valued set is aimed to be assigned to an isolated local minimizer of the proposed regularizer while the overall convexity of the regularized least squares model is maintained. Moreover, a global minimizer of the proposed model can be approximated iteratively by using a variant of cLiGME algorithm. To enhance the accuracy of the proposed estimation, we also propose a pair of simple modifications, called respectively an iterative reweighting and a generalized superiorization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms in a scenario of MIMO signal detection.</description>

      <title>Optimal Privacy-Preserving Distributed Median Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed median consensus has emerged as a critical paradigm in multi-agent systems due to the inherent robustness of the median against outliers and anomalies in measurement. Despite the sensitivity of the data involved, the development of privacy-preserving mechanisms for median consensus remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first rigorous analysis of privacy in distributed median consensus, focusing on an $L_1$-norm minimization framework. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which exact consensus and perfect privacy-defined as zero information leakage-can be achieved simultaneously. Our information-theoretic analysis provides provable guarantees against passive and eavesdropping adversaries, ensuring that private data remain concealed. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical feasibility of achieving both accuracy and privacy in distributed median consensus.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Wigner Distribution in the Linear Canonical Transform Domain: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper devotes to combine the chirp basis function transformation and symplectic coordinates transformation to yield a novel Wigner distribution (WD) associated with the linear canonical transform (LCT), named as the symplectic WD in the LCT domain (SWDL). It incorporates the merits of the symplectic WD (SWD) and the WD in the LCT domain (WDL), achieving stronger capability in the linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal frequency rate feature extraction while maintaining the same level of computational complexity. Some essential properties of the SWDL are derived, including marginal distributions, energy conservations, unique reconstruction, Moyal formula, complex conjugate symmetry, time reversal symmetry, scaling property, time translation property, frequency modulation property, and time translation and frequency modulation property. Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the SWDL are formulated, giving rise to three kinds of lower bounds attainable respectively by Gaussian enveloped complex exponential signal, Gaussian signal and Gaussian enveloped chirp signal. The optimal symplectic matrices corresponding to the highest time-frequency resolution are generated by solving the lower bound optimization (minimization) problem. The time-frequency resolution of the SWDL is compared with those of the SWD and WDL to demonstrate its superiority in LFM signals time-frequency energy concentration. A synthesis example is also carried out to verify the feasibility and reliability of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning-Based Sparse Recovery for Device Activity Detection in Grant-Free Random Access Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Enhancing Resilience to Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive MIMO is considered a key enabler to support massive machine-type communication (mMTC). While massive access schemes have been extensively analyzed for co-located massive MIMO arrays, this paper explores activity detection in grant-free random access for mMTC within the context of cell-free massive MIMO systems, employing distributed antenna arrays. This sparse support recovery of device activity status is performed by a finite cluster of access points (APs) from a large number of geographically distributed APs collaborating to serve a larger number of devices. Active devices transmit non-orthogonal pilot sequences to APs, which forward the received signals to a central processing unit (CPU) for collaborative activity detection. This paper proposes a simple and efficient data-driven algorithm tailored for device activity detection, implemented centrally at the CPU. Furthermore, the study assesses the algorithm's robustness to input perturbations and examines the effects of adopting fixed-point representation on its performance.</description>

      <title>CoDiPhy: A General Framework for Applying Denoising Diffusion Models to the Physical Layer of Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models, including denoising diffusion models (DM), are gaining attention in wireless applications due to their ability to learn complex data distributions. In this paper, we propose CoDiPhy, a novel framework that leverages conditional denoising diffusion models to address a wide range of wireless physical layer problems. A key challenge of using DM is the need to assume or approximate Gaussian signal models. CoDiPhy addresses this by incorporating a conditional encoder as a guidance mechanism, mapping problem observations to a latent space and removing the Gaussian constraint. By combining conditional encoding, time embedding layers, and a U-Net-based main neural network, CoDiPhy introduces a noise prediction neural network, replacing the conventional approach used in DM. This adaptation enables CoDiPhy to serve as an effective solution for a wide range of detection, estimation, and predistortion tasks. We demonstrate CoDiPhy's adaptability through two case studies: an OFDM receiver for detection and phase noise compensation for estimation. In both cases, CoDiPhy outperforms conventional methods by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Liquid Lens-Based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a tunable liquid convex lens-assisted imaging receiver for indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. In contrast to existing MIMO VLC receivers that rely on fixed optical lenses, the proposed receiver leverages the additional degrees of freedom offered by liquid lenses via adjusting both focal length and orientation angles of the lens. This capability facilitates the mitigation of spatial correlation between the channel gains, thereby enhancing the overall signal quality and leading to improved bit-error rate (BER) performance. We present an accurate channel model for the liquid lens-assisted VLC system by using three-dimensional geometry and geometric optics. To achieve optimal performance under practical conditions such as random receiver orientation and user mobility, optimization of both focal length and orientation angles of the lens are required. To this end, driven by the fact that channel models are mathematically complex, we present two optimization schemes including a blockwise machine learning (ML) architecture that includes convolution layers to extract spatial features from the received signal, long-short term memory layers to predict the user position and orientation, and fully connected layers to estimate the optimal lens parameters. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance of each scheme with conventional receivers. Results show that a significant BER improvement is achieved when liquid lenses and presented ML-based optimization approaches are used. Specifically, the BER can be improved from $6\times 10^{-2}$ to $1.4\times 10^{-3}$ at an average signal-to-noise ratio of $30$ dB.</description>

      <title>Standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of Cohen's class time-frequency distribution with specific kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-frequency concentration and resolution of the Cohen's class time-frequency distribution (CCTFD) has attracted much attention in time-frequency analysis. A variety of uncertainty principles of the CCTFD is therefore derived, including the weak Heisenberg type, the Hardy type, the Nazarov type, and the local type. However, the standard Heisenberg type still remains unresolved. In this study, we address the question of how the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principle of the CCTFD is affected by fundamental properties. The investigated distribution properties are Parseval's relation and the concise frequency domain definition (i.e., only frequency variables are explicitly found in the tensor product), based on which we confine our attention to the CCTFD with some specific kernels. That is the unit modulus and v-independent time translation, reversal and scaling invariant kernel CCTFD (UMITRSK-CCTFD). We then extend the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the Wigner distribution to those of the UMITRSK-CCTFD, giving birth to various types of attainable lower bounds on the uncertainty product in the UMITRSK-CCTFD domain. The derived results strengthen the existing weak Heisenberg type and fill gaps in the standard Heisenberg type.</description>

      <title>Phasor-Pursuit Directional Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emitting phased array RF systems have to contend with an ever-increasing number of eavesdroppers as technological advancements provide lower cost and/or more capable radios. Often, eavesdroppers can accumulate sufficient information transmitted in sidelobes by integrating over long enough periods. Directional modulation (DM) disrupts this capability by inducing a randomized walk through IQ-space to reach a pertinent location which corresponds to a symbol of particular amplitude and phase. This results in higher secrecy capacity. The path taken by the cumulative element contributions are determined by the complex weights of individual transmitters. Because large phased arrays support a large number of available paths, repetitions of applied weights are not concerning. The same cannot be said for arrays that consist of only a few elements, e.g. WiFi routers. We introduce a computationally efficient and flexible framework for DM that utilizes real-valued phase rotations of element weights. It supports a wide family of modulation schemes in phase and/or amplitude. Using state-of-the-practice orthogonal noise injection framework, we demonstrate a richness of unique paths resolving concerns about repeated weights. In our proposed scheme, there is a small reduction in received power compared to traditional beamforming, as little as 1 dB, which is an advantage over conventional directional modulation which typically sacrifices 6 dB of power. Also, there is a significantly larger set of possible element weights than that of the conventional scheme. This feature protects against the possibility of eavesdroppers breaking the distortion-based obfuscation of symbols over repeated observations. Our approach provides more secrecy capacity than conventional directional modulation via increased power delivery and increased receiver SNR and does so with resilience to advanced eavesdropping threats.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antennas for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to deploy rotatable antennas (RAs) at the base station (BS) to enhance both communication and sensing (C&amp;S) performances, by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by array rotation. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the sum-rate of multiple communication users and minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for target angle estimation, by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors and the array rotation angle at the BS. To solve this problem, we first equivalently decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization and an outer problem for array rotation optimization. Although these two subproblems are non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and one-dimensional exhaustive search, respectively. Moreover, we show that for the communication-only case, RAs provide an additional rotation gain to improve communication performance; while for the sensing-only case, the equivalent spatial aperture can be enlarged by RAs for achieving higher sensing accuracy. Finally, numerical results are presented to showcase the performance gains of RAs over fixed-rotation antennas in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).</description>

      <title>Real-Time Risky Fault-Chain Search using Time-Varying Graph RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven graphical framework for the real-time search of risky cascading fault chains (FCs) in power-grids, crucial for enhancing grid resiliency in the face of climate change. As extreme weather events driven by climate change increase, identifying risky FCs becomes crucial for mitigating cascading failures and ensuring grid stability. However, the complexity of the spatio-temporal dependencies among grid components and the exponential growth of the search space with system size pose significant challenges to modeling and risky FC search. To tackle this, we model the search process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is subsequently solved via a time-varying graph recurrent neural network (GRNN). This approach captures the spatial and temporal structure induced by the system's topology and dynamics, while efficiently summarizing the system's history in the GRNN's latent space, enabling scalable and effective identification of risky FCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, while maintaining long-term coverage and achieving sub-linear regret. IM-OCP features closed-form updates with minimal memory complexity, and is designed to operate under potentially intermittent feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a new Gaussian Mixture Filter (GMF) to improve the estimation performance for the autonomous robotic radio signal source search and localization problem in unknown environments. The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-practice approaches such as Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters and Particle Filter (PF). Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world robotic applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</description>

      <title>BioSerenity-E1: a self-supervised EEG model for medical applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as an essential diagnostic tool in neurology; however, its accurate manual interpretation is a time-intensive process that demands highly specialized expertise, which remains relatively scarce and not consistently accessible. To address these limitations, the implementation of automated pre-screening and analysis systems for EEG data holds considerable promise. Advances in self-supervised learning made it possible to pre-train complex deep learning architectures on large volumes of unlabeled EEG data to learn generalizable representations, that can later be used to enhance performance on multiple tasks while needing less downstream data. In the present paper, we introduce BioSerenity-E1, the first of a family of self-supervised foundation models for clinical EEG applications that combines spectral tokenization with masked prediction to achieve state-of-the-art performance across relevant diagnostic tasks. The two-phase self-supervised pretraining framework initially acquires compressed EEG representations via a transformer-based VQ-VAE architecture designed to reconstruct log-multitaper spectral projections, then implements extensive (70% block) masked token prediction to force the model to learn complex spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals. BioSerenity-E1 achieves strong performance across three clinical tasks, either in line or above state-of-the-art methods: seizure detection (AUROC = 0.926, Sensitivity = 0.909), normal/abnormal classification (AUPRC = 0.970 on proprietary data; 0.910 on TUH-Abnormal), and multiclass pathology differentiation on unbalanced data (Weighted F1 = 0.730). The utility of BioSerenity-E1 is further confirmed in low-data regimes scenarios, showing clear improvements in AUPRC (from +2% to 17%) when trained on less than 10% of the available data.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Matrix Regression via Least-Angle Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix regression is a fundamental problem in data science with various applications in systems and control. Nuclear norm regularization has been widely applied to solve this problem due to its convexity. However, it suffers from high computational complexity and the inability to directly specify the rank. This work introduces a novel framework for low-rank matrix regression that addresses both unstructured and Hankel matrices. By decomposing the low-rank matrix into rank-1 bases, the problem is reformulated as an infinite-dimensional sparse learning problem. The least-angle regression (LAR) algorithm is then employed to solve this problem efficiently. For unstructured matrices, a closed-form LAR solution is derived with equivalence to a normalized nuclear norm regularization problem. For Hankel matrices, a real-valued polynomial basis reformulation enables effective LAR implementation. Two numerical examples in network modeling and system realization demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the nuclear norm method in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>ESTformer: Transformer Utilizing Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Electroencaphalogram Super-resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towards practical applications of Electroencephalography (EEG), lightweight acquisition devices garner significant attention. However, EEG channel selection methods are commonly data-sensitive and cannot establish a unified sound paradigm for EEG acquisition devices. Through reverse conceptualisation, we formulated EEG applications in an EEG super-resolution (SR) manner, but suffered from high computation costs, extra interpolation bias, and few insights into spatiotemporal dependency modelling. To this end, we propose ESTformer, an EEG SR framework that utilises spatiotemporal dependencies based on the transformer. ESTformer applies positional encoding methods and a multihead self-attention mechanism to the space and time dimensions, which can learn spatial structural correlations and temporal functional variations. ESTformer, with the fixed mask strategy, adopts a mask token to upsample low-resolution (LR) EEG data in the case of disturbance from mathematical interpolation methods. On this basis, we designed various transformer blocks to construct a spatial interpolation module (SIM) and a temporal reconstruction module (TRM). Finally, ESTformer cascades the SIM and TRM to capture and model the spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG SR with fidelity. Extensive experimental results on two EEG datasets show the effectiveness of ESTformer against previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the Transformer for EEG SR tasks. The superiority of the SR data was verified in an EEG-based person identification and emotion recognition task, achieving a 2% to 38% improvement compared with the LR data at different sampling scales.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Design for IRS-aided MIMO ISAC Based on Sensing Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Holistic KLD-based Waveform Design for Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) metric to analyse and optimise performance trade-offs in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments (UEs) and detects multiple targets using a shared antenna deployment. We apply this framework to the widely used zero-forcing (ZF) communication beamforming technique, to assess their impact on the radar subsystem's performance. Additionally, two optimisation problems are formulated: the first optimise the radar subsystem's KLD under communication constraints, and the second focuses on communication waveform KLD optimisation with constraints on the radar KLD. These problems are solved using a projected gradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a gradient-assisted interior point method (IPM) for the communication waveforms. As performance benchmarks, we propose two additional optimisation frameworks: a radar waveform optimisation with bit error rate (BE) constraints and a communication waveform optimisation that minimises BER under radar KLD constraints. Theoretical derivations and simulations show that our KLD-based approach effectively characterises and optimises the ISAC performance trade-offs. Results indicate significant improvements in both radar detection and communication performance over conventional ZF beamforming and the identity covariance radar design, while achieving performance comparable to BER-based optimisation but with notably lower computational complexity. These findings highlight the advantages of KLD-based optimisation in balancing radar and communication performance for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A General Sensing-assisted Channel Estimation Framework in Distributed MIMO Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 6G communications, it is envisioned to equip the traditional access point (AP) with sensing capability to fully benefit the existing wireless communication infrastructures. Thus, sensing-assisted communication has attracted significant attention from both industry and academia. However, most existing works focused on sensing-assisted communication in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios due to sensing limitations, where the sensing target (ST) and communication user equipment (UE) remain the same. In this paper, we propose a general sensing-assisted channel estimation framework in the distributed multiple-input and multiple-output (DMIMO) network and consider a scenario where the ST and UE are different entities. In addition, ST is a moving target (e.g. a robot) which causes channels between APs and UEs to vary due to changes in the reflection paths of the indoor environment. Therefore, we let multiple APs to jointly sense the position of the ST, which will be incorporated in a Ray tracing model to obtain a more accurate estimate of the channels from APs to UEs for both the LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing-assisted communication framework achieves a much higher channel estimation accuracy and downlink throughput compared to the traditional least-square (LS) channel estimation. More importantly, the feasibility of the proposed framework has been validated to guarantee the stringent channel estimation accuracy requirement in the DMIMO network.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided FDD Precoding with Sensing Heterogeneity: A Vertical Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High complexity in precoding design for frequency division duplex systems necessitates streamlined solutions. Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), this paper introduces a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing aided precoding scheme within a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework, which significantly minimizes pilot sequence length while optimizing the system's sum rate. We address the challenges posed by local data heterogeneity due to varying on-board sensor configurations through a meticulously designed VFL training procedure. To extract valuable channel features from multi-modal sensing, we employ three distinct data preprocessing methods that convert raw data into informative representations relevant for precoding. Additionally, we propose an online training strategy based on VFL framework, enabling the scheme to adapt dynamically to fluctuations in user numbers. Numerical results indicate that our approach, utilizing short pilot sequences, closely approximates the performance of traditional optimization methods with perfect channel state information.</description>

      <title>KAN-powered large-target detection for automotive radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel radar signal detection pipeline focused on detecting large targets such as cars and SUVs. Traditional methods, such as Ordered-Statistic Constant False Alarm Rate (OS-CFAR), commonly used in automotive radar, are designed for point or isotropic target models. These may not adequately capture the Range-Doppler (RD) scattering patterns of larger targets, especially in high-resolution radar systems. Additional modules such as association and tracking are necessary to refine and consolidate the detections over multiple dwells. To address these limitations, we propose a detection technique based on the probability density function (pdf) of RD segments, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold neural network (KAN) to learn the data and generate interpretable symbolic expressions for binary hypotheses. Beside the Monte-Carlo study showing better performance for the proposed KAN expression over OS-CFAR, it is shown to exhibit a probability of detection (PD) of 96% when transfer learned with field data. The false alarm rate (PFA) is comparable with OS-CFAR designed with PFA = $10^{-6}$. Additionally, the study also examines impact of the number of pdf bins representing RD segment on performance of the KAN-based detection.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tensor-Aided Channel Estimation for Hardware Impaired Device Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the joint generalized channel estimation and device identification problem in Internet of Things (IoT) networks {under multipath propagation}. To fully utilize the received signal, we decompose the generalized channel into three components: transmitter hardware characteristics, path gains, and angles of arrival. By modelling the received signals as parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensors, we develop alternating least squares (ALS)-based algorithms to simultaneously estimate the generalized channels and identify the transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms {both Khatri-Rao Factorization (KRF) and the conventional least squares (LS) method} in terms of channel estimation accuracy and achieves performance close to the derived Cramer-Rao lower bound.</description>

      <title>AI-Aided Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</description>
