      <title>The April 2023 SYM-H = -233 nT Geomagnetic Storm: A Classical Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 23-24 April 2023 double-peak (SYM-H intensities of -179 and -233 nT) intense geomagnetic storm was caused by interplanetary magnetic field southward component Bs associated with an interplanetary fast-forward shock-preceded sheath (Bs of 25 nT), followed by a magnetic cloud (MC) (Bs of 33 nT), respectively. At the center of the MC, the plasma density exhibited an order of magnitude decrease, leading to a sub-Alfvenic solar wind interval for ~2.1 hr. Ionospheric Joule heating accounted for a significant part (~81%) of the magnetospheric energy dissipation during the storm main phase. Equal amount of Joule heating in the dayside and nightside ionosphere is consistent with the observed intense and global-scale DP2 (disturbance polar) currents during the storm main phase. The sub-Alfvenic solar wind is associated with disappearance of substorms, a sharp decrease in Joule heating dissipation, and reduction in electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave amplitude. The shock/sheath compression of the magnetosphere led to relativistic electron flux losses in the outer radiation belt between L* = 3.5 and 5.5. Relativistic electron flux enhancements were detected in the lower L* &lt; 3.5 region during the storm main and recovery phases. Equatorial ionospheric plasma anomaly structures are found to be modulated by the prompt penetration electric fields. Around the anomaly crests, plasma density at ~470 km altitude and altitude-integrated ionospheric total electron content are found to increase by ~60% and ~80%, with ~33% and ~67% increases in their latitudinal extents compared to their quiet-time values, respectively.</description>

      <title>First results from a low cost software defined radio system monitoring VHF equatorial ionospheric scintillations in the Indian sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillations of radio frequency signals due to the ionosphere, despite having been studied for decades, is still an active area of research. Of particular interest is the scintillations near the geomagnetic equator, where such scintillations can be strong enough to cause disruptions to satellite communications. In this paper, a low cost system to monitor VHF scintillations is described. The system called the Personal Ionospheric Experiment (PIE) makes use of a widely available software defined radio (SDR) to perform the measurements. The use of an SDR vastly enhances the flexibility, especially in environments with non-negligible radio frequency interference (RFI). A simple technique to effectively subtract out transient RFI commonly found in radio data is detailed, and tested with data collected over several months. The utility of the proposed system is demonstrated with the analysis of a night-time scintillation patch; a few daytime scintillations are also reported. Therefore this paper demonstrates the feasibility of conducting useful low-cost radio science experiments in semi-urban locations with RFI, encouraging similar citizen science initiatives.</description>
