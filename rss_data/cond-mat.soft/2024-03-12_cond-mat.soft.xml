      <title>Understanding the shear modulus of dense microgel suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer microgels exhibit intriguing macroscopic flow properties arising from their unique microscopic structure. Microgel colloids comprise a crosslinked polymer network with a radially decaying density profile, resulting in a dense core surrounded by a fuzzy corona. Notably, microgels synthesized from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) are thermoresponsive, capable of adjusting their size and density profile based on temperature. Above the lower critical solution temperature ($T_\text{LCST}\sim 33$ $^\circ$C), the microgel's polymer network collapses, leading to the expulsion of water through a reversible process. Conversely, below $33$ $^\circ$C, the microgel's network swells, becoming highly compressible and allowing overpacking to effective volume fractions exceeding one. Under conditions of dense packing, microgels undergo deformation in distinct stages: corona compression and faceting, interpenetration, and finally, isotropic compression. Each stage exhibits a characteristic signature in the yield stress and elastic modulus of the dense microgel suspensions. Here, we introduce a model for the linear elastic shear modulus through the minimization of a quasi-equilibrium free energy, encompassing all relevant energetic contributions. We validate our model by comparing its predictions to experimental results from oscillatory shear rheology tests on microgel suspensions at different densities and temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that combining macroscopic rheological measurements with the model allows for temperature-dependent characterization of polymer interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>Steady Granular Flow in a Rotating Drum: Universal description of stress, velocity and packing fraction profiles covering grain shape effects from convex to very concave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow behavior of granular matter is significantly influenced by the shape of constituent particles. This effect is particularly pronounced for very concave particles, which exhibit unique flow characteristics such as higher porosity and sharper phase transitions between jamming and unjamming states. Despite the richness and ubiquitousness of these systems, our understanding of their intricate flow behavior and the local mechanisms driving these behaviors remains incomplete. In this work, we investigate the effect of particle shape, ranging from spherical to highly concave, on steady flows in a rotating drum - a system that facilitates a continuous phase transition from a jamming state at greater depths to an unjamming state at shallower regions. We develop an analytical model to elucidate granular behavior within the rotating drum: (i) Firstly, by decomposing the shear stress, we reconcile the discrepancy between simulation data and theoretical predictions, establishing a relationship with the angle of repose. (ii)Secondly, we extend the generalized Bagnold scaling , coupled with a non-local fluidity relation based on packing fraction, providing a framework for a correlation between shear stress, shear rate, and packing fraction. Additionally, we introduce a characteristic length to quantify the influence of particle shape and drum speed. This analytical model offers explicit functional forms for physical quantity profiles, which are validated experimentally in a thin rotating drum and numerically in a two-dimensional rotating drum. Our results demonstrate that this model accurately describes the change of velocity due to the phase transition of granular flow within a rotating drum. Moreover, for different shapes of particle and drum speeds, the characteristic length captures the interplay between shear stress, shear rate, and the variation of packing fraction.</description>

      <title>A twist-grain boundary (TGB) phase in aqueous solutions of the DNA tetramer GTAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a Twist Grain Boundary (TGB) phase of DNA, a striking motif of three dimensional (3D) equilibrium self-assembly of the DNA tetramer 5'-GTAC-3', a base sequence that is self-complimentary, pairing to form 4-base long, blunt-end Watson/Crick (WC) duplexes. Hydrophobic blunt ends and liquid crystal ordering enable these short duplexes to aggregate into long-DNA-like columns, even though the double helix has a break every 4 bases. A further step assembles these columns into monolayer sheets in which the columns are mutually parallel, and, finally, these sheets stack into lamellar arrays in which the column axis of each layer rotates in helical fashion, through a 60 degree angle with each passage to the next layer. This reorientation in a left-handed TGB helix enables each 2nm diameter WC column to be parallel to, and to partially enter, the major grooves of its neighbors.</description>

      <title>Hyper-density functional theory of soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous many-body systems. Extending the equilibrium ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. Simulation-based supervised machine learning trains neural networks that act as hyper-direct correlation functionals which facilitate efficient and accurate predictions. We exemplify the approach for the cluster statistics of hard rods and square well particles. The theory provides access to complex order parameters, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Melting of the two-dimensional solid phase in the Gaussian-core model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general theory for the melting of two dimensional solids explaining the universal and non-universal properties is an open problem up to date. Although the celebrated KTHNY theory have been able to predict the critical properties of the melting transition in a variety cases, it is already known that it is not able to capture the occurrence of first order transitions observed in certain systems as well as it doesn't provide a clear way to calculate the melting temperature for a specific model. In the present work we have developed an analytical method that combines Self Consistent Variational Approximation with the Renormalization Group in order to deal simultaneously with the phonon fluctuations and the topological defects present in the melting process of two dimensional crystals. The method was applied with impressive success to the study of the phase diagram of the Gaussian-core model, capturing not only the reentrant feature of its 2D solid phase, but also the related critical temperatures as a function of the density in quantitative detail. The developed method can be directly applied to study the melting of any hexagonal simple crystal formed by particles interacting through any finite pairwise interaction potential. Additionally, it has the potential to explain the occurrence of first order transitions in the melting process of two dimensional crystals.</description>

      <title>A self-assembled periodic nanoporous framework in aqueous solutions of the DNA tetramer GCCG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective behavior of the shortest DNA oligomers in high concentration aqueous solutions is an unexplored frontier of DNA science and technology. Here we broaden the realm of DNA nanoscience by demonstrating that single-component aqueous solutions of the DNA 4-base oligomer GCCG can spontaneously organize into three-dimensional (3D) periodic mesoscale frameworks. This oligomer can form B-type double helices by Watson-Crick (WC) pairing, into tiled brickwork-like duplex strands, which arrange into mutually parallel arrays and form the nematic and columnar liquid crystal phases, as is typical for long WC chains. However, at DNA concentrations above 400mg/mL, these solutions nucleate and grow an additional mesoscale framework phase, comprising a periodic network on a three dimensional body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. This lattice is an array of nodes (valence-8, each formed by a pair of quadruplexes of GCCG terminal Gs), connected with a separation of 6.6 nm by struts (6-GCCG-long WC duplexes). This 3D-ordered DNA framework is of low density (DNA volume fraction ~0.2), but, due to its 3D crystal structure, is osmotically incompressible over its phase range. Atomistic simulations confirm the stability of such structures, which promise to form the basis of novel families of simply and inexpensively made nanoscale frameworks for templating and selection applications.</description>
