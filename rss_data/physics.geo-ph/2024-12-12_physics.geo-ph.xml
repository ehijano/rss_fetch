      <title>Filling the gap in the IERS C01 polar motion series in 1858.9-1860.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IERS C01 Earth orientation parameters (EOP) series contains the longest reliable record of the Earth's rotation. In particular, the polar motion (PM) series beginning from 1846 provides a basis for investigation of the long-term PM variations. However, the pole coordinate Yp in the IERS C01 PM series has a 2-year gap, which makes this series not completely evenly spaced. This paper presents the results of the first attempt to overcome this problem and discusses possible ways to fill this gap. Two novel approaches were considered for this purpose: deterministic astronomical model consisting of the bias and the Chandler and annual wobbles with linearly changing amplitudes, and statistical data-driven model based on the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Both methods were tested with various options to ensure robust and reliable results. The results obtained by the two methods generally agree within the Yp errors in the IERS C01 series, but the results obtained by the SSA approach can be considered preferable because it is based on a more complete PM model.</description>

      <title>A hybrid Finite Element and Material Point Method for modeling liquefaction-induced tailings dam failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point Method (MPM) approach for modeling liquefaction-induced tailings dam failures from initiation through runout. We apply this method to simulate the 1978 Mochikoshi tailings dam failure, which occurred due to seismic loading and liquefaction during an earthquake. Our approach leverages FEM to capture the initial failure mechanism and MPM to simulate the subsequent runout, exploiting the strength of each method in their respective phases of the failure process. We investigate the impact of the FEM-to-MPM transfer time on runout results, identifying an optimal transfer window. This window begins when liquefaction reaches a critical depth to fully trigger the failure and ends before excessive mesh deformation occurs. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the liquefied tailings significantly influence runout predictions. Notably, we achieve runout distances comparable to the case history only when incorporating additional strain-softening beyond the initial liquefaction-induced strength reduction. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid FEM-MPM method effectively models tailings dam failures associated with complex failure mechanisms and large runouts. This approach offers a promising tool for predicting the runout of seismic liquefaction-induced tailings dam failures, improving risk assessment and mitigation strategies in tailings dam management.</description>

      <title>Rapid Bayesian Seismic Tomography using Graph Mixture Density Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic tomography is a methodology to image subsurface properties of the Earth. In order to better interpret the resulting images, it is important to assess uncertainty in the results. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an efficient way to estimate Bayesian posterior probability density functions (pdfs) that describe the uncertainty of tomographic images. However, the method can only be applied in cases where the number of data is fixed, and consequently a large number of practical applications that have variable data sizes cannot be solved. To resolve this issue, we introduce graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve seismic tomographic problems. Graphs are data structure which provides flexible representation of complex, variable systems. GNNs are neural networks that manipulates graph data, and can be combined with MDNs (called graph MDNs) to provide efficient estimates of posterior pdfs for graph data. In this study we apply graph MDNs to seismic tomography by representing travel time data with a graph. We demonstrate the method using both synthetic and real data, and compare the results with those obtained using Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC). The results show that graph MDNs can provide comparable posterior pdfs to those obtained using McMC at significantly lower cost. We thus conclude that graph MDNs can be used in a range of practical applications that require many similar seismic tomographic problems with different number of data to be solved.</description>

      <title>Identifying probabilistic weather regimes targeted to a local-scale impact variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather regimes are recurrent and persistent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that modulate the occurrence of local impact variables such as extreme precipitation. In their capacity as mediators between long-range teleconnections and these local extremes, they have shown potential for improving sub-seasonal forecasting as well as long-term climate projections. However, existing methods for identifying weather regimes are not designed to capture the physical processes relevant to the impact variable in question while still representing the full atmospheric phase space. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic machine learning method, RMM-VAE, for identifying weather regimes targeted to a local-scale impact variable. Based on a variational autoencoder architecture, the method combines non-linear dimensionality reduction with a prediction task and probabilistic clustering in a coherent architecture. The new method is applied to identify circulation patterns over the Mediterranean region targeted to precipitation over Morocco and compared to three existing approaches, two established linear methods and another machine learning approach. The RMM-VAE method identifies regimes that are more predictive of the target variable compared to the two linear methods, and more robust and persistent compared to the alternative machine learning method, while also improving the reconstruction of the input space. The results demonstrate the potential benefit of the new method for use in various climate applications such as sub-seasonal forecasting, while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in targeted clustering.</description>

      <title>GeoFlood: Computational model for overland flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlood, a new open-source software package for solving shallow water equations (SWE) on a quadtree hierarchy of mapped, logically Cartesian grids managed by the parallel, adaptive library ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, 2017). The GeoFlood model is validated using standard benchmark tests from Neelz and Pender (2013) and against George (2011) results obtained from the GeoClaw software (Clawpack Development Team, 2020) for the historical Malpasset dam failure problem. The benchmark test results are compared against GeoClaw and software package HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center - River Analysis System, Army Corp of Engineers) results (Brunner, 2018). This comparison demonstrates the capability of GeoFlood to accurately and efficiently predict flood wave propagation on complex terrain. The results from comparisons with the Malpasset dam break show good agreement with the GeoClaw results and are consistent with the historical records of the event.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is intended for teaching Signal Analysis methods and Inverse Problems theory. It is completely open access and will remain free. It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. It is also available in French ( https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yx9le4tbwjg0ur7llp0fj/TheorieInfoTTS_vf.pdf?rlkey=uvc1ku8v4ihhogkcy0w2iixdf&amp;st=gcddwegm&amp;dl=0 ) and Portuguese ( https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mx46mgn66ob3r1z9r0igq/TheorieInfoTTS_vp.pdf?rlkey=c8m9e8dmbwf1npu4bwfqkhblr&amp;st=xveovcvs&amp;dl=0 ).

      <title>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4% for Uranium-238 and 9% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10% to 20%. Our study represents a significant advancement in geo-neutrino research, establishing a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.</description>
