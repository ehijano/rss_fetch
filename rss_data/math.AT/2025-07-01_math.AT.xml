      <title>Higher path groupoids and the holonomy of formal power series connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on ideas of Kohno, we develop a framework for the construction of higher holonomy functors via the transport of formal power series connections. Using these techniques, we obtain functors from the path groupoid, the path 2-groupoid, and the path 3-groupoid of a manifold. As an application, we construct a Gray functor from the path 3-groupoid of the configuration space of $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geqslant 4$.</description>

      <title>A model structure on the category of A$_\infty$-categories with strict morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of (strictly unital) A$_\infty$-categories, linear over a commutative ring $R$, with strict A$_\infty$-morphisms has a cofibrantly generated model structure. In this model structure every object is fibrant and the cofibrant objects have cofibrant morphisms. As a consequence we prove that the semi-free A$_\infty$-categories (resp. resolutions) are cofibrant objects (resp. resolution) in this model structure.</description>

      <title>Shifted Lagrangian thickenings of shifted Poisson derived schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the space of shifted Poisson structures on a derived scheme $X$ locally of finite presentation is equivalent to the space of shifted Lagrangian thickenings out $X$, solving a conjecture in shifted Poisson geometry. As a corollary, we show that for $M$ a compact oriented $d$-dimensional manifold and an $n$-shifted Poisson structure on $X$, the mapping stack $\mathrm{Map}(M,X)$ has an $(n-d)$-shifted Poisson structure. It extends a known theorem for shifted symplectic structures to shifted Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Anderson duality of topological modular forms and its differential-geometric manifestations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study a morphism of spectra implementing the Anderson duality of topological modular forms ($\mathrm{TMF}$). Its differential version will then be introduced, allowing us to pair elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$ with spin manifolds whose boundaries are equipped with string structure. A few negative-degree elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$ will then be constructed using the theory of $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded $\mathrm{TMF}$, and will be identified using the differential pairing. We also discuss a conjecture relating vertex operator algebras and negative-degree elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$, underlying much of the discussions of this paper. The paper ends with a separate appendix for physicists, in which the contents of the paper are summarized and translated into their language.</description>

      <title>$K(2)$-local splittings of finite Galois extensions of $MU\langle6\rangle$ and $MString$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Milnor-Moore argument we show that, $K(2)$-locally at the prime $2$, the spectra $MU\langle 6\rangle$ and $MString$ split as direct sums of Morava $E$-theories after tensoring with a finite Galois extension of the sphere called $E^{hF_{3/2}}$. In the case of $MString$ we are able to refine this splitting in several ways: we show that the projection maps are determined by spin characteristic classes, that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation admits a unital section after tensoring with $E^{hF_{3/2}}$, and that the splitting can be improved to one of $E^{hH}\otimes MString$ into a direct sum of shifts of $TMF_0(3)$ where $H$ is an open subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group of index $4$.</description>

      <title>Manifold Diffusion Geometry: Curvature, Tangent Spaces, and Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce novel estimators for computing the curvature, tangent spaces, and dimension of data from manifolds, using tools from diffusion geometry. Although classical Riemannian geometry is a rich source of inspiration for geometric data analysis and machine learning, it has historically been hard to implement these methods in a way that performs well statistically. Diffusion geometry lets us develop Riemannian geometry methods that are accurate and, crucially, also extremely robust to noise and low-density data. The methods we introduce here are comparable to the existing state-of-the-art on ideal dense, noise-free data, but significantly outperform them in the presence of noise or sparsity. In particular, our dimension estimate improves on the existing methods on a challenging benchmark test when even a small amount of noise is added. Our tangent space and scalar curvature estimates do not require parameter selection and substantially improve on existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Non vanishing of the fourth bounded cohomology of free groups and codimension 2 subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove that the fouth bounded cohomology of non-abelian free
  groups with trivial real coefficients is non-zero. In order to prove this, we
  establish a splitting argument whose simplest form is as follows: Let
  $M$ denote an $n$-manifold of non-zero simplicial volume and
  $S$ a codimension two submanifold of $M$, then one can
  conclude that the $n$-th bounded cohomology of the fundamental group of
  $M \setminus S$ is non-zero.
  While in this note this approach is only used for degree $4$. There is no
  reason to expect that this approach and its generalizations is not suitable
  to prove the non-vanishing of higher degrees or the bounded cohomology of
  different groups as well.</description>

      <title>Lie-operads and operadic modules from poset cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Global representation theory: Homological foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the groups belonging to some collection of finite groups $\mathscr{U}$. Global representations assemble into an abelian category $\mathsf{A}(\mathscr{U})$, simultaneously generalising classical representation theory and the category of VI-modules appearing in the representation theory of the general linear groups. In this paper we establish homological foundations of its derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U})$. We prove that any complex of projective global representations is DG-projective, and hence conclude that the derived category admits an explicit model as the homotopy category of projective global representations. We show that from a tensor-triangular perspective it exhibits some unusual features: for example, there are very few dualizable objects and in general many more compact objects. Under more restrictive conditions on the family $\mathscr{U}$, we then construct torsion-free classes for global representations which encode certain growth properties in $\mathscr{U}$. This lays the foundations for a detailed study of the tensor-triangular geometry of derived global representations which we pursue in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Non Hausdorff Counterexample in Covering Space Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a one dimensional, second countable, simply connected manifold that exhibits a single non Hausdorff fiber, sufficient to destroy the fundamental properties of classical covering space theory. The space, called the line with k inseparable origins, is defined by taking k copies of the real line and identifying all nonzero points across copies, so that each copy retains a distinct origin. These origins are T1 separated but not Hausdorff separated.
  We embed the punctured real line into a closed disk with a single accumulation point, and project the nonzero locus homeomorphically onto the embedded image. The projection map collapses all origins to the puncture point. Away from the singular point, the map is a local homeomorphism. At the singular point, however, the fiber is non Hausdorff: every neighborhood of one origin contains the others.
  As a consequence, path lifting and homotopy lifting fail, the monodromy representation is undefined, and the group of deck transformations is isomorphic to the symmetric group on k letters. Despite the total space being simply connected, the map cannot be classified as a covering map, branched cover, semicovering, or \'etale morphism.
  This provides a minimal dimensional, fully explicit example showing that the failure of Hausdorff separation at a single fiber suffices to break lifting properties and eliminate the usual Galois type correspondence between fundamental groups and deck transformations. It presents a sharp obstruction to any naive extension of covering space theory to non Hausdorff settings.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received growing attention. While estimating Betti numbers is a central task in TDA, general complexity theoretic limitations restrict the possibility of quantum speedups. To address this, we explore quantum algorithms under a more structured input model. We show that access to additional topological information enables improved quantum algorithms for estimating Betti and persistent Betti numbers. Building on this, we introduce a new approach based on homology tracking, which avoids computing the kernel of combinatorial Laplacians used in prior methods. This yields a framework that remains efficient even when Betti numbers are small, offering substantial and sometimes exponential speedups. Beyond Betti number estimation, we formulate and study the homology property testing problem, and extend our approach to the cohomological setting. We present quantum algorithms for testing triviality and distinguishing homology classes, revealing new avenues for quantum advantage in TDA.</description>
