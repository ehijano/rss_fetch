      <title>A Method for Calculating Attenuation in Creeping Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase lag between an applied forcing and a response to that forcing is a fundamen tal parameter in geophysical signal processing. For solid deforming materials, the phase lag between an oscillatory applied stress and the resulting strain response encapsulates information about the dynamical behavior of materials and attenuation. The phase lag is not directly measured and must be extracted through multiple steps by carefully comparing two time-series signals. The extracted value of the phase lag is highly sensitive to the analysis method, and often there are no comparable values to increase confidence in the calculated results. In this study, we propose a method for extracting the phase lag between two signals when either one or both include an underlying nonlinear trend, which is very common when measuring attenuation in creeping materials. We demonstrate the robustness of the method by analyzing artificial signals with known phases and quantifying their absolute and relative errors. We apply the method to two experimental datasets and compare our results with those of previous studies</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Real-World Accelerometer Data Quality in a Global Smartphone-based Seismic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of low-cost sensors in smartphones has facilitated numerous applications; however, large-scale deployments often encounter performance issues. Sensing heterogeneity, which refers to varying data quality due to factors such as device differences and user behaviors, presents a significant challenge. In this research, we perform an extensive analysis of 3-axis accelerometer data from the MyShake system, a global seismic network utilizing smartphones. We systematically evaluate the quality of approximately 22 million 3-axis acceleration waveforms from over 81 thousand smartphone devices worldwide, using metrics that represent sampling rate and noise level. We explore a broad range of factors influencing accelerometer data quality, including smartphone and accelerometer manufacturers, phone specifications (release year, RAM, battery), geolocation, and time. Our findings indicate that multiple factors affect data quality, with accelerometer model and smartphone specifications being the most critical. Additionally, we examine the influence of data quality on earthquake parameter estimation and show that removing low-quality accelerometer data enhances the accuracy of earthquake magnitude estimation.</description>

      <title>On the performance of sequential Bayesian update for database of diverse tsunami scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the sequential tsunami scenario detection framework was validated in our previous work, several tasks remain to be resolved from a practical point of view. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the previous tsunami scenario detection framework using a diverse database consisting of complex fault rupture patterns with heterogeneous slip distributions. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of scenario superposition to that of the previous most likely scenario detection method. Additionally, how the length of the observation time window influences the accuracy of both methods is analyzed. We utilize an existing database comprising 1771 tsunami scenarios targeting the city Westport (WA, U.S.), which includes synthetic wave height records and inundation distributions as the result of fault rupture in the Cascadia subduction zone. The heterogeneous patterns of slips used in the database increase the diversity of the scenarios and thus make it a proper database for evaluating the performance of scenario superposition. To assess the performance, we consider various observation time windows shorter than 15 minutes and divide the database into five testing and learning sets. The evaluation accuracy of the maximum offshore wave, inundation depth, and its distribution is analyzed to examine the advantages of the scenario superposition method over the previous method. We introduce the dynamic time warping (DTW) method as an additional benchmark and compare its results to that of the Bayesian scenario detection method.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectrum of 2D internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves without relying on the hydrostatic approximation. This spectrum is an exact solution of the kinetic equation after the shear modes are removed, and it agrees with the oceanic Garrett-Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. Among a continuous family of solutions to the kinetic equation, we show that the turbulent solution is the special solution with non zero angular dependent radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight of how turbulent energy cascade proceeds in anisotropic systems - similarly to isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency.</description>
