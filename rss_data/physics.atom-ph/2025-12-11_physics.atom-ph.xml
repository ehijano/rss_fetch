      <title>Table-top all-attosecond transient absorption spectrscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) has emerged as a powerful technique within the field of attosecond science, combining extremely high temporal and excellent spectral resolution. So far, ATAS has been implemented in pump-probe experiments where an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pump or probe pulse was combined with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse in the femtosecond range, with the attosecond time resolution deriving from sub-cycle NIR-driven dynamics. Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS). Here we demonstrate time-resolved AATAS using a table-top high-harmonic generation (HHG) source. The method is applied to investigate previously unresolved electronic coherences in Xe, revealing oscillatory valence hole motion with a 3-femtosecond period. In addition, systematic investigations of electron dynamics in Kr, Ar, and Ne are presented. Our work shows that, thanks to its broad bandwidth, high stability and easy accessibility, HHG is an ideal source for AATAS, offering the potential for replication in numerous laboratories.</description>

      <title>Subradiant collective states for precision sensing via transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an ensemble of quantum emitters interacts with a common radiation field, their emission becomes collective, giving rise to superradiant and subradiant states, characterized by broadened and narrowed linewidths. In this work, we propose to harness subradiant states for quantum metrology; such states naturally arise in subwavelength-spaced atomic arrays in free space and in small ensembles of emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides. We demonstrate that their collective optical response yields sharp, narrow features in the transmittance spectrum, which can be used to enhance sensitivity to external perturbations. This improved sensitivity can be applied to atomic clock operation, spatially resolved imaging of emitter positions, and enables precise detection of both global and spatially varying detunings (such as those induced by electromagnetic fields or gravitational gradients).</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation of molecules in the regime of strong ro-vibrational coupling: Comparison between an optical centrifuge and a transform-limited pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the ability of an optical centrifuge - a laser pulse whose linear polarization is rotating at an accelerated rate, to control molecular rotation in the regime when the rigid-rotor approximation breaks down due to coupling between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Our analysis demonstrates that the centrifuge field enables controlled excitation of high rotational states while maintaining relatively low spread along the vibrational coordinate. We contrast this to the rotational excitation by a linearly polarized Gaussian pulse of equal spectral width and pulse energy which, although comparable to the centrifuge-induced rotation, is unavoidably accompanied by a substantial broadening of the vibrational wavepacket.</description>

      <title>Programmable Assembly of Ground State Fermionic Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above 98.5\%. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single \qty{20}{\us} exposure, and \qty{3}{\s} experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Optical-field-induced dips and splits in nonlinear spectra of selective reflection from high-density atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss nonlinear spectra of selective reflection from high-density rubidium atomic vapor, where the self-broadening of the resonant transition $5S_{1/2}-5P_{3/2}$ dominates over the Doppler width. In the experiments, the hole-burning technique with probe and pump lasers is used. The reflection of weak probe beam is investigated at four atomic densities in the range $(1.2\text{--}3.6)\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$ and various pump beam intensities. To enhance the spectral resolution, the frequency derivative $\text{d}R/\text{d}\nu$ of the reflection coefficient $R$ is analyzed. Increasing the atomic number density changes the character of self-broadening from inhomogeneous to homogeneous. At the highest density, the strong pump field splits the observed spectra into two homogeneously broadened symmetric resonances. The appearance of the optical-field-induced resonances can be explained within the framework of "dressed atomic states" approach. At lower densities the spectral profiles are inhomogeneously broadened. Spectral profiles of the frequency derivative are separated by optically saturated dips. The width of such dips is a combination of the homogeneous component of self-broadening and intensity-dependent field broadening. Careful study of the transition from inhomogeneous to homogeneous broadening may initiate further development of the theory of interatomic interactions in high density atomic gas media.</description>

      <title>Model-independent determination of nuclear charge radii from Li-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that recent advances in QED theory of Li-like ions [V. A. Yerokhin et al., Phys. Rev. A 112, 042801 (2025)] enable determinations of absolute nuclear charge radii for heavy elements. By incorporating constraints derived from electron-scattering data, we obtain radii that are independent of the assumed model of the nuclear charge distribution. Our approach is validated for $^{208}$Pb, a well-studied spherical nucleus, and is then applied to $^{209}$Bi, where low-lying nuclear excitations complicate the interpretation of muonic-atom data.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of out simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>
