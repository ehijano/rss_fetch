      <title>Complexity of the Zero Set of a Matrix Schubert Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $T$-varieties are normal varieties equipped with an action of an algebraic torus $T$. When the action is effective, the complexity of a $T$-variety $X$ is $\dim(X)-\dim(T)$. Matrix Schubert varieties, introduced by Fulton in 1992, are $T$-varieties consisting of $n \times n$ matrices satisfying certain constraints on the ranks of their submatrices. In this paper, we focus on the complexity of certain torus-fixed affine subvarieties of matrix Schubert varieties. Concretely, given a matrix Schubert variety $\overline{X_{w}}$ where $w\in S_n$, we study the complexity of $Y_w$ obtained by the decomposition $\overline{X_{w}} = Y_{w} \times \mathbb{C}^{k}$ with $k$ as large as possible. Building up from results by Escobar and M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and Donten-Bury, Escobar, and Portakal, we show that for a fixed $n$, the complexity of $Y_{w}$ with respect to this action can be any integer between $0$ and $(n-1)(n-3)$, except $1$.</description>

      <title>Torus Actions on Matrix Schubert and Kazhdan-Lusztig Varieties, and their Links to Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the toric geometry of two families of generalised determinantal varieties arising from permutations: Matrix Schubert varieties ($\overline{X_w}$) and Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties ($\Nvw$). Matrix Schubert varieties can be written as $\overline{X_w} = Y_w \times \mathbb C^d$, where $d$ is maximal. We are especially interested in the structure and complexity of these varieties $Y_w$ and $\Nvw$ under the so-called usual torus actions. In the case when $Y_w$ is toric, we provide a full characterisation of the simple reflections $s_i$ that render ${Y_{w \cdot s_i}}$ toric, as well as the corresponding changes to the weight cone. For Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties, we consider how moving one of the two permutations $v,w$ along a chain in the Bruhat poset affects their complexity. Additionally, we study the complexity of these varieties, for permutations $v$ and $w$ of a specific structure. Finally, we consider the links between these determinantal varieties and two classes of statistical models; namely conditional independence and quasi-independence models.</description>

      <title>Unboundedness for motivic invariants of birational automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce horizontal and vertical motivic invariants of birational maps between rational dominant maps and study their basic properties. As a first application, we show that the (usual) motivic invariants vanish for birational automorphisms of threefolds over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. On the other hand, we prove that the motivic invariants of the birational automorphism group of many types of varieties, including projective spaces of dimension at least four over a field of characteristic zero, do not form a bounded family, even after extending scalars to the algebraic closure of the field. For such varieties, we further show that their birational automorphism groups are not generated by maps preserving a conic bundle or a rational surface fibration structure, and their abelianizations do not stabilize.</description>

      <title>Higher dimensional geometry of $p$-jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a quantitative version of the prime-to-$p$ Manin--Mumford conjecture for varieties with ample cotangent bundle.
  More precisely, let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $F$, and let $X$ be a smooth projective subvariety of $A$ with ample cotangent bundle. We prove that for every prime $p\gg 0$, the intersection of $X(F^{\text{alg}})$ and the geometric prime-to-$p$ torsion of $A$ is finite and explicitly bounded by a summation involving cycle classes in the Chow ring of the reduction of $X$ modulo $p$. This result is a higher dimensional analogue of Buium's quantitative Manin--Mumford for curves.
  Our proof follows a similar outline to Buium's in that it heavily relies on his theory of arithmetic jet spaces. In this context, we prove that the special fiber of the arithmetic jet space associated to a model of $X$ is affine as a scheme over $\mathbb{F}_p^{\text{alg}}$. As an application of our results, we use a result of Debarre to prove that when $X$ is $\mathbb{Q}^{\text{alg}}$-isomorphic to a complete intersection of $c &gt; \text{dim}(A)/2$ many general hypersurfaces of $A_{\mathbb{Q}^{\text{alg}}}$ of sufficiently large degree, the intersection of $X(F^{\text{alg}})$ and the geometric prime-to-$p$ torsion of $A$ is bounded by a polynomial that depends only on $p$, the dimension of the ambient abelian variety, and intersection numbers of certain products of the hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Extensions Of Unirational Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a study of extensions of unirational algebraic groups. We prove that extensions of unirational groups are also unirational over fields of degree of imperfection $1$, but that this fails over every field of higher degree of imperfection, answering a question of Achet. We also initiate a study of those groups which admit filtrations with unirational graded pieces, and show that one may deduce unirationality of unipotent groups from unirationality of certain quotients.</description>

      <title>The Enriquez connection for higher genus polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the variation of the Enriquez connection for higher genus polylogarithms under degenerations of Riemann surfaces with marked points, and show that this connection becomes the connection constructed by the author for degenerating families of pointed Riemann surfaces. Therefore, we have an important application that the higher genus polylogarithms derived from the Enriquez connection can be described explicitly as power series in deformation parameters and their logarithms associated with the families whose coefficients are expressed by multiple zeta values.</description>

      <title>Chambers and walls in spaces of real algebraic curves of small degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews known results on the rigid isotopy classification of plane curves of degree $m\leq6$ and curves of small degrees on quadrics. The paper's study completes the rigid isotopy classification of nonsingular real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) on a hyperboloid, begun by the author in earlier works. There are given previously missing proofs of the uniqueness of the connected components for 16 classes of real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) having a single node or a cusp. The main technical tools are graphs of real trigonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces. Adjacency graphs of chambers and walls in the spaces of these curves are presented.</description>

      <title>The SYZ conjecture for singular moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the SYZ conjecture for irreducible symplectic varieties that are locally trivial deformation equivalent to moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces. As an intermediate step in the argument, we generalise to the singular setting a result of Kamenova--Verbitsky and Matsushita about moduli spaces of lagrangian fibrations of primitive symplectic varieties. Two further corollaries are also presented: the computation of the Huybrechts--Riemann--Roch polynomial and of the polarisation type of this kind of symplectic varieties.</description>

      <title>Atypical Hodge Loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent works of a number of people there has emerged a beautiful new perspective on the arithmetic properties of Hodge structures. A central result in that development appears in a paper by Baldi, Klingler, and Ullmo. In this expository work we will explain that result and give a proof. The main conceptual step is to formulate Noether-Lefschetz loci in terms of intersections of period images with Mumford-Tate subdomains of period domains. The main technical step is to use the alignment of the Hodge and root space decompositions of the Lie algebras of the associated groups and from it to use the integrability conditions associated to a Pfaffian PDE system. These integrability conditions explain the generally present excess intersection property associated to the integral varieties of a pair of Pfaffian exterior differential systems.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a stratification on the reduced special fiber of the basic unramified unitary Rapoport-Zink space of signature $(1,n-1)$ and at arbitrary parahoric level. We prove the smoothness, irreducibility and compute the dimensions of the closed strata, which are isomorphic to the closure of certain fine Deligne-Lusztig varieties for a product of unitary and general linear groups. We also describe the incidence relations of the stratification by using Bruhat-Tits indices, which are related to the Bruhat-Tits building of an underlying $p$-adic unitary group.</description>

      <title>The Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on $\mathcal{A}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{a}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergstr\"om, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>On the finite irreducible subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of the finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a classical problem in the field of finite group theory, dating back to the late 19th century with authors like Klein, Jordan, Blichfeldt, etc. Throughout its long history, many results concerning the classification have been scattered in the mathematical literature. In this survey, we explore many of the most relevant results related to the classification, its structure, and the lists of groups. We mostly focus on the irreducible groups. In particular, classification statements are provided for primitive and imprimitive groups over prime dimension, and quasi-primitive groups of small composite dimension. We also provide tables with a detailed list of all (quasi)-primitive finite groups of dimension $n&lt;8$. Finally, we provide a computer program implementing many of the known results specific to the finite quasisimple irreducible projective groups, to improve and preserve the accessibility to these results and further their classification. See \S 4.2 and [37].
  We aim this survey to the non-specialist, so the provided classification results may easily accessible to mathematicians working outside of group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(3,2)$ Shimura varieties. Such Shimura varieties parametrize abelian varieties in characteristic $p$ of dimension $5$ with an action of signature $(3,2)$ by an order in an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ is inert. We completely describe the interaction of two stratifications of these Shimura varieties: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. We identify which Ekedahl-Oort and Newton strata intersect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0418</link>
      <description>arXiv:0810.0418v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending work of Klyachko and Perling, we develop a combinatorial description of pure equivariant sheaves of any dimension on an arbitrary nonsingular toric variety $X$. Using geometric invariant theory (GIT), this allows us to construct explicit moduli spaces of pure equivariant sheaves on $X$ corepresenting natural moduli functors (similar to work of Payne in the case of equivariant vector bundles). The action of the algebraic torus on $X$ lifts to the moduli space of all Gieseker stable sheaves on $X$ and we express its fixed point locus explicitly in terms of moduli spaces of pure equivariant sheaves on $X$. One of the problems arising is to find an equivariant line bundle on the side of the GIT problem, which precisely recovers Gieseker stability. In the case of torsion free equivariant sheaves, we can always construct such equivariant line bundles. As a by-product, we get a combinatorial description of the fixed point locus of the moduli space of $\mu$-stable reflexive sheaves on $X$. As an application, we show in a sequel how these methods can be used to compute generating functions of Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of $\mu$-stable torsion free sheaves on nonsingular complete toric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Boundary of the moduli space of stable cubic fivefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4525</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.4525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using geometric invariant theory (GIT), we construct a compactification of the moduli space of stable cubic fivefolds by adjoining strictly semistable hypersurfaces. We show that the strictly semistable locus decomposes into 21 irreducible components, and for each we give an explicit closed SL(7)-orbit representative in normal form together with its component dimension. By computing saturated Jacobian ideals of these representatives, we obtain a detailed description of boundary singularities. In contrast with cubic threefolds and fourfolds, dimension five exhibits new phenomena: exactly two closed-orbit representatives carry an isolated quasi-homogeneous hypersurface singularity of type QH(3)_{19} (corank 3 with Milnor and Tjurina numbers $\mu=\tau=19$), while among positive-dimensional singular loci we encounter, besides lines, smooth conics, quadric surfaces (including a rank-3 cone) and CI(2,2) space quartics, also a quadric threefold and a quadric threefold cone. We further determine the adjacency relations among boundary components as wall crossings in Kirwan's stratification, finding exactly eight nontrivial pairwise intersections. Our methods combine a convex-geometric enumeration of maximal T-strictly semistable supports for Hilbert-Mumford weights, 1-PS limits with Luna's centralizer reduction, polystability via the convex-hull and Casimiro-Florentino criteria, and Groebner-basis computations (with a Rabinowitsch trick) certifying non-inclusions.</description>

      <title>Proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture I: construction of the functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the geometric Langlands functor in one direction (from the automorphic to the spectral side) in characteristic zero settings (i.e., de Rham and Betti). We prove that various forms of the conjecture (de Rham vs Betti, restricted vs. non-restricted, tempered vs. non-tempered) are equivalent. We also discuss structural properties of Hecke eigensheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the final paper in the series of five, in which we prove the geometric Langlands conjecture (GLC). We conclude the proof of GLC by showing that there exists a unique (up to tensoring up by a vector space) Hecke eigensheaf corresponding to an irreducible local system (hence, the title of the paper). We achieve this by analyzing the geometry of the stack of local systems.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic finiteness of Mukai varieties of genus 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study arithmetic finiteness of prime Fano threefolds of genus 7 and their higher dimensional generalization, called Mukai varieties of genus 7. For prime Fano threefolds of genus 7, we provide an arithmetic refinement of the Torelli theorem, obtain Shafarevich-type finiteness results, and show the failure of the N\'eron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion of good reduction. For Mukai varieties of genus 7, we prove that Shafarevich-type finiteness results hold in dimensions 9 and 10, but fail in dimension 6. In addition, we show that Mukai $n$-folds of genus 7 over $\mathbb{Z}$ do not exist for $n \leq 4$, whereas they exist for $5 \leq n \leq 10$.</description>

      <title>On the volume of K-semistable Fano manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the anti-canonical volume of an $n$-dimensional K-semistable Fano manifold that is not $\mathbb{P}^n$ is at most $2n^n$. Moreover, the volume is equal to $2n^n$ if and only if $X\cong \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ or $X$ is a smooth quadric hypersurface $Q\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}$. Our proof is based on a new connection between K-semistability and minimal rational curves.</description>

      <title>Rank 3 Quadratic Generators of Veronese Embeddings: The Characteristic 3 Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates property QR(3) for Veronese embeddings over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $3$. We determine the rank index of $(\mathbb{P}^n , \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n} (d))$ for all $n \geq 2$, $d \geq 3$, proving that it equals $3$ in these cases. Our approach adapts the inductive framework of [HLMP 2021], re-proving key lemmas for characteristic $3$ to establish quadratic generation by rank $3$ forms. We further compute the codimension of the span of rank $3$ quadrics in the space of quadratic equations of the second Veronese embedding, showing it grows as ${n+1 \choose 4}$. This provides a clear explanation of the exceptional behavior exhibited by the second Veronese embedding in characteristic $3$. Additionally, we show that for a general complete intersection of quadrics $X \subset \mathbb{P}^r$ of dimension at least $3$, the rank index of $(X,\mathcal{O}_X (2))$ is $4$, thereby confirming the optimality of our main bound. These results complete the classification of the rank index for Veronese embeddings when ${\rm char}(\mathbb{K}) \ne 2$.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. The elliptic GW invariants are computed using the elliptic virtual structure constants proposed in our previous works.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler compactification of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and Reeb dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex manifold. Assume that $Y\subset X$ is a K\"{a}hler submanifold such that $X\setminus Y$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove that $(X, Y)$ is biholomorphic to the standard example $(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathbb{P}^{n-1})$. We then study certain K\"{a}hler orbifold compactifications of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and, as an application, prove that on $\mathbb{C}^3$ the flat metric is the only asymptotically conical Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metric whose metric cone at infinity has a smooth link. As a key technical ingredient, we derive a new characterization of minimal discrepancy of isolated Fano cone singularities by using $S^1$-equivariant positive symplectic homology.</description>

      <title>The Cohen--Lenstra moments over function fields via the stable homology of non-splitting Hurwitz spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the homology of the Hurwitz space associated to an arbitrary finite rack stabilizes integrally in a suitable sense. We also compute the dominant part of its stable homology after inverting finitely many primes. This proves a conjecture of Ellenberg--Venkatesh--Westerland and improves upon our previous results for non-splitting racks. We obtain applications to Malle's conjecture, the Picard rank conjecture, and the Cohen--Lenstra--Martinet heuristics.</description>

      <title>Grassmann and Flag Varieties in Linear Algebra, Optimization, and Statistics: An Algebraic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassmann and flag varieties lead many lives in pure and applied mathematics. Here we focus on the algebraic complexity of solving various problems in linear algebra and statistics as optimization problems over these varieties. The measure of the algebraic complexity is the amount of complex critical points of the corresponding optimization problem. After an exposition of different realizations of these manifolds as algebraic varieties we present a sample of optimization problems over them and we compute their algebraic complexity.</description>

This extends work of Bhatt and Singh beyond the Calabi-Yau case. We also classify the (quasi)-$F$-purity of Fermat hypersurfaces.</description>
