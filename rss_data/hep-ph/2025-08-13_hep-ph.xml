      <title>ALPaca: The ALP Automatic Computing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALP Automatic Computing Algorithm, ALPaca, is an open source Python library devoted to studying the phenomenology of Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) with masses in the ranges $m_a \in [0.01 - 10]$ GeV. ALPaca provides a flexible and comprehensive framework to define ALP couplings at arbitrary energy scales, perform Renormalisation Group evolution and matching down to the desired low energy scale, and compute a large variety of ALP observables, with particular care to the meson decay sector. The package includes support for UV completions, experimental constraints, and visualisation tools, enabling both detailed analyses and broad parameter space exploration.</description>

      <title>Super-heated first order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first order phase transitions that occur when the temperature of the system increases and we identify the conditions that lead to super-heating, a phase where the system can heat up arbitrarily. First order phase transitions with super-heating behave as inverse transitions. We quantify these claims by studying a prototypical example of a dark sector with a large number of interacting light bosons at finite temperature. Depending upon thermalisation, a super-heated phase transition in cosmology is often associated with another transition when the system is eventually cooling down, enriching the spectrum of gravitational waves from bubble collisions.</description>

      <title>Radio Killed the Axion Star: Constraining Axion Properties with Radio Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion dark matter or any ultralight bosonic dark matter can go through Bose-Einstein condensation due to the large phase density, leading to the formation of axion stars or solitons in dark matter halo centers. The formation rate is enhanced in the presence of the substructures expected in the post-inflationary scenario for the QCD axion or axion-like particles. An axion star will continue to grow until a critical mass is reached, after which it collapses and then explodes, with the emission of relativistic axions, in a process called an ``axinovae.'' There can also be accompanying photon emission due to the stimulated decay of axions in the coherent compact axion star. In axion models with a modest enhancement ($\kappa\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$) of the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}= \kappa \alpha/(2\pi f_a)$ axinovae will contain a significant flux of radio photons. We determine the range of parameters over which axinovae can be detectable with radio transient searches.</description>

      <title>Precision calculation of $N_{\text{eff}}$ with Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach ($\nu$DSMC) is a method of solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the Early Universe, proposed to study the evolution of neutrinos under various cosmological setups. We formulate a complete $\nu$DSMC solver, incorporating the effects of the electron mass, neutrino oscillations, and quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic plasma. We then apply it for performing precise calculations of neutrino decoupling in the standard cosmological scenario. We obtain the value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.0439\pm 0.0006$, in agreement with the state-of-the-art calculations.</description>

      <title>Sweeping the pion chimney for axion-like particles with KOTO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that novel limits on prompt axion-like particles (ALPs) in the hard-to-probe mass range near the neutral pion - the so-called pion chimney - may be obtained from recasting $K_L \to 3\pi^0 \to 6\gamma$ KOTO data to search for $K_L \to 2\pi^0 a \to 6\gamma$. We also explore the power of KOTO $6\gamma$ data to probe $K_L \to 2\pi^0a$ for a broader range of ALP masses, incorporating displaced decays.</description>

      <title>Nucleon energy correlators as a probe of light-quark dipole operators at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose nucleon energy correlators (NECs) as a novel framework to probe electroweak light-quark dipole operators in deep inelastic scattering with an unpolarized nucleon. These operators encode chirality-flipping interactions, whose effects are usually quadratically suppressed in unpolarized cross sections. We construct a chiral-odd quark NEC that accesses quark transverse spin via azimuthal angle asymmetries in the energy flow of the target fragmentation region. These asymmetries serve as clean and powerful observables, enabling linear constraints on the quark dipole couplings. Unlike existing methods, our approach requires neither polarized nucleon beams nor final-state hadron identification, relying instead on fully inclusive calorimetric measurements. This work establishes one of the first applications of energy correlator observables to new physics searches and opens a promising direction for precision studies of chirality-flipping effects at electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Baryon and Pseudoscalar Meson Octets within a Unified broken SU(6) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I discuss neutron stars with hyperons and anti-kaon condensate. To fix their coupling constants with the vector mesons of the Quantum Hadrodynamics, I use a unified scheme imposing that the Yukawa coupling is an invariant under SU(3) and SU(6) groups. Combining with the G-Parity, I show that some expected results of the kaon and anti-kaon interaction with the nucleus are re-obtained. In the same sense, the naive quark-isospin counting rule is restored in the SU(6) limit. Furthermore, the G-Parity combined with the SU(3) gives us a clear picture of the role played by each meson in the kaon condensation. Numerical results show that the presence of anti-kaons severely compromises the stiffening of the EOS by breaking the SU(6) symmetry.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter within the dark photon portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the dark photon as a portal connecting to the dark sector in the case of Dirac fermion and complex scalar dark matter with masses up to 1 TeV. Both the dark photon and the $Z$ boson contribute to the dark matter annihilation and dark matter--nucleon scattering processes. We derive the lower limits on the dark parameters from thermal relic density. The corresponding spin-independent dark matter--proton cross sections are compared with the upper bounds set by direct detection. We explore the allowed regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with these constraints.</description>

      <title>Production of $J/\psi p \bar p$ in electron-positron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discoveries of the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquarks by the LHCb Collaboration have been not confirmed by other experiments yet. It is desirable to investigate the feasibility of observing them in other experiments. We present an order-of-magnitude estimate of the cross section of the $e^+e^-\to J/\psi p \bar p$ process, where the hidden-charm pentaquarks may be searched for, and find it to be of $\mathcal{O}(4~\text{fb})$ when the $e^+e^-$ c.m. energy is around 6 GeV. The cross section for $e^+e^-\to P_c \bar p$ is then estimated to be $\lesssim \mathcal{O}(0.1~\text{pb})$. Thus, it is promising to search for $P_c$ at the future high-luminosity super tau-charm facilities with annual integrated luminosity about $1~ab^{-1}$. We also predict the branching fraction of $\Upsilon\to J/\psi p\bar p$ to be of $\mathcal{O}(2\times 10^{-6})$, which can be tested at $B$ factories.</description>

      <title>Detecting Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter at MeV Gamma-Ray Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the indirect detection of sterile neutrino dark matter within the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, in which three right-handed neutrinos account for neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry, and dark matter. Focusing on the MeV mass range, we investigate two decay channels: the radiative decay $N \to \nu \gamma$, which produces a monochromatic photon, and the three-body decay $N \to e^- e^+ \nu$, which leads to a 511 keV photon signal from positronium decay. Taking the upcoming COSI mission as a case study, we show that both signals are experimentally accessible and complementary, with the 511 keV channel extending the sensitivity reach up to $O(100)$ MeV. We propose a novel analysis strategy in Compton data space to isolate the diffuse 511 keV emission. Furthermore, we incorporate, for the first time, the Sommerfeld enhancement in the decay width of $N \to e^- e^+ \nu$, enabling more accurate predictions of the signal near the kinematic threshold. The combined observation of both channels would provide a distinctive and testable signature of the sterile neutrino dark matter hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The spectral reconstruction problem for thermal photon and dilepton rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal photon and dilepton rates are important probes for understanding the quark-gluon plasma and QCD at high temperatures. As a consequence there is a strong interest to determine them using lattice QCD calculations. However, this is made difficult as they are related to thermal spectral functions that are not directly accessible through lattice calculations. Instead they are indirectly obtainable through performing an inverse Laplace-type transformation of Euclidean time lattice correlation functions. In this talk we will present recent results in dynamical QCD with a focus on advancements in determining the photon production rate via spectral reconstruction from lattice data.</description>

      <title>Bjorken initial energy density estimation in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV using ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bjorken initial energy density ($\epsilon_{B}$) has been estimated in different centrality classes in Xe-Xe collisions using Bjorken formula. Three different cases have been considered. In Case I, we have fixed the formation time ($\tau_{0}$) and varied the area of overlap region ($A_{overlap}$). In Case II, we have fixed both $\tau_{0}$ and $A_{overlap}$ and we have varied both $\tau_{0}$ and $A_{overlap}$ in Case III. We observed that the $\epsilon_{B}$ is first increasing and then decreasing while going from central to peripheral collisions in Case I whereas it is decreasing in Case II and III, as expected. The $\epsilon_{B}$ value for top central and mid central collisions in Case II and for all centrality classes in Case III are greater than 1 $GeV/(fm)^{3}$, indicating the possibility of QGP medium formation respectively. The $\epsilon_{B}$ results of the Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ and 5.02 TeV are compared. In Case II, it is observed that in the centrality class (0-5)%, the $\epsilon_{B}$ value in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 34.66% less than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 57.12% less than at 5.02 TeV. This may be interpreted as, the system size in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 34.66% smaller than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 57.12% smaller than at 5.02 TeV. Similarly in Case III in the centrality class (0-5)%, the $\epsilon_{B}$ value in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 3.22% more than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 32.18% less than at 5.02 TeV. This may be interpreted as, the system size in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 3.22% bigger than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 32.18% smaller than at 5.02 TeV. The results obtained in the Case III seems more suitable than Case II.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of Higgs-Gauge Boson couplings at the future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed $e^+e^-$ collider offers an ideal environment for precise estimation of Higgs boson properties which are of utmost importance to validate the Standard Model of particle physics. We investigate $hVV$ couplings, where $V\in \{Z,\gamma\}$ with single Higgs production associated with $Z$ boson at the proposed $e^+e^-$ machine with $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV, within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We employ the recoil mass of the dilepton system, to select the signal phase space, i.e, $Zh \to l^+ l^- b \bar{b}$ events. The constraints on the Wilson coefficients (WCs) are obtained using the optimal observable technique (OOT). On comparison with the current experimental limits at $68\%$ CL with $138$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity, our limits are tighter by a factor ranging from $1.5-10$ for CP even operators, while CP-odd WCs shows comparable limits.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of $W$-boson measurements to low-mass right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-mass right-handed neutrino could interact with electroweak bosons via mixing, a mediator particle, or loop corrections. Using an effective field theory, we determine constraints on these interactions from $W$-boson measurements at hadron colliders. Due to the difference in the initial states at the Tevatron and the LHC, $W$-boson decays to a right-handed neutrino would artificially increase the mass measured at the Tevatron while only affecting the difference between $W^+$ and $W^-$ mass measurements at the LHC. Measurements from CDF and the LHC are used to infer the corresponding parameter values, which are found to be inconsistent between the two. The LHC experiments can improve sensitivity to these interactions by measuring the cosine of the helicity angle using $W$ bosons produced with transverse momentum above $\approx 50$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Q-Balls and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for the cosmological formation of superheavy Q-Balls in the mass range $10^{-7} \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{6} \, M_{\odot}$. The model is based on a hidden sector scalar potential motivated by broken scale invariance, for which analytic Q-ball solutions and numerical simulations of condensate fragmentation exist. We show that this potential can produce superheavy Q-balls during the radiation-dominated era. As an example, we show that it is possible to produce Q-balls of mass $ \sim \,10^{6} \, M_{\odot}$ and diameter $\sim$ 100 light years, with a number density $\sim 1$ per galaxy. Such early-forming superheavy Q-balls could play a role in galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation. We also show that it is possible to form smaller mass Q-balls with large numbers per galaxy volume, that could form SMBH by merging. Finally, we show that it is possible to produce asteroid mass Q-balls that could account for all of the dark matter whilst remaining consistent with observational limits on MACHOs.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive analysis of Drell-Yan production uncertainties and mass effects at moderate and low dilepton masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of the sources of uncertainties to the Drell-Yan production using state-of-the-art predictions for both neutral and charged current channels, focusing on the low invariant mass region. Differential predictions for the invariant mass spectrum are provided at N$^3$LO supplemented with exact charm and bottom quark mass effects calculated at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. The impact of PDF choices (including approximate N$^3$LO), scale variations, the variation of the strong coupling constant, and impact heavy quark mass effects on the distributions is studied in detail. We also comment on the correlation of high-energy astrophysical processes with the low-mass DY region.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in a QCD medium with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium using a newly proposed collision kernel that consistently incorporates the particle's momentum dependence into the relaxation time scale of the medium. The longitudinal component of the gluon self-energy, along with the Debye screening mass, is computed within the one-loop hard thermal loop framework by incorporating non-equilibrium corrections. A modified kinetic theory with an extended relaxation time approximation is employed to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of the QCD medium. The sensitivity of the heavy quarkonia potential to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is studied. Further, we studied the binding energy and thermal width of quarkonia states within this new kinetic theory. Sizable variations in the temperature behavior of these quantities are observed in comparison with the standard relaxation time approximation method due to the particle momentum dependence on the relaxation timescale of the QCD medium. Our findings highlight that accounting for the microscopic nature of the collision timescale is crucial for understanding the quarkonium behavior in a QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing Radiative Decays of Neutrinos and Dark Matter Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel strategy for detecting the radiative decay of very weakly interacting particles by leveraging the extreme sensitivity of quantum devices, such as superconducting transmon qubits and trapped ion systems, to faint electromagnetic signals. By modeling the effective electric field induced by the decay photons, we evaluate the response of quantum sensors across two particle physics scenarios: the cosmic neutrino background and two-component dark matter. We assess the discovery potential of these devices and outline the parameter space accessible under current experimental capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum sensors can probe radiative decays of dark matter candidates using existing technology, while probing neutrino magnetic moments beyond current limits will require scalable quantum architectures with enhanced coherence.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We summarize the latest correlation and fluctuation measurements derived from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan-II (BES-II) data, collected by the STAR experiment. We will focus on the recent results of higher-order net-proton cumulants ($C_{1}-C_{4}$) in the energy range of 7.7 to 27 GeV Au+Au collisions.

      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have introduced a new Fourier-expansion technique for computing gravitational-wave emission from non-spinning binaries in the post-Newtonian framework. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, applying the method to the tail contribution of the energy flux, we found that it can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diquarks are often invoked as QCD effective degrees of freedom to describe baryons as well as certain exotic hadrons in phenomenology. However, even though they are successful in describing many of these low lying QCD states, they and their properties have been difficult to pin down. Here we present progress in studying diquarks in a gauge-invariant setup through embedding them in a parent hadron containing a heavy spectator quark using lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Super-Heavy Dark Matter with the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event, KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our Universe.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Curvature as a Probe of Exotic Core Phases in Neutron Stars within Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) on the curvature of neutron stars (NSs) by using three relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) and three hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) EOSs. Neutron stars, with their extreme densities and strong gravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for testing General Relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime and for exploring possible deviations via modified gravity. EMSG extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor, characterized by a coupling parameter $\alpha$. We focus on the Kretschmann, Ricci, and Weyl curvature scalars, analyzing their dependence on baryon density and radial coordinate for varying values of $\alpha$. Our results indicate that EMSG can significantly alter the curvature profiles of neutron stars. In particular, the magnitude of both Weyl and Kretschmann scalars increases (decreases) for a positive (negative) EMSG parameter, with the former exhibiting a larger dependence. Similarly, the surface curvature (SC) is notably affected by $\alpha$. Interestingly, we further observe distinct discontinuities in the curvature profiles at hadron-quark phase transitions, especially in the soft and intermediate HQPT models. These signatures may provide observable imprints of exotic core phases in neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: The detection by the Carpet-3 Group of a 300 TeV photon, observed 4536 seconds after the prompt emission of the historic gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, provides unprecedented opportunities to test Lorentz invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime. By analyzing the temporal and spatial properties of this ultra-high-energy photon in conjunction with lower-energy photons from other bursts and the same burst, we demonstrate consistency with subluminal LV scenarios characterized by an energy scale \( E_{\rm LV} \sim 3 \times 10^{17} \, \rm{GeV} \). This work bridges multi-year LV studies using GeV-TeV photons and establishes GRB 221009A as a pivotal laboratory for quantum spacetime phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the varying electron mass and early dark energy in light of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 and the implications for inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} &lt; 0.016$. Since those cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two Higgs doublets respect a mirror symmetry with spontaneous violation so that their vacuum expectation values can realize a small difference. Under this symmetry, three newly introduced right-handed neutrinos rather than the standard model fermions perform an odd transformation. Accordingly the neutrino masses and the charged fermion masses respectively are proportional to the difference and sum of the vacuum expectation values of two Higgs doublets. From a phenomenological perspective, such nearly degenerate Higgs doublets with large cancellation are equivalent to a Dirac seesaw mechanism with high suppression.</description>

      <title>Determination of quark and lepton masses and mixings in the microscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, formulas for the mixing matrices of quarks and leptons have been put forward. My contribution here describes the relevant foundational and technical aspects which have led to those results. The work has been carried out in the framework of the microscopic model. The most general ansatz for the interactions among tetrons leads to a Hamiltonian H involving Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian provides for 24 eigenvalues which are identified as the quark and lepton masses. While the masses of the third and second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of isospin interactions, light family masses are related to torsional interactions among tetrons. Neutrino masses turn out to be special in that they are given in terms of tiny isospin non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings. The approach not only leads to masses, but also allows to calculate the quark and lepton eigenstates, an issue, which is important for the determination of the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. The almost exact isospin conservation of the system dictates the form of the lepton states and makes them independent of all the couplings in H. Much in contrast, there is a strong dependence of the quark states on the coupling strengths, and a promising hierarchy between the quark family mixings shows up.</description>

Abstract: We point out that dark matter can illuminate planetary skies via ultraviolet airglow. Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which then deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. We search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data from Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that future ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds provide a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the first-order electroweak phase transition in the background of a hypermagnetic field with three-dimensional lattice simulation. The generation of baryon asymmetry is observed, and we present the relationship between baryon number asymmetry and magnetic field strength and its helicity. We find the magnetic field strength required to achieve the correct matter-antimatter asymmetry is about $10^{-17}\sim10^{-14}$ Gauss at present, depending on the correlation length of the helical magnetic field. This study provides a mechanism for explaining the baryon number asymmetry with cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Employing a unified Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter equations approach, we calculate the strong decay couplings $D^* D \pi$ and $B^* B \pi$ within the so-called impulse-approximation in the moving frame. The $B^* B \pi$ estimation is reported for the first time based on a Poincar\'e invariant computation of the associated Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Our predictions yield $g_{D^* D \pi}=16.22_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ and $g_{B^* B \pi}=40.09_{-1.37}^{+1.51}$, along with corresponding static strong couplings of $\hat{g}_D=0.55_{-&lt;0.01}^{+&lt;0.01}$, $\hat{g}_B=0.50_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$, which are consistent with recent experimental and lattice data.</description>

      <title>Exploring $Z'$ and Right-Handed Neutrinos in the BLSM at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collider phenomenology of the $B$-$L$ extension of the Standard Model (BLSM), focusing on the production and decay of a heavy neutral gauge boson (\( Z' \)) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this framework, the \( Z' \) can decay into pairs of heavy right-handed neutrinos (\( \nu_R \)), which subsequently decay into charged leptons and \( W \) bosons. These processes give rise to three distinctive final states: (i) two leptons plus four jets (\( 2\ell + 4j \)), (ii) four leptons plus missing transverse energy (\( 4\ell + \text{MET} \)), and (iii) three leptons plus two jets and MET (\( 3\ell + 2j + \text{MET} \)). %
To enhance signal sensitivity and suppress Standard Model backgrounds, we employ multivariate analysis techniques based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs), as well as selection optimizations using the \texttt{XGBOOST} framework. The classifiers are trained on kinematic observables sensitive to the masses of the \( Z' \) and \( \nu_R \). We demonstrate that all three final states offer significant discovery potential for both the \( Z' \) and heavy \( \nu_R \) at the High-Luminosity LHC. Our results highlight the testability of the BLSM at current and future collider experiments, and provide a promising avenue for probing the origin of neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $B_{c}^-\to J/\psi (\eta_c) L^-$ decays within the SM and beyond in QCD factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the deviations observed between the data and the SM predictions of $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}_s^0\to D_s^+ \pi^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}_d^0\to D^+ K^-)$, we revisit the $B_{c}^{-}\to J/\psi(\eta_{c}) L^{-}$ decays, with $L=\pi, K^{(*)}, \rho$, both within the SM and beyond. Since these processes are also mediated by $b\to c \bar{u} d(s)$ transitions and hence dominated by the colour-allowed tree topology, the QCD factorization (QCDF) is expected to hold in the heavy-quark limit. Firstly, we update the SM predictions of these decays by including the nonfactorizable vertex corrections up to the NNLO in $\alpha_s$. It is found that, relative to the LO results, the branching ratios of these decays up to the NLO and NNLO corrections are always enhanced, with a relative amount given by $\delta_{\text{NLO}} = (\mathcal{B}^\text{NLO}-\mathcal{B}^\text{LO})/\mathcal{B}^\text{LO} \approx +6\%$ and $\delta_{\text{NNLO}} = (\mathcal{B}^\text{NNLO}-\mathcal{B}^\text{LO})/\mathcal{B}^\text{LO} \approx +9\%$, respectively. To minimize the uncertainties brought by $V_{cb}$ and the transition form factors, we construct the ratios $R_{J/\psi(\eta_{c}) L}$, $R_{(s)L}^{(\ast)}$, and $R_{\pi/\mu\nu_{\mu}}$, which are then used to constrain the model-independent new physics (NP) Wilson coefficients. After considering the latest Belle data and the updated $B_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ form factors, we find that the deviations can still be explained by the NP four-quark operators with $(1+\gamma_{5}) \otimes (1-\gamma_{5})$ and $(1+\gamma_{5}) \otimes (1+\gamma_{5})$ structures, while the solution with $\gamma^\mu (1+\gamma_{5}) \otimes \gamma_\mu (1-\gamma_{5})$ structure does not work anymore, under the combined constraints from $R_{(s)L}^{(\ast)}$ at the $2\sigma$ level. Furthermore, the ratio $R_{\pi/\mu\nu_{\mu}}$, once measured precisely, could provide complementary constraint.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>

Abstract: Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their connection with the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this work, we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit and express the extracted $M_1M_2$ GDAs in terms of meson distribution amplitudes that have been constrained by the previous experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF that violates the conservation law of EMT when the hadronic matrix element of the EMT operator is considered separately for each quark flavor. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs in the perturbative limit. In the future, the GDAs and the EMT FFs studied in this paper can be probed at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, and provides a promising approach for searching for exotic hybrid mesons in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by large $N$ noncommutative geometry as a model for quantum gravity. The model admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in our model. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on $- G M_1 M_2$ exactly the manner as in Newton gravity. To reproduce the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, we expect the inclusion of large $N$ corrections and quantum effects will be needed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kerr Black Hole from Matrix Theory of Quantum Gravity</title>

Abstract: Recently, a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by a large $N$ non-commutative coordinates is proposed as a model for quantum gravity [1]. In this paper, we construct Kerr black hole as a rotating noncommutative geometry solution of this theory. Due to rotation, the fuzzy sphere is deformed into a fuzzy ellipsoid, which matches exactly the outer horizon of the Kerr black hole in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Together with a half-filled Fermi sea, the fuzzy solution reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr black hole. These results provide support that the proposed quantum mechanics of quantum spaces as a model of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

      <title>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.</description>
