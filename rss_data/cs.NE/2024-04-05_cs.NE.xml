      <title>Discovering the Power of Artificial Cardiac Conduction System (ACCS): Harmony in Bio-inspired Metaheuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic called Artificial Cardiac Conduction System (ACCS) inspired by the human cardiac conduction system. The ACCS algorithm imitates the functional behaviour of the human heart that generates and sends signals to the heart muscle, initiating it to contract. Four nodes in the myocardium layer are participating in generating and controlling heart rate, such as the sinoatrial, atrioventricular, bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers. The mechanism of controlling the heart rate through these four nodes is implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 19 well-known mathematical test functions as it can determine the exploitation and exploration capability of the algorithm, and the results are verified by a comparative study with Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Deferential Evolution (DE), and Fast Evolutionary Programming (FEP). The results show that the ACCS algorithm can provide very competitive results compared to these well-known metaheuristics and other conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Driven Global Optimisation Framework for Analog Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-driven optimisation framework for analog circuit design in this paper. The primary objective is to determine the device sizes for the optimal performance of analog circuits for a given set of specifications. Our methodology entails employing machine learning models and spice simulations to direct the optimisation algorithm towards achieving the optimal design for analog circuits. Machine learning based global offline surrogate models, with the circuit design parameters as the input, are built in the design space for the analog circuits under study and is used to guide the optimisation algorithm, resulting in faster convergence and a reduced number of spice simulations. Multi-layer perceptron and random forest regressors are employed to predict the required design specifications of the analog circuit. Since the saturation condition of transistors is vital in the proper working of analog circuits, multi-layer perceptron classifiers are used to predict the saturation condition of each transistor in the circuit. The feasibility of the candidate solutions is verified using machine learning models before invoking spice simulations. We validate the proposed framework using three circuit topologies--a bandgap reference, a folded cascode operational amplifier, and a two-stage operational amplifier. The simulation results show better optimum values and lower standard deviations for fitness functions after convergence. Incorporating the machine learning-based predictions proposed in the optimisation method has resulted in the reduction of spice calls by 56%, 59%, and 83% when compared with standard approaches in the three test cases considered in the study.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Parameter Control Methods in Differential Evolution for Mixed-Integer Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential evolution (DE) generally requires parameter control methods (PCMs) for the scale factor and crossover rate. Although a better understanding of PCMs provides a useful clue to designing an efficient DE, their effectiveness is poorly understood in mixed-integer black-box optimization. In this context, this paper benchmarks PCMs in DE on the mixed-integer black-box optimization benchmarking function (bbob-mixint) suite in a component-wise manner. First, we demonstrate that the best PCM significantly depends on the combination of the mutation strategy and repair method. Although the PCM of SHADE is state-of-the-art for numerical black-box optimization, our results show its poor performance for mixed-integer black-box optimization. In contrast, our results show that some simple PCMs (e.g., the PCM of CoDE) perform the best in most cases. Then, we demonstrate that a DE with a suitable PCM performs significantly better than CMA-ES with integer handling for larger budgets of function evaluations. Finally, we show how the adaptation in the PCM of SHADE fails.</description>

      <title>A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.</description>

      <title>Embodied Neuromorphic Artificial Intelligence for Robotics: Perspectives, Challenges, and Research Development Stack</title>

Abstract: Robotic technologies have been an indispensable part for improving human productivity since they have been helping humans in completing diverse, complex, and intensive tasks in a fast yet accurate and efficient way. Therefore, robotic technologies have been deployed in a wide range of applications, ranging from personal to industrial use-cases. However, current robotic technologies and their computing paradigm still lack embodied intelligence to efficiently interact with operational environments, respond with correct/expected actions, and adapt to changes in the environments. Toward this, recent advances in neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have demonstrated the potential to enable the embodied intelligence for robotics through bio-plausible computing paradigm that mimics how the biological brain works, known as "neuromorphic artificial intelligence (AI)". However, the field of neuromorphic AI-based robotics is still at an early stage, therefore its development and deployment for solving real-world problems expose new challenges in different design aspects, such as accuracy, adaptability, efficiency, reliability, and security. To address these challenges, this paper will discuss how we can enable embodied neuromorphic AI for robotic systems through our perspectives: (P1) Embodied intelligence based on effective learning rule, training mechanism, and adaptability; (P2) Cross-layer optimizations for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing; (P3) Representative and fair benchmarks; (P4) Low-cost reliability and safety enhancements; (P5) Security and privacy for neuromorphic computing; and (P6) A synergistic development for energy-efficient and robust neuromorphic-based robotics. Furthermore, this paper identifies research challenges and opportunities, as well as elaborates our vision for future research development toward embodied neuromorphic AI for robotics.</description>

      <title>REACT: Revealing Evolutionary Action Consequence Trajectories for Interpretable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance the interpretability of Reinforcement Learning (RL), we propose Revealing Evolutionary Action Consequence Trajectories (REACT). In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</description>

      <title>BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing a set of functions simultaneously by leveraging their similarity is called multi-task optimization. Current black-box multi-task algorithms only solve a finite set of tasks, even when the tasks originate from a continuous space. In this paper, we introduce Parametric-Task MAP-Elites (PT-ME), a new black-box algorithm for continuous multi-task optimization problems. This algorithm (1) solves a new task at each iteration, effectively covering the continuous space, and (2) exploits a new variation operator based on local linear regression. The resulting dataset of solutions makes it possible to create a function that maps any task parameter to its optimal solution. We show that PT-ME outperforms all baselines, including the deep reinforcement learning algorithm PPO on two parametric-task toy problems and a robotic problem in simulation.</description>

      <title>SpikeNAS: A Fast Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search Framework for Spiking Neural Network-based Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile agents (e.g., UAVs and UGVs) are typically expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks (such as object recognition), as these mobile agents are usually powered by portable batteries. These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of the SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of autonomous mobile agents. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from autonomous mobile agents. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, and developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 4.4x faster search with 1.3% accuracy improvement for CIFAR100, using an Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained autonomous mobile agents.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Improving Accuracy of Embedded Spiking Neural Networks through Kernel Size Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can offer ultra low power/ energy consumption for machine learning-based applications due to their sparse spike-based operations. Currently, most of the SNN architectures need a significantly larger model size to achieve higher accuracy, which is not suitable for resource-constrained embedded applications. Therefore, developing SNNs that can achieve high accuracy with acceptable memory footprint is highly needed. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology that improves the accuracy of SNNs through kernel size scaling. Its key steps include investigating the impact of different kernel sizes on the accuracy, devising new sets of kernel sizes, generating SNN architectures based on the selected kernel sizes, and analyzing the accuracy-memory trade-offs for SNN model selection. The experimental results show that our methodology achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (93.24% accuracy for CIFAR10 and 70.84% accuracy for CIFAR100) with less than 10M parameters and up to 3.45x speed-up of searching time, thereby making it suitable for embedded applications.</description>
