      <title>Exactly solvable multicomponent spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By generalising the one to one correspondence between exactly solvable hermitian matrices $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^\dagger$ and exactly solvable spinless fermion systems $\mathcal{H}_f=\sum_{x,y}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}(x,y)c_y$, four types of exactly solvable multicomponent fermion systems are constructed explicitly. They are related to the multivariate Krawtcouk, Meixner and two types of Rahman like polynomials, constructed recently by myself. The Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are the eigenvectors of certain real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ which are related to the difference equations governing them. The corresponding fermions have nearest neighbour interactions. The Rahman like polynomials are eigenvectors of certain reversible Markov chain matrices $\mathcal{K}$, from which real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ are uniquely defined by the similarity transformation in terms of the square root of the stationary distribution. The fermions have wide range interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative refined topological string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formula for the full nonperturbative topological string free energy was recently proposed by Hattab and Palti \cite{HP24a}. In this work, we extend their result to the refined topological string theory. We demonstrate that the proposed formula for the full nonperturbative refined topological string free energy correctly reproduces the trans-series structure of the refined topological string and captures the Stokes automorphisms associated with its resurgent properties.</description>

      <title>From Modular Graph Forms to Iterated Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular graph forms are a class of non-holomorphic modular forms that arise in the low-energy expansion of genus-one closed string amplitudes. In this work, we introduce a systematic procedure to convert lattice-sum representations of modular graph forms into iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein series and provide a \textsc{Mathematica} package that implements all modular graph form topologies up to four vertices. To achieve this, we introduce specific tree-representations of modular graph forms. The presented method enables the conversion of the integrand of the four-graviton one-loop superstring amplitude at eighth order in the inverse string tension $\alpha^{\prime 8}$, which we use to calculate the $\alpha^{\prime 8}\zeta_3\zeta_5$ contribution to the analytic part of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmological cutting rules for Bogoliubov initial states: any mass and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological optical theorem and the cutting rules are well-known consequences of unitary time evolution in cosmology. The earlier works showed that assuming a Bunch-Davies initial state, one can derive equations relating a wavefunction diagram with a given number of internal lines to a sum of diagrams with fewer internal lines. In particular, it can relate a loop diagram to a sum of tree-level diagrams. Recently these relations were generalised to a set of excited initial states known as Bogoliubov states and they were shown to have non-trivial consequences for n-point contact and 4-point exchange diagrams. This analysis restricted the field content to massless and conformally coupled scalar fields. In this paper, we take the final step of generalising these "Bogoliubov cutting rules" to fields of any mass and spin. We define modified propagator identities and corresponding "Discontinuities" which automatically generalise the earlier relations to fields of any mass and spin. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the far past convergence of time integrals in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the information degradation in a massive Unruh-DeWitt theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of the massive scalar field on the information degradation concerning the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. In this conjecture, we adopted a system with a finite and large interaction time. To accomplish our purpose, one examines the quantum coherence of a uniformly accelerated qubit and the probability of finding the detector in the ground state. In this framework, we consider a quantum interferometric circuit to obtain the probability, visibility, and coherence. Naturally, these measurements provide us with wave-like information. Besides, one modifies the circuit to describe the path distinguishability and the particle-like information. These results are promising, as they allow us to understand the influence of the Unruh effect on the wave-particle duality. Thus, our findings announce that the increase in the scalar field mass induces a decrease in information degradation. Finally, we noted that the information concerning the Unruh effect remains preserved when $m \geq \Omega$. Therefore, the detector cannot absorb particles with mass equal to or greater than its energy gap. These results indicate that the scalar field mass is a protective factor against information degradation for systems under high acceleration conditions.</description>

      <title>Condensate phases of nuclear matter from AdS Hardwall models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops our previous study of confined phases at finite densities in AdS/QCD by systematically exploring the possibility of baryonic condensates. Using phenomenologically motivated boundary conditions in an AdS hardwall model, we show that both baryonic and quark type condensates dominate the phase diagram at low temperatures. We also undertake a careful scan of the parameter space to extract robust conclusions.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Tensor Coupling in Holographic Mean-Field Theory: Deformed Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the holographic mean-field theory to rank-two symmetric tensor order parameter field coupled with fermion. We classify the roles of symmetric tensor order according to the effect on the spectral density: cone-angle change, squashing, and tilting of the spectral light cones. In case of the over-tilted light cone, an analytic continuation of the Green's function is necessary to preserve the continuity of the spectrum inside the lightcone. Our results provide agreements between the holographic spectra with those observed in real materials, such as type-II Dirac cones and strained graphene.</description>

      <title>Wave-form, memory and classical soft scalar theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a scattering process in which a set of particles come together, interact through a long-range massless scalar force, and then disperse. We study the scalar wave-form, the scalar memory term, and classical soft scalar theorems. We derive an infinite series of subleading terms in the early- and late-time expansion of the wave-form, which depend only on the momenta and charges of the scattered particles. For two-body scattering, we obtain a resummed scalar wave-form in frequency space, as well as its resummed wave-form at early and late times. We compute the trajectories of the scattered particles, determine the trajectory coefficients, and apply the probe approximation to simplify the analysis. We then compute the scalar wave-form and extract the scalar memory term. We focus specifically on two-body scattering and employ the probe approximation to simplify the wave-form calculations. We ignore gravitational interactions and focus on the massless scalar force. We also discuss the main technical and conceptual challenges that arise when gravity is included.</description>

      <title>Transition between Schwarzschild black hole and string black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the quantum transition between a Schwarzschild black hole and a string black hole in the large $D$ limit. Classically, such a transition between these two distinct black hole geometries is forbidden. The only feasible discussion is centered on how a black hole evaporates, loses mass, and transitions into highly excited fundamental strings. Building upon our previous work on T-duality between the Schwarzschild and string black holes, we reduce the problem to two dimensions, where the corresponding Wheeler-De Witt equation can be derived. Using this equation, we identify the two black hole geometries as distinct wave function states. This allows us to easily compute the transition probability between these two geometries, driven by the string coupling.</description>

      <title>Instability of Baryonic Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic black branes describe the quantum critical phase of the conformal conifold gauge theory at strong coupling. This phase extends to zero temperature at a finite baryonic chemical potential, represented by extremal black branes with $AdS_2\times R^3\times T^{1,1}$ throat in asymptotic $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$ geometry. We demonstrate here that this phase is dynamically unstable below some critical value of $T_c/\mu$: the instability is represented by a diffusive mode in the hydrodynamic sound channel with a negative diffusion coefficient. We also identify a new (exotic) ordered phase of the conifold gauge theory: this phase originates at the same critical value of $T_c/\mu$, but extends to arbitrary high temperatures, and is characterized by an expectation value of a dimension-2 operator, ${\cal O}_2\propto T^2$, in the limit $\frac \mu T\to 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axially symmetric $U(1)$ gauged self-interacting Q-balls are shown to support normalizable fermionic bound state, minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field of the Q-ball. It is shown that the effects of the backreaction of the fermionic mode are very small. We explore the domain of existence of the solutions and address some of their physical properties. Among other properties, we observe that the eigenvalue of the Dirac operator remains positive, there is no zero mode in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <title>Mapping luminous and dark matter in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our standard model of the Universe predicts the distribution of dark matter to $1\%$ at the scales needed for upcoming experiments, yet our predictions for how the luminous matter -which has interactions besides gravity- is distributed remain highly uncertain. Understanding how much gas and stars there are in the Universe and where they preferentially live is challenging, and the uncertainty affects how well we can understand the cosmological model itself. For example, it compromises our ability to tell apart different models for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this Essay, I will touch upon many recent developments that suggest we will be able to overcome this limitation before data from new experiments become available. More excitingly, I will describe how our efforts to model luminous and dark matter jointly will create new possibilities for constraining the physics of supermassive black holes, galaxies, and gas over time.</description>

Abstract: We show that every twist of pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group GL(N) can be realized as an open-string field theory in topological string theory. Our approach reinterprets twists of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as generalized Chern-Simons theories, and identifies topological string backgrounds that produce the corresponding Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <title>The Toda-Weyl mass spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of affine Toda theories are known to correspond to the entries of a Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the relevant Cartan matrix. The Lagrangian of the theory can be expressed in terms of a suitable eigenvector of a Coxeter element in the Weyl group. We generalize this set-up by formulating Lagrangians based on eigenvectors of arbitrary elements in the Weyl group. Under some technical conditions (that hold for many Weyl group elements), we calculate the classical mass spectrum. In particular, we indicate the relation to the relative geometry of special roots, generalizing the affine Toda mass spectrum description in terms of the Cartan matrix. Related questions of three point coupling and integrability are left to be addressed on a future occasion.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes: Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time for Kerr black holes. For For initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Microwave Background: Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) traveled the cosmos long before it reached our telescopes today. Consequently, it is one of the best probes of fundamental processes in the early Universe that we could hope to observe. The cosmological information is encoded in two distinct ways. First, we can investigate how the CMB photons in one sky-direction are distributed across energy by focusing on information carried by the CMB frequency spectrum. Second, we can compare the flux of CMB photons that we receive from different directions, this time at a fixed frequency, to study the CMB anisotropies. In the past six decades since the serendipitous discovery of the CMB in 1965, cosmologists have advanced both frontiers in terms of theory and observation. In this chapter, I will give a broad-brush overview about how the CMB spectrum forms and evolves throughout cosmic history, mentioning CMB anisotropies only on the side. I will attempt to highlight some of the key theoretical ingredients that allowed us to establish the detailed picture of the Universe we have today. With this, I hope to convince you that, beyond the impressive past successes, the CMB still holds many treasures for us, and will keep generations of scientists busy for the decades to come.</description>

      <title>Formation of Singularity and Apparent Horizon for Dissipative Collapse in $f(R,T)$ Theory of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of isotropic matter undergoing dissipation in the form of heat flux, with a generalized Vaidya exterior, in the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity. Choosing $f(R, T)=R+2\lambda T$, and applying the $f(R, T)$ junction conditions on the field equations for the interior and exterior regions, we have obtained matching conditions of the matter-Lagrangian and its derivatives across the boundary. The time of formation of singularity and the time of formation of apparent horizon have been determined and constraints on the integration constants are examined for which the final singularity is hidden behind the horizon.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code &amp; Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of entangled states induced by noncommutative deformation of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the notion of quantum entanglement induced by the deformation of phase-space through noncommutative space (NC) parameters. The geometric structure of the state space for Gaussian states in NC-space is illustrated through information geometry approach. We parametrize the phase-space distributions by their covariances and utilize the Fisher-Rao metric to construct the statistical manifold associated with quantum states. We describe the notion of the Robertson-Scr\"{o}dinger uncertainty principle (RSUP) and positive partial transpose (PPT) conditions for allowed quantum states and separable states, respectively, for NC-space. RSUP and PPT provide the restrictions on all allowed states and separable states, respectively. This enables us to estimate the relative volumes of set of separable states and entangled states. Numerical estimations are provided for a toy model of a bipartite Gaussian state. We restrict our study to such bipartite Gaussian states, for which the entanglement is induced by the noncommutative phase-space parameters.</description>

      <title>Qubit Regurlarization of Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Thermodynamics and Generalised Non-Extensive Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of this work provides a review of recent research on generalised entropies and their origin, as well as its application to black hole thermodynamics. To start, it is shown that the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are, respectively, the only possible thermodynamical temperature and entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, it is investigated if the other known generalised entropies, which include R\'enyi's entropy, the Tsallis one, and the four- and five-parameter generalised entropies, could correctly yield the Hawking temperature and the ADM mass. The possibility that generalised entropies could describe hairy black hole thermodynamics is also considered, both for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole and for Einstein's gravity coupled with two scalar fields. Two possibilities are investigated, namely, the case when the ADM mass does not yield the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the case in which the effective mass expressing the energy inside the horizon does not yield the Hawking temperature. For the model with two scalar fields, the radii of the photon sphere and of the black hole shadow are calculated, which gives constraints on the BH parameters. These constraints are seen to be consistent, provided the black hole is of Schwarzschild type. Subsequently, the origin of the generalised entropies is investigated, by using their microscopic particle descriptions in the frameworks of a microcanonical and of a canonical ensemble, respectively. To finish, the McLaughlin expansion for the generalised entropies is used to derive, in each case, the microscopic interpretation of the generalised entropies, via the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles.</description>

Abstract: We propose a unified model for the three Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetries and $SU(3)$ family symmetry based on $SO(16)$ grand unified gauge symmetry on six-dimensional (6D) spacetime. In this model, three chiral generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a 6D Weyl fermion in the spinor representation of $SO(16)$. The 6D $SO(16)$ gauge anomaly is canceled by the vectorlike nature of the model, and the 4D gauge anomalies are canceled by introducing suitable 4D localized fermions at the fixed point. The gauge coupling constant of $SO(16)$ is asymptotically free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems in the sense that integration constants in the solutions, such as the parameter $m$ in the Schwarzschild metric, do not allow for an interpretation in terms of conserved quantities in the theory. The recently introduced Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity that inherits all the solutions of the latter, and defined with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources.</description>

      <title>The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the emission of radiation from general sources in quantum scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields using the Rindler coordinate frame, which is suitable for a uniformly accelerated observer, in the Minkowski vacuum. In particular, we point out that, to recover the usual Larmor radiation in the interaction picture, it is necessary to incorporate the Unruh effect. Thus, the observation of classical Larmor radiation could be seen as vindicating the Unruh effect in the sense that it is not correctly reproduced in this context unless the Unruh effect is taken into account.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Pontryagin trace anomaly for chiral fermions in a general curved background using Pauli-Villars regularization. We use both Feynman diagram method and Fujikawa's method to calculate the parity-odd contribution (Pontryagin term). Our result indicates that the trace anomaly of energy-momentum tensor for chiral fermions has Pontryagin term $P=\frac{i}{1536\pi^2}\epsilon_{\nu\sigma\kappa\lambda}R^{\nu\sigma}_{\ \ \rho\mu}R^{\rho\mu\kappa\lambda}$ which agrees with the work of Bonora et al \cite{Bonora:2014qla}.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of the symplectic sp(2N) algebra deformed using Dunkl operators, which describe the dynamical symmetry of the generalized N-particle quantum Calogero model. It contains a symmetry subalgebra formed by the deformed unitary generators as well as the (nondeformed) sl(2,R) conformal subalgebra. An explicit relation among the deformed symplectic generators is derived. Based on the matching between the Casimir elements of the conformal spin and Dunkl angular momentum algebras, the independent wavefunctions of the both the standard and generalized Calogero models, expressed in terms of the deformed spherical harmonics, are classified according to infinite-dimensional lowest-state sl(2,R) multiplets. Meanwhile, any polynomial integral of motion of the (generalized) Calogero-Moser model generates a finite-dimensional highest-state conformal multiplet with descendants expressed via the Weyl-ordered product in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the vacuum entanglement entropy across a cut of future null infinity for free Maxwell theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The Weyl invariance of 4D Maxwell theory allows us to embed the Minkowski spacetime inside the Einstein static universe. The Minkowski vacuum can then be described as a thermofield double state on the (future) Milne wedges of the original and inverted Minkowski patches. We show that the soft mode contribution to entanglement entropy is due to correlations between asymptotic charges of these Milne wedges or, equivalently, nontrivial conformally soft (or edge) mode configurations at the entangling surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the boundary dual of AdS3xS3xK3 for NS5-flux Q5=1, which is described by a sigma model with target space given by the d-fold symmetric product of K3. Building on results in algebraic geometry, we address the problem of deforming it away from the orbifold point from the viewpoint of topological strings. We propose how the 't Hooft expansion can be geometrized in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants and, in favorable settings, how it can be summed up to all orders in closed form. We consider an explicit example in detail for which we discuss the genus expansion around the orbifold point, as well as the divergence in the strong coupling regime. We find that within the domain of convergence, scale separation does not occur. However, in order for the mathematical framework to be applicable in the first place, we need to consider "reduced" Gromov-Witten invariants that fit, as we argue, naturally to topologically twisted N=4 strings. There are some caveats and thus to what extent this toy model captures the physics of strings on AdS3xS3xK3 remains to be seen.</description>

Abstract: We propose a systematic approximation scheme to calculate general $n$-point $HSSA$ of open bosonic string theory. This stringy scaling loop expansion contains finite number of vacuum diagram terms at each loop order of scattering energy due to a vacuum diagram contraint and a topological graph constraint. In addition, we calculate coefficient and give the vacuum diagram representation and its Feynman rules for each term in the expansion of the $HSSA$. As an application to extending our previous calculation of $n$-point leading order stringy scaling behavior of $HSSA$, we explicitly calculate some examples of $4$-point next to leading order stringy scaling violation terms.</description>

      <title>RG Interfaces from Double-Trace Deformations</title>

Abstract: We study a class of interface conformal field theories obtained by taking a large $N$ CFT and turning on a relevant double-trace deformation over half space. At low energies, this leads to a conformal interface separating two CFTs which are related by RG flow. We set up the large $N$ expansion of these models by employing a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation over half space, and use this approach to compute some of the defect CFT data. We also calculate the free energy of the theory in the case of spherical interface, which encodes a conformal anomaly coefficient for even dimensional interface, and the analog of the $g$-function for odd-dimensional interface. These models have a dual description in terms of a gravitational theory in AdS where a bulk scalar field satisfies different boundary conditions on each half of the AdS boundary. We review this construction and show that the results of the large $N$ expansion on the CFT side are in precise agreement with the holographic predictions.</description>

      <title>Stability of multibrane models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multibrane 5-dimensional models with a warped extra spatial dimension compactified on an $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold are investigated. The Goldberger-Wise field, with appropriate bulk and brane potentials, is utilized to fix the brane positions. However, not all configurations with fixed brane positions are stable. Stability against small scalar perturbations of the metric and the Goldberger-Wise field was so far analyzed only for 2-brane models. Generalization of such analysis for multibrane models is the main subject of the present work. Stability of brane configurations is closely related to the spectrum of radions: namely, the existence of any tachyonic radion indicates instability, while models with positive squared masses for all radions are stable. The necessary and sufficient conditions for each of these possibilities are derived for multibrane models and constitute the main result of this paper. Additionally, some properties of radions, particularly their relation to distances between and along branes, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heterotic string theories in nine and eight dimensions. We identify the disconnected part of the spacetime gauge group by studying the outer automorphism of the charge lattices. The absence of the global symmetry indicates the existence of non-supersymmetric codimension two branes. Moreover, we provide a list of gauge groups and matter contents of non-supersymmetric rank-reduced heterotic string theories (a branch corresponding to the $E_8$ string on $S^1$) from the orbifolding of the outer automorphism as well as the fermion parity. We also provide examples in eight dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the complex Liouville string, a solvable string theory defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex conjugate central charges $c \in 13+i \mathbb{R}$ on the worldsheet. We compute its amplitudes from first principles and establish a duality with a double-scaled two-matrix integral. We also analyze general worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects in the genus expansion. This theory is capable of capturing aspects of de Sitter quantum gravity in both two and three dimensions, which leads to a precise version of de Sitter holography.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: the worldsheet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-dimensional string theory defined by coupling two copies of Liouville CFT with complex central charge $c=13\pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. This string theory defines a novel, consistent and controllable model of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We use the exact solution of the worldsheet theory to derive stringent constraints on the analytic structure of the string amplitudes as a function of the vertex operator momenta. Together with other worldsheet constraints, this allows us to completely pin down the string amplitudes without explicitly computing the moduli space integrals. We focus on the case of the sphere four-point amplitude and torus one-point amplitude as worked examples. This is the first in a series of papers on the complex Liouville string: three subsequent papers will elucidate the holographic duality with a two-matrix integral, discuss worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects, and connect the theory to de Sitter quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>A Note on Seiberg Duality for $N_{f} &lt; N_{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider SQCD for $N_{f}&lt;N_{c}$. We use a brane configuration in type IIA string theory to propose a Seiberg dual. The brane configuration that realises the magnetic theory contains $N_{f}$ branes and $N_{c}-N_{f}$ \textit{anti}-branes, leading to an $SU(N_{c}-N_{f})$ gauge theory with $N_{f}$ flavours. The potential between the branes triggers a RG flow and we argue that the IR theory realises the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential. We use both field theory arguments, in particular anomaly matching, and a lift of the type IIA brane configuration to M-theory, in order to support our proposal.</description>

      <title>The underlying black hole phase transitions in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a holographic critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model exhibits a first-order phase transition curve that terminates at a holographic critical endpoint, offering intriguing insights into the phase diagram of the dual system living on the boundary. However, the specific instability within the underlying spacetime that triggers the formation of the hairy black hole remains somewhat obscure. This raises the question of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a superconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into a indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the associated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by exploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model. The approach aims to provide transparent insights into the black hole phase transitions in the bulk. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between a massive real scalar field and a Maxwell field in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, we identify two types of scalarization corresponding to tachyonic instabilities in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. These distinct instabilities lead to a first-order phase transition between two phases in the $\mu-T$ phase diagram. Furthermore, this first-order transition terminates at a critical point, beyond which the curve turns back, and the transition becomes a numerically elusive third-order one. Although one does not encounter a critical endpoint, the model still offers a consistent interpretation for the observed {\it cross-over} in the low baryon density region. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the scalarized hairy black holes and discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a duality between the complex Liouville string and a two-matrix integral. The complex Liouville string is defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex central charges $c = 13 \pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. The matrix integral is characterized by its spectral curve which allows us to compute the perturbative string amplitudes recursively via topological recursion. This duality constitutes a controllable instance of holographic duality. The leverage on the theory is provided by the rich analytic structure of the string amplitudes that we discussed in arXiv:2409.18759 and allows us to perform numerous tests on the duality.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric AdS$_6$ black holes from ISO(3)xU(1) F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to four vector multiplets with $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a maximally supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacuum with $SO(3)\subset ISO(3)$ symmetry. We find a number of new supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ solutions by performing topological twists along $\mathcal{M}_4$. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a product of two Riemann surfaces $\Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$, we perform a twist by $SO(2)\times U(1)$ gauge fields and find $AdS_2\times \Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$ solutions for at least one of the Riemann surface being negatively curved. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a Kahler four-cycle $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}$, a twist by $SO(2)\times U(1)$ gauge fields leads to $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}^-$ solutions for negatively curved $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}$. Finally, performing a twist by turning on $SO(3)$ gauge fields in the case of $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a Cayley four-cycle $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}$ also leads to $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}^-$ solutions for negatively curved $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}$. We give numerical black hole solutions interpolating between all of these $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ near horizon geometries and the asymptotically locally $AdS_6$ vacuum. It is also possible to uplift all of these solutions to type IIB theory via consistent truncations on $S^2\times \Sigma$ leading to a new class of supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4\times S^2\times \Sigma$ solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate general observables of the complex Liouville string with worldsheet boundaries. We develop a universal formalism that reduces such observables to ordinary closed string amplitudes without boundaries, applicable to any worldsheet string theory, but particularly simple in the context of 2d or minimal string theories. We apply this formalism to the duality of the complex Liouville string with the matrix integral proposed in arXiv:2409.18759 and arXiv:2410.07345 and showcase the formalism by finding appropriate boundary conditions for various matrix model quantities of interest, such as the resolvent or the partition function. We also apply this formalism towards the computation of non-perturbative effects on the worldsheet mediated by ZZ-instantons. These are known to be plagued by extra subtleties which need input from string field theory to resolve. These computations probe and uncover the duality between the complex Liouville string and the matrix model at the non-perturbative level.</description>

      <title>The Cusp Limit of Correlators and A New Graphical Bootstrap for Correlators/Amplitudes to Eleven Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the universal behavior of half-BPS correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills in the cusp limit where two consecutive separations $x_{12}^2,x_{23}^2$ become lightlike. Through the Lagrangian insertion procedure, the Sudakov double-logarithmic divergence of the $n$-point correlator is related to the $(n+1)$-point correlator where the inserted Lagrangian "pinches" to the soft-collinear region of the cusp. We formulate this constraint as a new graphical rule for the $f$-graphs of the four-point correlator, which turns out to be the most constraining rule known so far. By exploiting this single graphical rule, we bootstrap the planar integrand of the four-point correlator up to ten loops ($n=14$) and fix all 22024902 but one coefficient at eleven loops ($n=15$); the remaining coefficient is then fixed using the triangle rule. We comment on the breakdown of a "Catalan conjecture" for the coefficients of the family of $f$-graphs known as "anti-prisms" where the coefficient of the twelve-loop ($n=16$) anti-prism is found to be $-38$ (as opposed to $-42$ if the conjecture should hold) by a local analysis of the bootstrap equations. We also comment on the implication of our graphical rule for the non-planar contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realize an explicit conformal mapping between the state and operator pictures in a class of (2+1)-dimensional non-Lorentzian field theories with SU(1,2)$\times$U(1) conformal symmetry. The state picture arises from null reducing four-dimensional relativistic conformal field theories on a three-sphere, yielding a non-Lorentzian geometry with the conformal Killing symmetry group SU(1,2). This is complementary to the operator picture recently studied by Lambert et al., where the geometry acquires an $\Omega$-deformation. We then use the geometric mapping between the two pictures to derive a correspondence between the generators. This provides a concrete realization of the state-operator correspondence in non-Lorentzian conformal field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

      <title>Correlation hypergraph: a new representation of a quantum marginal independence pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the quantum marginal independence problem, namely the question of which faces of the subadditivity cone are achievable by quantum states. We introduce a new representation of the patterns of marginal independence (PMIs, corresponding to faces of the subadditivity cone) based on certain correlation hypergraphs, and demonstrate that this representation provides a more efficient description of a PMI, and consequently of the set of PMIs which are compatible with strong subadditivity. We then show that these correlation hypergraphs generalize to arbitrary quantum systems the well known relation between positivity of mutual information and connectivity of entanglement wedges in holography, and further use this representation to derive new results about the combinatorial structure of collections of simultaneously decorrelated subsystems specifying SSA-compatible PMIs. In the context of holography, we apply these techniques to derive a necessary condition for the realizability of entropy vectors by simple tree graph models, which were conjectured in arXiv:2204.00075 to provide the building blocks of the holographic entropy cone. Since this necessary condition is formulated in terms of chordality of a certain graph, it can be tested efficiently.</description>

      <title>Geometry and symmetries of Hermitian-Einstein and instanton connection moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ of Hermitian-Einstein irreducible connections on a vector bundle $E$ over a K\"ahler with torsion (KT) manifold $M^{2n}$ that admits holomorphic $\h\nabla$-covariantly constant vector fields, where $\h\nabla$ is the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$. We demonstrate that such vector fields induce an action on $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ that leaves both the metric and complex structure invariant. Moreover, if an additional condition is satisfied, the induced vector fields are convariantly constant with respect to the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $\h{\mathcal{ D}}$ on $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$. We demonstrate that in the presence of such vector fields, the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ can be modeled on that of holomorphic toric principal bundles with base space KT manifolds and give some examples.
  We also extend our analysis to the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{\asd}^*(M^{4})$ of instanton connections on vector bundles over KT, bi-KT (generalised K\"ahler) and hyper-K\"ahler with torsion (HKT) manifolds $M^4$. We find that the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{\asd}^*(S^3\times S^1)$ can be modeled on that of principal bundles with fibre $S^3\times S^1$ over Quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds with torsion (QKT). In addition motivated by applications to AdS/CFT, we explore the (superconformal) symmetry algebras of two-dimensional sigma models with target spaces such moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Running EFT-hedron with null constraints at loop level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implications of general properties of quantum field theory, such as causality, unitarity, and locality include constraints on the couplings of the effective field theory (EFT) coefficients. These constraints follow from the connections between the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) theory imposed by dispersion relations for four-particle amplitudes which formally allow us to express EFT couplings through the moments of positive-definite functions (imaginary parts of partial wave amplitudes) forming the EFT-hedron geometry. Previous studies of these positivity bounds were mainly focused on the weakly coupled EFTs, limiting the analysis to tree-level amplitudes of the IR theory. In this work, we extend the scope of positivity bounds including one-loop amplitudes, which is essential especially for the loops of massless particles. Examining a single scalar theory we found that the presence of massless loops cannot be reduced only to the running of EFT couplings because loops modify the crossing symmetry relations (null constraints). Our results demonstrate that while for small coupling constants, the one-loop bounds are in good agreement with the tree-level results, the allowed EFT parameter ranges can be significantly modified if a weak coupling assumption is not additionally imposed. In particular, we found that an upper bound on dimension-8 coupling becomes significantly stronger, and the dimension-12 coupling can be slightly negative which was thought to be forbidden by tree-level positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion assuming a small cosmological constant, we compute the leading and subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in Bhatkar, Jain[J. High Energ Phys.55 (2023)] for the soft photons.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

Abstract: This article continues previous work done in arXiv:2406.01907. It is shown in more detail how vacuum partition functions and the cosmological constant vanish at all orders of perturbation theory. Further, all-multiplicity higher-loop amplitudes are given and shown to be modular invariant, to have proper factorization, and to be UV-finite at least up to one-loop level, formally even to all levels. Therefore, the model provides a modular invariant and unitary N=8 supergravity theory in twistor space with embedded Super-Yang-Mills and promising UV-finiteness behavior.</description>

      <title>Strong-Weak Coupling Duality in Scalar Lattice QFT with Application to Strong Coupling Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11503v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dualities between quantum field theories have proven to be a powerful tool in various areas of physics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective for obtaining strong coupling expansions based on a well-known technique -- the Field-space Fourier transform. We discuss the advantages of this approach for a class of Euclidean quantum field theories on a general lattice, with a focus on a self-interacting $\phi^4$ scalar field theory defined on a cubic lattice of arbitrary dimension. We establish a duality between the strong coupling regime of this theory and the weak coupling regime of a corresponding dual theory. Without loss of generality, we choose the original theory to be local and show that its dual action becomes nonlocal. Using standard diagrammatic techniques, we derive expansions for the two-point correlator and the free energy per site in the regime of large and intermediate coupling constants $g$. The obtained expansions remain regular in the limit $g \to 0$ and exhibit rapid numerical convergence in the considered regions. Numerical analysis in dimensions $d = 2$ and $d = 3$ demonstrates good agreement between our analytical results and Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we show that the strong coupling expansions are consistent with traditional weak coupling expansions.</description>

      <title>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonance, i.e., amplification in transition probability available under certain conditions, offers a powerful means for determining fundamental quantities in physics, including the time duration of the second adopted in the SI units and neutron's electric dipole moment which is directly linked to CP violation. We revisit two of the typical examples, the Rabi resonance and the Ramsey resonance, and show that both of these represent the weak value amplification when involving significant enhancement of transition probabilities and that near the resonance points they share exactly the same behavior of transition probabilities except for the measurement strength whose difference leads to the known advantage of the Ramsey resonance in the sensitivity. Conversely, as a by-product of the relationship, we may measure the weak value through quantum resonance. In fact, we argue that previous measurements of neutron electric dipole moment based on the Ramsey resonance have potentially determined the weak value of neutron's spin with much higher precision than the conventional weak value measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum gravity fluctuations in a pair of nearby gravitational wave detectors. Quantum fluctuations of long-wavelength modes of the gravitational field induce coherent fluctuations in the detectors, leading to correlated noise. We determine the variance and covariance in the lengths of the arms of the detectors, and thereby obtain the graviton noise correlation. We find that the correlation depends on the angle between the detector arms as well as their separation distance. Using our result, we propose an experimental setup to detect this noise. The suggested interferometer configuration can be used to distinguish quantum-gravitational noise from both correlated and uncorrelated sources of background noise.</description>

We perform the symplectic reduction of the space of boundary fields and give the constraints of the theory in terms of local functionals of boundary vielbein and connection. For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Extensions of the Liouville and Sinh-Gordon Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general framework to construct integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of classical, two-dimensional Toda and conformal affine Toda theories. The scheme is applied to define the extended Liouville and Sinh-Gordon models; they are based on $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color Lie algebras and their fields satisfy a parabosonic statististics. The mathematical tools here introduced are the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded covariant extensions of the Lax pair formalism and of the Polyakov's soldering procedure. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Sinh-Gordon model is derived from an affine $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color Lie algebra, mimicking a procedure originally introduced by Babelon-Bonora to derive the ordinary Sinh-Gordon model. The color Lie algebras under considerations are: the $6$-generator $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $sl_2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded affine ${\widehat{sl_2}}$ algebra with two central extensions, the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Virasoro algebra obtained from a Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations in Causal Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations (such as the variance) of causal set quantities, with particular focus on the causal set action. To facilitate calculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations between causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient decomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions that depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used in causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\mathcal M$. Our work paves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects, such as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\Lambda$ cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction through magnetic reconnection from a Kerr-Newman black hole in perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, a novel mechanism recently proposed by Comisso and Asenjo, for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$, electric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\lambda$ on the horizons, ergoregion and circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they further influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our results show that the outer horizon and the size of ergoregion do not vary monotonically with increasing dark matter parameters $\lambda$ until reaching its critical value $\lambda_c$ due to the combined counteracting effect between the black hole's charge and dark matter parameter. We identify the optimal combinations of $a$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ that allow for efficient energy extraction and high extracted power, even when the black hole is not spinning near its extremal limit. Our results ease the stringent conditions observed in other rotating black holes, where achieving comparable levels of extracted power and reconnection efficiency typically requires a near-extremal spin.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis on a bubble universe nucleated in Kerr-AdS$_5$ Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D-early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4{\rm He}$ anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Kiselev-AdS Black Holes within f (R, T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological charge and the conditions for the existence of the photon sphere (PS) in Kiselev-AdS black holes within \(f(R, T)\) gravity. We employ two different methods based on Duan's topological current \(\phi\)-mapping theory viz analize of temperature and the generalized Helmholtz free energy methods to study the topological classes of our black hole. By considering the mentioned black hole, we discuss the critical and zero points (topological charges and topological numbers) for different parameters. Our findings reveal that the Kiselev parameter \(\omega\) and the \(f(R, T)\) gravity parameter \(\gamma\) influence the number of topological charges of black holes, leading to novel insights into topological classifications. We observe that for given values of the free parameters, there exist total topological charges (\(Q_{total} = -1\)) for T-method and total topological numbers (\(W = +1\)) for the generalized Helmholtz free energy method. Our research findings elucidate that, in contrast to the scenario where \(\omega = 1/3\), in other cases, increasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of total topological charges for the black hole. Interestingly, for the phantom field (\(\omega = -4/3\)), we observed that decreasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of topological charges. Additionally, we study the results for the photon sphere. The studied models clearly reveal that the simultaneous presence of \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\) effectively expands the permissible range for \(\gamma\). In other words, the model can exhibit black hole behavior over a larger domain. Additionally, it is evident that with the stepwise reduction of \(\omega\), the region covered by singularity also diminishes and becomes more restricted. However, An interesting point about all three ranges is the elimination of the forbidden region in this model.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conductivity for the type-I and type-II phases of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <title>DHOST theories as disformal gravity: From black holes to radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript reviews the construction of exact solutions describing both (rotating) black holes and non-linear radiative spacetimes in the context of degenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We start be reviewing the structure of the DHOST theory space, the notion of degeneracy conditions and the stability of these degeneracy classes under disformal field redefinition (DFR). Then we discuss several key notions related to stationary and axi-symmetric black holes, and in particular the no-hair theorems derived in GR and in its scalar-tensor extensions. The rest of the chapters are devoted to the disformal solution generating map use to construct new hairy black holes solutions. A brief review of the rotating black holes solutions found so far in this context and a detailed description of the disformed Kerr black hole, we further comment on on-going efforts to construct rotating black hole solutions mimicking the closest the Kerr geometry. Then, we discuss how DFR affects the algebraic properties of a gravitational field and in particular its Petrov type. This provides a first systematic characterization of this effect, paving the road for constructing new solutions with a fixed Petrov type. Finally, we review more recent works aiming at characterizing the effect of a DFR on non-linear radiative geometries. We derive the general conditions for the generation of disformal tensorial gravitational wave and we study in detail a concrete example in DHOST gravity describing the new radiative effect induced by a time-dependent scalar monopoly in such higher-order theory. While most of the material presented here is a re-organized and augmented version of our published works, we have included new results and also new proposals to construct phenomenologically interesting solutions. This manuscript can be used as a review on the construction of exact solutions in DHOST gravity.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Using SimTeEx to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computations with tensors are ubiquitous in fundamental physics, and so is the usage of Einstein's dummy index convention for the contraction of indices. For instance, $T_{ia}U_{aj}$ is readily recognized as the same as $T_{ib}U_{bj}$, but a computer does not know that T[i,a]U[a,j] is equal to T[i,b]U[b,j]. Furthermore, tensors may have symmetries which can be used to simply expressions: if $U_{ij}$ is antisymmetric, then $\alpha T_{ia}U_{aj}+\beta T_{ib}U_{jb}=\left(\alpha-\beta\right)T_{ia}U_{aj}$. The fact that tensors can have elaborate symmetries, together with the problem of dummy indices, makes it complicated to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors. In this work I will present an algorithm for doing so, which was implemented in the Mathematica package SimTeEx (Simplify Tensor Expressions). It can handle any kind of tensor symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the shift and time reversal symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that the elementary shift symmetry of a single staggered field depends on a $Z_4$ subgroup of an additional $U(1)$ phase symmetry and anti-commutes with time reversal. This latter property implies that time reversal symmetry will be broken if this phase symmetry is gauged - a mixed 't Hooft anomaly. However, this anomaly can be canceled for multiples of four staggered fields. Finally we observe that the naive continuum limit of the minimal anomaly free lattice model has the symmetries and matter representations of the Pati-Salam GUT.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a case study of probabilistic approach to topological quantum field theory via the example of topological quantum mechanics. We propose that the topological correlations are realized in the large variance limit. An investigation on the relation between probabilistic topological correlations on the circle and Hochschild homology is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Three flavor QCD phase transition with M\"obius domain wall fermions</title>

Abstract: We present an updated study of the $N_f=3$ QCD phase transition using M\"{o}bius domain wall fermions. Simulations were performed on $N_t=12$ lattices with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 4 for various quark masses, at a lattice spacing of $a=0.1361(20)$ fm, corresponding to a temperature of 121(2) MeV. To clarify the nature of the phase transition, a large-volume lattice, $48^3 \times 12\times 16$, was added to analyze the volume dependence of disconnected chiral susceptibility. By examining the chiral condensate, disconnected chiral susceptibility, and Binder cumulant, and incorporating results from $24^3 \times 12 \times 16$ and $36^3 \times 12 \times 16$ lattices reported in earlier studies, we observe that the transition is consistent with a crossover at a quark mass of approximately $m_f^{\mathrm{\overline {MS}}}(2\, \mathrm{GeV}) \sim 4$ MeV at this temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of residual chiral symmetry breaking on the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility for different sizes in the 5th direction.</description>

      <title>Flyby-induced displacement: analytic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximating the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking by the hyperbolic Scarf potential, the scattering of particles by a gravitational wave generated by flyby is described analytically by following the Nikiforov-Uvarov method applied to the Scarf potential. Pure displacement arises when the wave zone contains an integer number of half-waves. The results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev.</description>

      <title>Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>
