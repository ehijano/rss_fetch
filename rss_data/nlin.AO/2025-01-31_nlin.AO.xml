      <title>Fold Bifurcation Identification through Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study employs scientific machine learning to identify transient time series of dynamical systems near a fold bifurcation of periodic solutions. The unique aspect of this work is that a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained with a relatively small amount of data and on a single, very simple system, yet it is tested on much more complicated systems. This task requires strong generalization capabilities, which are achieved by incorporating physics-based information. This information is provided through a specific pre-processing of the input data, which includes transformation into polar coordinates, normalization, transformation into the logarithmic scale, and filtering through a moving mean. The results demonstrate that such data pre-processing enables the CNN to grasp the important features related to transient time-series near a fold bifurcation, namely, the trend of the oscillation amplitude, and disregard other characteristics that are not particularly relevant, such as the vibration frequency. The developed CNN was able to correctly classify transient trajectories near a fold for a mass-on-moving-belt system, a van der Pol-Duffing oscillator with an attached tuned mass damper, and a pitch-and-plunge wing profile. The results contribute to the progress towards the development of similar CNNs effective in real-life applications such as safety monitoring of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Origin of Limit Cycles, Fixed Points, and Critical Slowing Down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>A modified Hegselmann-Krause model for interacting voters and political parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hegselmann--Krause model is a prototypical model for opinion dynamics. It models the stochastic time evolution of an agent's or voter's opinion in response to the opinion of other like-minded agents. The Hegselmann--Krause model only considers the opinions of voters; we extend it here by incorporating the dynamics of political parties which influence and are influenced by the voters. We show in numerical simulations for $1$- and $2$-dimensional opinion spaces that, as for the original Hegselmann--Krause model, the modified model exhibits opinion cluster formation as well as a phase transition from disagreement to consensus. We provide an analytical sufficient condition for the formation of unanimous consensus in which voters and parties collapse to the same point in opinion space in the deterministic case. Using mean-field theory, we further derive an approximation for the critical noise strength delineating consensus from non-consensus in the stochastically driven modified Hegselmann--Krause model. We compare our analytical findings with simulations of the modified Hegselmann--Krause model.</description>

      <title>Improving the mean-field approximation in continuous models of population dynamics with nonlocal dispersal: applications to vegetation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spot patterns, in which vegetation patches form a hexagonal lattice, are frequent in nature and could serve as an early-warning indicator of abrupt vegetation collapses. Consequently, they have been intensively studied using both individual-based models and density-based field equations. Yet, the relationship between these two approaches remains unclear, particularly in scenarios where vegetation dynamics exhibit strong long-range spatial correlations and traditional mean-field approximations fail. To solve this issue, we develop a new method that refines mean-field approximations by describing both the dynamics of the biomass density field and its spatial correlations. This new approach harnesses the strengths of both individual and density-based models, treating spatial correlations explicitly and allowing for the identification of spatial instabilities resulting in periodic patterns. Our results indicate that this new approximation predicts the parameter regimes where regular periodic patterns emerge more accurately than mean-field models, suggesting that it could provide a more robust framework to perform further nonlinear analysis.</description>
