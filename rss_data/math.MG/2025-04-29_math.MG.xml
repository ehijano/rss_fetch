      <title>A New Decision- Making Method Based on Shannon Entropy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because the appropriate combination of existing elements and establishing coordination between them as a consequence of making the right decision to accomplish the intended objective is achieved, management is now one of the main pillars of community management. Decisions are made in the majority of situations when the decision maker is pleased with the conclusion based on numerous factors. Several criteria are used instead of one measure of optimality in multi-criteria decision making, which has been studied by numerous academics in recent decades. The importance of the indicators in this type of decision making is clearly not equal, and it is necessary to understand the coefficient of importance or weight of each of these indicators in decision making. In this work, a novel technique termed scattering axis Dispersion-based Weighting Method (D.W.M) is suggested to address weighing issues, with the closest method in terms of computational logic being their entropy. After constructing the option's criterion matrix, the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation are determined, and then the weight of each criterion is calculated, according to the proposed D.W.M technique. Several numerical examples have been utilized to demonstrate and assess the suggested technique. In addition, the Shannon entropy approach, which is a commonly used weighting method, was chosen to compare the findings. The statistical results demonstrate that these two weighing techniques have a strong connection. In compared to the Shannon entropy technique, the suggested method has the following advantages: Minimal computational burden The data does not need to be normalized. Its use in the case of negative data.</description>

      <title>Some comments on the mth-order Projection Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Petty's projection inequality is a sharp upper bound for the volume of the polar projection body of a convex body. Lutwak later introduced the concept of mixed projection bodies, and extended Petty's projection inequality. Alonso-Guti\'{e}rrez later did a type of stability for Petty's projection inequality.
  In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order setting and extended the difference body to that setting. In a previous work, we, working with Haddad, Putterman, Roysdon and Ye, established an extension of the projection operator to this setting. In this note, we continue this study for the mixed projection body operator as well as the question of stability.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that there exists a step-two Carnot group on which the new lower bound of the curvature exponent given in arXiv:2308.15811v2 can be strictly less than the curvature exponent by studying the convergence of the structure constants of Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this work, we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Identification of Lattice Quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Quaternion Domain Super MDS for 3D Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quaternion-domain super multidimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). This algorithm reformulates the conventional SMDS, which was originally developed in the real domain, into the quaternion domain. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method enables the construction of a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative distance and angular (phase) information between nodes, maximizing the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation via singular value decomposition (SVD). The simulation results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates a notable enhancement in localization accuracy relative to the conventional SMDS algorithm, particularly in scenarios characterized by substantial measurement errors.</description>
