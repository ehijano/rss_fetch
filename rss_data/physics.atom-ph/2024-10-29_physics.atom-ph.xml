      <title>The blackbody radiation vibrational level shifts in the ground electronic state of N$_{2}^{+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homonuclear molecules have emerged as a crucial component in the pursuit of frequency standards, offering a promising avenue for the discovery of new physics phenomena that transcend the standard model. They also provide a unique approach to constraining variations in fundamental constants over time, thereby complementing the capabilities of atomic clocks. A notable challenge faced by molecular and single atomic quantum systems is the management of blackbody radiation (BBR), which introduces significant systematic errors and is challenging to regulate effectively. To address this issue, we perform {\it ab-initio} quantum chemical calculations to accurately determine the potential energy curve and the polarizability tensor for the ground state of the N$_2^+$ molecular ion, one of the most promising candidates for searching for variation of $m_{e}/m_{p}$ and creating frequency standards. We then calculate the BBR shifts affecting the vibrational levels of the ground electronic X$^2\Sigma_g^+$ state, marking a substantial contribution towards the precise experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Modelling spectra of hot alkali vapour in the saturation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser spectroscopy of hot atomic vapours has been studied extensively. Theoretical models that predict the absolute value of the electric susceptibility are crucial for optimising the design of photonic devices that use hot vapours, and for extracting parameters, such as external fields, when these devices are used as sensors. To date, most of the models developed have been restricted to the weak-probe regime. However, fulfilling the weak-probe power constraint may not always be easy, desired or necessary. Here we present a model for simulating the spectra of alkali-metal vapours for a variety of experimental parameters, most distinctly at intensities beyond weak laser fields. The model incorporates optical pumping effects and transit-time broadening. We test the performance of the model by performing spectroscopy of Rb-87 in a magnetic field of 0.6 T, where isolated atomic resonances can be addressed. We find very good agreement between the model and data for three different beam diameters and a variation of intensity of over five orders of magnitude. The non-overlapping absorption lines allow us to differentiate the saturation behaviour of open and closed transitions. While our model was only experimentally verified for the D2 line of rubidium, the software is also capable of simulating spectra of rubidium, sodium, potassium and caesium over both D lines.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Crystal Receiver for Rydberg Atom-Based Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom-based sensors use atoms dressed by lasers to detect and measure radio frequency electromagnetic fields. The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of ~24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.</description>

      <title>Dual-species Optical tweezer for Rb and K atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical tweezer experiment with neutral atoms is a focal topic in cold atom physics due to its significant potential in quantum computing and simulation. Here, we present the realization of a dual-species optical tweezer for both Rb and K atoms, marking the first step towards creating a polar molecule optical tweezer array. Initially, Rb and K atoms are collected using a dual magneto-optical trap (MOT) and further cooled to 7 $\mu$K for Rb and 10 $\mu$K for K. By employing 850 nm tweezer beams, we demonstrate the ability to capture individual Rb or K atoms. The filling ratios of Rb and K can be finely adjusted by controlling the atomic densities of both species. Utilizing the post-selection technique, we can create a deterministic array of two-species atoms, paving the way for future polar molecule array formation.</description>

      <title>Magic running and standing wave optical traps for Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic trapping of ground and Rydberg states, which equalizes the AC Stark shifts of these two levels, enables increased ground-to-Rydberg state coherence times. We measure via photon storage and retrieval how the ground-to-Rydberg state coherence depends on trap wavelength for two different traps and find different optimal wavelengths for a $1$D optical lattice trap and a running wave optical dipole trap. Comparison to theory reveals that this is caused by the Rydberg electron sampling different potential landscapes. The observed difference increases for higher principal quantum numbers, where the extent of the Rydberg electron wave function becomes larger than the optical lattice period. Our analysis shows that optimal magic trapping conditions depend on the trap geometry, in particular for optical lattices and tweezers.</description>

      <title>Cavity dark mode mediated by atom array without atomic scattering loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a ring cavity strongly interacting with an atom array with configurable spatial structures. By preparing the atom array with a maximized structure factor, we observe the emergence of a cavity dark mode, where the standing-wave nodes are dynamically locked to the positions of the atoms. The dark mode is decoupled from the atoms, protecting the system from dissipation through atomic scattering, but still mediates strong coupling and enables efficient conversion between two optical modes. Moreover, we impart an arbitrary large phase shift on the converted optical fields by translating the atom array. This strongly interacting ring cavity system with single-atom addressability opens ways to quantum optical engineering and the generation of photonic quantum states based on the geometrical structure of atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Probing the goldstino excitation via tunneling current noise in a Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.</description>

      <title>Hollow Beam Optical Ponderomotive Trap for Ultracold Neutral Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. This work examines the potential of ponderomotive optical confinement for ultracold neutral plasma (UNP) using a high-power cw CO$_2$ laser. We identify optimal conditions for experimental realization and investigate transient processes during UNP expansion in the ponderomotive potential. A hollow laser beam simultaneously traps charged particles and Rydberg atoms formed via three-body recombination in UNP in the dark region, alongside neutral atoms in intensity maxima. This dual trapping capability has the potential to be applied in the trapping of antiproton-positron plasma, which could enhance antimatter production.</description>

Abstract: We present the implementation and performance analysis of a portable, rack-mounted standalone warm vapor quantum memory system, that also includes the laser package, control electronics and data processing hardware. The optical memory is based on long-lived hyperfine ground states of Cesium which are connected to an excited state via the $D_1$ line at 895 nm in a $\Lambda$-configuration. The memory is operated with weak coherent pulses containing on average $&lt;1$ photons per pulse. The long-term stability of the memory efficiency and storage fidelity is demonstrated at the single-photon level together with operation in a non-laboratory environment.</description>

      <title>The Advantages of Polarization Control in RABBITT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RABBITT setup is theoretically studied for various combinations of XUV and IR field components polarization: 'linear+linear', `linear+circular' with crossed propagation directions, and `circular+circular' with parallel propagation directions. The general properties of photoelectron angular distributions and their responses to the variation of the IR pulse delay are studied. Numerical simulations are performed for the neon valence shell ionization into the region of structureless continuum using two approaches based on time dependent perturbation theory and solution of rate equations. To distinguish between "geometrical" governed by fields' polarization and spectroscopic features, additional analysis for the case of $s$-shell ionization is presented.</description>

      <title>Limits on scalar dark matter interactions with particles other than the photon via loop corrections to the scalar-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is limited information about the interaction strength of a scalar dark matter candidate with hadrons and leptons for a scalar particle mass exceeding $10^{-3}$ eV while its interaction with photon is well studied. The scalar-photon coupling constant receives quantum corrections from one-loop Feynman diagrams which involve the scalar-lepton, scalar-quark, and scalar-W boson vertices. We calculate these one-loop quantum corrections and find new limits on the scalar particle interactions with electron, muon, tau, quarks, nucleons, gluons, Higgs, and W bosons by re-purposing the results of experiments measuring the scalar-photon interaction. Limits on interactions of heavy leptons and quarks have been obtained for the first time, and limits on other interactions in certain mass intervals are 2 to 15 orders of magnitude stronger than those presented in previous publications and exclude the resolution of the muon $g-2$ anomaly with scalar particle.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>GHZ protocols enhance frequency metrology despite spontaneous decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of correlated states and measurements promises improvements in the accuracy of frequency metrology and the stability of atomic clocks. However, developing strategies robust against dominant noise processes remains challenging. We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains of up to 2.25 dB, comparable to fundamental bounds for up to about 80 atoms in the presence of decoherence. This result is surprising since GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol.</description>

Abstract: We present semi-analytic solutions for atomic transition rates in hydrogenic atoms induced by scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor interactions. Our results agree with quantum electrodynamics predictions to $\sim 0.005\,\%$ precision, and further allow us to calculate absorption and emission rates for axions, hidden photons, light scalars or other dark matter candidates for hydrogen and hydrogenic ions. These results can be used to inform searches for light new physics as well as in calculations relevant to searches for fifth forces or varying fundamental constants, with applications from astrophysics to laboratory spectroscopy experiments. We also provide a dedicated tool for the construction of hydrogenic transition amplitudes: "Computation of hydrogen radial INtegrals and COefficients" ($\texttt{CINCO}$).</description>

      <title>Pancharatnam phase as an entanglement witness for quantum gravity in dual Stern-Gerlach interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in the fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observations provide evidence of quantumness. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and that gravity is quantum. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers and show that the Pancharatnam phase is a tool that qualitatively distinguishes semiclassical from quantum gravity. The semiclassical evolution is equivalent to that of two independent interferometers in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution in the Bloch sphere. By contrast, in the quantum case, the quantum amplitudes are the sources of the gravitational field, inducing entanglement between the two interferometers, and the phase is continuous.</description>
