      <title>An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Accessible Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge. This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models (LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment, retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and democratize network control for everyday users.</description>

      <title>An SDR-Based Test Platform for 5G NTN Prototyping and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of satellite communication into 5G has been formalized in 3GPP Release 17 through the specification of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), marking a significant step toward achieving global connectivity. However, the early-stage maturity of 5G NTN standards and the lack of commercial NTN-capable equipment hinder extensive performance validation and system prototyping. To address this gap, this paper proposes a software-defined radio (SDR) test platform with General-Purpose Processor (GPP) processing, leveraging Amarisoft's 5G NTN protocol stack software while performing custom system integration and adaptation for real satellite operation. The platform supports bidirectional communication between an SDR-based NTN gNB and UE emulator through a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite link, with full compliance to 3GPP NTN specifications. We provide detailed insights into the system architecture, SDR hardware-software co-design, and satellite gateway adaptations. Through field trials, we evaluate the performance metrics including downlink throughput and round-trip time. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of SDR-based platforms for NTN testing, and highlight their potential in bridging current implementation gaps before widespread commercial deployment.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Semantic Communication for Vehicular Networks: Challenges and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce communication delay in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications within vehicular networks (VNs). However, the deployment of vehicular SemCom networks (VN-SemComNets) faces critical trust challenges in information transmission, semantic encoding, and communication entity reliability. This paper proposes an innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are pointed out to advance this emerging field.</description>

      <title>BSB: Towards Demand-Aware Peer Selection With XOR-based Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer networks, as a key enabler of modern networked and distributed systems, rely on peer-selection algorithms to optimize their scalability and performance. Peer-selection methods have been studied extensively in various aspects, including routing mechanisms and communication overhead. However, many state-of-the-art algorithms are oblivious to application-specific data traffic. This mismatch between design and demand results in underutilized connections, which inevitably leads to longer paths and increased latency. In this work, we propose a novel demand-aware peer-selection algorithm, called Binary Search in Buckets (BSB). Our demand-aware approach adheres to a local and greedy XOR-based routing mechanism, ensuring compatibility with existing protocols and mechanisms. We evaluate our solution against two prior algorithms by conducting simulations on real-world and synthetic communication network traces. The results of our evaluations show that BSB can offer up to a 43% improvement compared to two selected algorithms from the literature.</description>

      <title>A Novel Integrated Architecture for Intent Based Approach and Zero Touch Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to Sixth Generation (6G) networks presents challenges in managing quality of service (QoS) of diverse applications and achieving Service Level Agreements (SLAs) under varying network conditions. Hence, network management must be automated with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve real-time requirements. Zero touch network (ZTN) is one of the frameworks to automate network management with mechanisms such as closed loop control to ensure that the goals are met perpetually. Intent- Based Networking (IBN) specifies the user intents with diverse network requirements or goals which are then translated into specific network configurations and actions. This paper presents a novel architecture for integrating IBN and ZTN to serve the intent goals. Users provides the intent in the form of natural language, e.g., English, which is then translated using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG)) into Network Intent LanguagE (Nile). The Nile intent is then passed on to the BiLSTM and Q-learning based ZTN closed loop framework as a goal which maintains the intent under varying network conditions. Thus, the proposed architecture can work autonomously to ensure the network performance goal is met by just specifying the user intent in English. The integrated architecture is also implemented on a testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI). Additionally, to evaluate the architecture, an optimization problem is formulated which evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate how ZTN can help achieve the bandwidth goals autonomously set by user intent. The simulation and the testbed results are compared and they show similar trend. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Quality of Experience (QoE) is also measured to indicate the user satisfaction of the intent.</description>

      <title>RePro: Leveraging Large Language Models for Semi-Automated Reproduction of Networking Research Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducing networking research is a critical but challenging task due to the scarcity of open-source code. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate code generation, current approaches lack the generalizability required for the diverse networking field. To address this, we propose RePro, a semi-automated reproduction framework that leverages advanced prompt engineering to reproduce network systems from their research papers. RePro combines few-shot in-context learning with Structured and Semantic Chain of Thought (SCoT/SeCoT) techniques to systematically translate a paper's description into an optimized, executable implementation. The framework operates through a three-stage pipeline: system description extraction, structural code generation, and code optimization. Our evaluation with five state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse network sub-domains demonstrates that RePro significantly reduces reproduction time compared to manual efforts while achieving comparable system performance, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RIS-Aided Digital Over-the-Air Computing for Edge AI Inference: Joint Feature Quantization and Active-Passive Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision of 6G networks aims to enable edge inference by leveraging ubiquitously deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models, facilitating intelligent environmental perception for a wide range of applications. A critical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate multi-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting perception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising technique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform superposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however, incompatible with existing digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable of simultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits potential for enhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital AirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map high-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated into symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp transceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across agents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals. To endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a surrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of feature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we formulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization, and develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit allocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and hybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy and uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</description>

      <title>TSKAN: Interpretable Machine Learning for QoE modeling over Time Series Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML) techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches, our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Flight Dynamics to Sensing Modalities: Exploiting Drone Ground Effect for Accurate Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation. Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials, making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.</description>

      <title>Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.</description>

      <title>B5GRoam: A Zero Trust Framework for Secure and Efficient On-Chain B5G Roaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roaming settlement in 5G and beyond networks demands secure, efficient, and trustworthy mechanisms for billing reconciliation between mobile operators. While blockchain promises decentralization and auditability, existing solutions suffer from critical limitations-namely, data privacy risks, assumptions of mutual trust, and scalability bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we present B5GRoam, a novel on-chain and zero-trust framework for secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable roaming settlements. B5GRoam introduces a cryptographically verifiable call detail record (CDR) submission protocol, enabling smart contracts to authenticate usage claims without exposing sensitive data. To preserve privacy, we integrate non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) that allow on-chain verification of roaming activity without revealing user or network details. To meet the high-throughput demands of 5G environments, B5GRoam leverages Layer 2 zk-Rollups, significantly reducing gas costs while maintaining the security guarantees of Layer 1. Experimental results demonstrate a throughput of over 7,200 tx/s with strong privacy and substantial cost savings. By eliminating intermediaries and enhancing verifiability, B5GRoam offers a practical and secure foundation for decentralized roaming in future mobile networks.</description>
