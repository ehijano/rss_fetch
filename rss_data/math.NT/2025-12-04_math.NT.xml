      <title>On the sparsity of integers $a$ in solutions to $a!b!=c!$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Diophantine equation $$ a!b! = c! $$ due to Erd\H{o}s, where we assume $a \leq b$. It is widely believed that there are only finitely many nontrivial solutions, and considerable work has been dedicated to showing this. In one direction, Luca (2007) showed that the set of $c$'s which can appear in solutions has density zero. Here we show that the set of $a$'s appearing in solutions is also sparse. In particular, $a$ cannot be one less than a large fraction of primes, and, under the assumption that $\sqrt[k]{a!} \mod 1$ is equidistributed in an appropriate sense, we show that the set of such $a$ has asymptotic density zero.</description>

      <title>Structural Existence of Prime Constellations: Asymptotic Spectral Stability in Finite Sieve Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the "Parity Barrier", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the "Null Hypothesis") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a "Prime Desert", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(\mu)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($\Omega(\mu^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Weighted geodesic restrictions of arithmetic eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an arithmetic hyperbolic surface, $\psi$ a Hecke-Maass form, $\ell$ a geodesic segment on $X$, and $\mu$ a Borel measure supported on $\ell$ with dimension greater than 1/2. We obtain a power saving over the local bound of Eswarathasan and Pramanik for the $L^2$ norm of $\psi$ with respect to $\mu$, which is a weighted generalization of Marshall's geodesic restriction bound and is proved by applying the method of arithmetic amplification. On a general 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold, we also obtain a Kakeya-Nikodym bound for the $L^2$ norm of any Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction with respect to a Borel measure supported on a geodesic segment with dimension greater than 1/2.</description>

      <title>The distribution of prime values of random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bateman--Horn Conjecture predicts how often an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ assumes prime values. We demonstrate that with sufficient averaging in the coefficients of $f$ (viz. exponential in the size of the inputs), one can not only prove Bateman--Horn results on average but also pin down precise information about the distribution of prime values. We show that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^k$ sense for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$) satisfy the Bateman--Horn Conjecture, and that that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^2$ sense) satisfy an appropriate polynomial analogue of the Hardy--Littlewood Prime Tuples Conjecture. We use the latter to prove that 100\% of polynomials satisfy the appropriate analogue of the Poisson Tail Conjecture, in the sense that the distribution of the gaps between consecutive prime values around the average spacing is Poisson.
  We also study the frequencies of sign patterns of the Liouville function evaluated at the consecutive outputs of $f$; viewing $f$ as a random variable, we establish the limiting distribution for every sign pattern. The Chowla problem along random polynomials is a special case. A key input behind all of our arguments is Leng's recent quantitative work on the higher-order Fourier uniformity of the von Mangoldt and M\"obius functions (in turn relying on Leng, Sah, and Sawhney's quantitative inverse theorem for the Gowers norms).</description>

      <title>Mean values of the Riemann zeta function at shifted zeros under the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we obtain asymptotic formulas for $\sum_{0&lt;\gamma&lt;T}\zeta(\rho+\delta)\zeta(1-\rho+\overline{\delta})$ in the region $-\frac{a}{\log T} \leq \Re \delta \leq \frac{1}{2}+\frac{a}{\log T}$, $|\Im \delta|\ll 1$. Unconditionally, this asymptotic formula was recently obtained by Garunk\v{s}tis and Novikas in essentially the same region, with a slight incompleteness. Assuming RH, we obtain a sharper error term, and we also correct an inaccuracy in the unconditional error term there.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy and Sato-Tate groups of $y^2=x^{p^2}-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that an abelian variety is degenerate if its Hodge ring is not generated by divisor classes. Degeneracy leads to some interesting challenges when computing Sato-Tate groups, and there are currently few examples and techniques presented in the literature. In this paper we focus on the Jacobians of the family of curves $C_{p^2}: y^2=x^{p^2}-1$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using a construction developed by Shioda in the 1980s, we are able to characterize so-called indecomposable Hodge classes as well as the Sato-Tate groups of these Jacobian varieties. Our work is inspired by computation, and examples and methods are described throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Spectral Reciprocity: A Fourier--Analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Fourier--analytic framework for establishing spectral reciprocity formulas linking $\mathrm{GL}_3$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2$ automorphic spectra over number fields. The method applies uniformly to cuspidal and non-cuspidal $\mathrm{GL}_3$ representations and treats Motohashi-type and Blomer--Khan-type reciprocities in a parallel manner, revealing intrinsic connections between them and extending each to new settings. We also obtain explicit weight transforms in the analytic newvector and spherical cases. Applications include first-moment estimates for $\mathrm{GL}_3\times\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over number fields, an explicit twisted fourth moment for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over totally real fields, a sharp upper bound for the fifth moment, subconvexity for triple product $L$-functions, and new simultaneous nonvanishing results.</description>

      <title>A relative trace formula identity for non-tempered spherical varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by some previous works in residue method and the recent theory of the relative Langlands duality, we prove a relative trace formula identity that compares the period integral of non-tempered spherical varieties with the period integral of a tempered spherical varieties associated to a Levi subgroup. This allows us to incorporate numerous relative trace formula comparisons studied during the last four decades under the relative Langlands duality framework. We will also propose a conjectural comparison for general non-tempered Hamiltonian spaces.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Size of Tame Shafarevich Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with a finite set $S$ of primes. We study the cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$, in particular the Shafarevich groups $\Sha^i_S(K,A)$ for $i=1,2$ for tame sets $S$, i.e., for sets $S$ that contain no primes above $p$. When $S$ contains all primes above $p$ (the ``wild'' setting), it is a consequence of global Poitou-Tate duality that $\Sha^1_S(K,A')^\vee \simeq \Sha^2_S(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) $ is non-increasing as $S$ increases. The same applies when $G_{K,S}$ is replaced by its maximal pro-$p$ quotient $G_{K,S}(p)$. In [4] it was shown that for $S$ tame and $A=\mathbb{F}_p$ with trivial action, the group $\Sha^2_S(K, A)$ can increase as $S$ increases to $S\cup X$, and even attain its maximal dimension, $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p} \RusB_S(K,\mathbb{F}_p)$, for carefully chosen $X$. We strengthen this to general $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$ where $S$ is tame. We use Liu's definition [7] of $\RusB_S(K,A)$ to show that $\Sha^2_S(K,A) \hookrightarrow \RusB_S(K,A)$ and that there exist infinitely many tame sets of primes $X$ of $K$ such that $\Sha^2_{S\cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_{S \cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\twoheadleftarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) \hookleftarrow \Sha^2_S(K,A)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using Ikeda's theory for a compatible family of Eisenstein series, we explicitly construct Ikeda type lifts on the special orthogonal group $G=\SO(3,n+1)$ over $\Q$ with $n\ge 3$ which splits everywhere at finite places. Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to $\SL_2(\Z)$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and
  $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Classification of totally real number fields via their zeta function, regulator, and log unit lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.</description>

We generalize a result of Bugeaud--Dujella on a special family of bipartite Diophantine tuples and affirmatively resolve a related question posed by the second author. Additionally, we establish new connections between bipartite Diophantine tuples and several known variants of Diophantine tuples, including those introduced by Banks--Luca--Szalay and Kihel--Kihel.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the $p$-adic valuations originally obtained by Carmichael for the sequences obtained by applying M\"obius inversion to Lucas sequences to $p$-adic congruences, from which we immediately derive corresponding congruences for Lucas sequences. As a corollary, we also establish some constraints on the entry point behavior of primes in Lucas sequences, on the basis of which we conjecture the presence of a strong Chebyshev-like bias in real regular Lucas sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the number of rational points of bounded height on irreducible affine hypersurfaces. More precisely, given an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X_1, \dots, X_n]$, we prove an upper bound on the number of points $(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{Q}^n$ such that $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = 0$ and each component has height at most $B$. To prove this, we require a quantitative form of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, where we bound the number of reducible specialisations of an irreducible polynomial at rational points of bounded height.</description>

Abstract: If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b&gt;a&gt;1$, we completely characterize ``long'' arithmetic progressions in the sumsets of the geometric progressions $1, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots$ and $1, b, b^2, b^3, \ldots$.

      <title>Orderings of k-Markov Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-Markov numbers, introduced by Gyoda and Matsushita, are those which appear in positive integral solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(xy + xz + yz) = (3+3k)xyz$. When $k =0$, this recovers the ordinary Markov numbers. A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras. We show here that $k$-Markov numbers also satisfy Aigner's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Additive relations in irrational powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \{1^c, 2^c, \dots, N^c\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \not \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \to \infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\{p^c : \textrm{$p$ prime}\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.</description>

      <title>Structure theorems for the heart of LCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohomology theories with values in LCA (locally compact abelian) groups suffer from the problem that the latter do not form an abelian category. However, the category LCA has a canonical abelian category envelope, the heart of a suitable t-structure. It adds formal cokernel objects. We show the surprising result that these abstract cokernels can also be interpreted as Hausdorff topological abelian groups, at least up to lattice isogenies. These need not be locally compact.</description>

      <title>Moduli of vector bundles on $\mu_n$-gerbes over genus 2 curves and the period-index problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for describing vector bundles on $\mu_n$-gerbes over curves and illustrate the construction through two detailed examples. Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel type of connection between random walks and analytic number theory. Working with a random walk on the circle group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in which each step is a random integer multiple of a given quadratic irrational $\alpha$, we show that the rate of convergence to uniformity in the quadratic Wasserstein metric (also known as the periodic $L^2$ discrepancy) is governed by deep arithmetic invariants of the ring of algebraic integers of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, such as fundamental units and special values of zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the periods of eigenfunctions on arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds over surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\psi$ be a Hecke-Maass form on a compact congruence arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold $X$, and let $Y$ be a hyperbolic surface in $X$ that is not necessarily closed. We obtain a power saving result over the local bound for the period of $\psi$ along $Y$, by applying the method of arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak.</description>

      <title>An Arithmetic Sum Associated with the Classical Theta Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sum $S(h,k):=\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{j+1+[hj/k]}$ appears in the modular transformation formulae of the classical theta function $\vartheta_3(z)$. The double sum $S(k) := \sum_{h=1}^{k-1}S(h,k)$ has a remarkable distribution of values. Although properties for $S(k)$ and a related sum can be established, several interesting conjectures are open.</description>

      <title>A Question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham on Covering Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham (Erd\H{o}s and Graham, 1980) asked if there exists an $n$ such that the divisors of $n$ greater than 1 are the moduli of a distinct covering system with the following property: If there exists an integer which satisfies two congruences in the system, $a\mod d$ and $a'\mod d'$, then $\gcd(d,d')=1$. We show that such an $n$ does not exist. This problem is part of Problem # 204 on the website www.erdosproblems.com, compiled and maintained by Thomas Bloom. We also study when the divisors of $n$ greater than $1$ can form a congruence system satisfying the above condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disproving a conjecture of Bleicher and Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rational numbers infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>

      <title>New Obstacles to Multiple Recurrence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>
