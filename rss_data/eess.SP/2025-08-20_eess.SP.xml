      <title>CKM-Assisted Physical-Layer Security for Resilience Against Unknown Eavesdropping Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) is an emerging data-driven toolbox that captures our awareness of the wireless channel and enables efficient communication and resource allocation beyond the state of the art. In this work, we consider CKM for improving physical-layer security (PLS) in the presence of a passive eavesdropper (Eve), without making any assumptions about Eve's location or channel state information (CSI). We employ highly directional mmWave transmissions, with the confidential message jointly encoded across multiple beams. By exploiting CKM, we derive an algorithm for time and power allocation among the beams that maximizes the absolute secrecy rate under the worst-case scenario for Eve's location.</description>

      <title>Airy beams for near-field communications: Fundamentals, potentials, and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-generation wireless networks, the combination of electrically large radiating apertures and high-frequency transmission extends the radiating near-field region around the transmitter. In this region, unlike in the far field, the wavefront is nonplanar, which provides additional degrees of freedom to shape and steer the transmitted beam in a desired manner. In this paper, we focus on Airy beams, which may exhibit several highly desirable properties in the near-field region. Ideally, these beams follow self-accelerating (curved) trajectories, demonstrate resilience to perturbations through self-healing, and maintain a consistent intensity profile across all planes perpendicular to the propagation direction, making them effectively diffraction-free. Specifically, we first present the underlying principles of self-accelerating beams radiated by continuous aperture field distributions. We then address several challenges regarding the generation of Airy beams, including their exponential decay due to finite energy constraints and spatial truncation of the aperture. Moreover, we examine their free-space propagation characteristics. The second part of the paper focuses on the propagation behavior of Airy beams in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. A comparison is also presented between Airy beams and Gaussian beams. Our theoretical and numerical results show that Airy beams may offer a performance advantage over Gaussian beams in certain NLoS channels, provided that their key properties are largely preserved, specifically, self-acceleration along a parabolic trajectory and diffraction-free propagation. In the presence of an obstacle, this requires that the portion of the transmit aperture with a clear line-of-sight to the receiver is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Joint AP Selection and Power Allocation for Unicast-Multicast Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint unicast and multicast transmissions are becoming increasingly important in practical wireless systems, such as Internet of Things networks. This paper investigates a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system that simultaneously supports both transmission types, with multicast serving multiple groups. Exact closed-form expressions for the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE) of both unicast and multicast users are derived for zero-forcing and maximum ratio precoding designs. Accordingly, a weighted sum SE (SSE) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the access point (AP) selection and power allocation. The optimization framework accounts for practical constraints, including the maximum transmit power per AP, fronthaul capacity limitations between APs and the central processing unit, and quality-of-service requirements for all users. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a tractable structure, and an accelerated projected gradient (APG)-based algorithm is developed to efficiently obtain near-optimal solutions. As a performance benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is also implemented. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach significantly enhances the SSE across various system setups and precoding strategies. In particular, the APG-based algorithm achieves substantial complexity reduction while maintaining competitive performance, making it well-suited for large-scale practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC with Time Synchronization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) system, which effectively mitigates intra-cell interference and provides precise sensing accuracy, is a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, to fully capitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS) between access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current synchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in the development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel CF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial diversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce the impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the worst-case Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint optimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy communication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust optimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex problem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an MA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization variables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and transmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors. Moreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies, the proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity, thus validating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Distributed Distortion-Aware Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) architecture is a promising enabler for 6G, offering spectrum efficiency and ubiquitous coverage. However, real deployments suffer from hardware impairments, especially nonlinear distortion from power amplifiers (PAs), which degrades both communication and sensing. To address this, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness. The PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial, where the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points (APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions. We design a distributed distortion-aware worst-case robust optimization framework that explicitly incorporates uncertainty in 3RDCs. First, we analyze the worst-case impact of PA distortion on both the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and communication rate. Then, to address the resulting non-convexity, we apply successive convex approximation (SCA) for estimating the 3RDCs. With these, we jointly optimize beamforming and MA positions under transmit power and sensing constraints. To efficiently solve this highly non-convex problem, we develop an MA-enabled self-attention convolutional graph neural network (SACGNN) algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the communication-sensing trade-off under distortion and outperforms fixed-position antenna baselines in terms of robustness and capacity, thereby highlighting the advantages of MA-aided CF-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Particle Filtering for RSS-Based Target Localization under Varying Noise Levels and Sensor Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target localization is a critical task in various applications, such as search and rescue, surveillance, and wireless sensor networks. When a target emits a radio frequency (RF) signal, spatially distributed sensors can collect signal measurements to estimate the target's location. Among various measurement modalities, received signal strength (RSS) is particularly attractive due to its low cost, low power consumption, and ease of deployment. While particle filtering has previously been applied to RSS-based target localization, few studies have systematically analyzed its performance under varying sensor geometries and RSS noise levels. This paper addresses this gap by designing and evaluating a particle filtering algorithm for localizing a stationary target. The proposed method is compared with a conventional RSS-based trilateration approach across different sensor configurations and noise conditions. Simulation results indicate that particle filtering provides more accurate target localization than trilateration, particularly in scenarios with unfavorable sensor geometries and high RSS noise.</description>

      <title>Low-power, Energy-efficient, Cardiologist-level Atrial Fibrillation Detection for Wearable Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia and major risk factor for cardiovascular complications. While commercially available devices and supporting Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms exist for reliable detection of AF, the scaling of this technology to the amount of people who need this diagnosis is still a major challenge. This paper presents a novel wearable device, designed specifically for the early and reliable detection of AF. We present an FPGA-based patch-style wearable monitor with embedded deep learning-based AF detection. Operating with 3.8mW system power, which is 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art, the device enables continuous AF detection for over three weeks while achieving 95% accuracy, surpassing cardiologist-level performance. A key innovation is the combination of energy-efficient hardware-software co-design and optimized power management through the application of hardware-aware neural architecture search. This advancement represents a significant step toward scalable, reliable, and sustainable AF monitoring.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Photon-Trapping Spectrometer-on-a-Chip on Silicon Platform with Extended Near-Infrared Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact, noise-resilient reconstructive spectrometer-on-a-chip that achieves high-resolution hyperspectral imaging across an extended near-infrared (NIR) range up to 1100nm. The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving &lt;0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (&gt;7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. The results establish a pathway toward fully integrated, high-performance hyperspectral sensing in a CMOS-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Power and Rate Allocations for Positive-rate Covert Communications in Block-Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to achieve keyless covert communication with a positive-rate in Rayleigh block-fading channels. Specifically, the transmitter and the legitimate receiver are assumed to have either causal or non-causal knowledge of the \ac{CSI} for both the legitimate and the warden channels, while the warden only knows the statistical distribution of the \ac{CSI}. Two problem formulations are considered in this work: (a) Power allocation: maximizing the sum covert rate subject to a maximum power constraint, and (b) Rate allocation: minimizing the power consumption subject to a minimum covert rate constraint. Both problems are formulated based on recent information theoretical results on covert communication over state-dependent channels. When the \ac{CSI} of each fading block is known non-causally, we propose a novel three-step method to solve both the power and rate allocation problems. In the case where the \ac{CSI} is known causally, the power allocation problem can be formulated as \ac{MDP} and be solved using a \ac{DDQN} approach. Although the rate allocation problem under causal \ac{CSI} does not directly conform to an \ac{MDP} structure, it can be approximately solved using the \ac{DDQN} trained for power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power and rate allocation methods and provide comprehensive performance comparisons across different allocation schemes.</description>

      <title>BioGAP-Ultra: A Modular Edge-AI Platform for Wearable Multimodal Biosignal Acquisition and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for continuous physiological monitoring and human-machine interaction in real-world settings calls for wearable platforms that are flexible, low-power, and capable of on-device intelligence. This work presents BioGAP-Ultra, an advanced multimodal biosensing platform that supports synchronized acquisition of diverse electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals such as EEG, EMG, ECG, and PPG while enabling embedded AI processing at state-of-the-art energy efficiency. BioGAP-Ultra is a major extension of our previous design, BioGAP [1], aimed at meeting the rapidly growing requirements of wearable biosensing applications. It features (i) increased on-device storage (x2 SRAM, x4 FLASH), (ii) improved wireless connectivity (1.4 Mbit/s bandwidth, x4 higher than BioGAP), (iii) enhanced number of signal modalities (from 3 to 5) and analog input channels (x2). Further, it is complemented by a complete real-time visualization and analysis software suite, providing access to raw data and real-time configurability on a mobile phone. Electrical characterization and multiple case studies confirm the platform's robustness, configurability, and suitability for real-world multimodal biosignal acquisition and edge intelligence. Finally, we demonstrate the system's versatility through integration into various wearable form factors: an EEG-PPG headband consuming 32.8 mW, an EMG sleeve at 26.7 mW, and an ECG-PPG chest band requiring only 9.3 mW, tailored for diverse biosignal applications. All hardware and software design files are also released open-source with a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design for RIS-Empowered NOMA-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and proposes a joint communication and sensing beamforming design based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. The system employs a dual-functional base station (DFBS) to simultaneously serve multiple users and sense multiple targets with the aid of RIS. To maximize the sum-rate of users, we jointly optimize the DFBS's active beamforming, the RIS's reflection coefficients, and the radar receive filters. The optimization is performed under constraints including the radar signal-to-noise ratio thresholds, the user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements, the phase shifts of the RIS, the total transmit power, the receive filters, and the successive interference cancellation decoding order. To tackle the complex interdependencies and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we introduce an effective iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms, highlighting its distinct advantages in the considered RIS-empowered NOMA-ISAC systems.</description>

Abstract: Mutual relative localization and identification is an important feature for the stabilization and navigation of multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. Camera-based communications technology, also referred to as Optical Camera Communications (OCC) in the literature, is a novel approach that could bring a valuable solution to such a complex task. In such system, the UAVs are equipped with LEDs that act as beacons and with cameras allowing them to locate the LEDs of other UAVs. Specific blinking sequences are assigned to the LEDs of each of the UAVs in order to uniquely identify them. This camera-based relative localization and identification system is immune to Radio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic interference and operates in Global Navigation satellite (GNSS) denied environments. In addition, since many UAVs are already equipped with cameras, the implementation of this system is inexpensive. In this article, we study in detail the capacity of this system and its limitations. Furthermore, we show how to construct blinking sequences for UAV LEDs in order to improve system performance. Finally, experimental results are presented to corroborate the analytical derivations.</description>

Abstract: Radio maps provide metrics such as the received signal strength at every location in a geographical region of interest. Extensive research has been carried out in this context, but it relies almost exclusively on synthetic-data experiments. Thus, the practical aspects of the radio map estimation (RME) problem as well as the performance of existing estimators in the real world remain unknown. To fill this gap end, this paper puts forth the first comprehensive, rigorous, and reproducible study of RME with real data. The main contributions include (C1) an assessment of the viability of RME based on the estimation error that can be achieved, (C2) the analysis of the main phenomena and trade-offs involved in RME, including the experimental verification of theoretical findings in the literature, and (C3) a thorough evaluation of a wide range of estimators on realworld data. Remarkably, this reveals that the performance gain of existing deep estimators in their pure form may not compensate for their complexity. A simple enhancement (C4) is proposed to alleviate this issue. The vast amount of data collected for this study is published along with the developed simulator to enable research on new schemes, hopefully bringing RME one step closer to practical deployment.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Solution for Kernel Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) uses a prescribed, positive-definite, nonlinear function to define the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where the minimum mean square error solution is found using search techniques. This paper proposes embedding the statistics of the input data in the kernel definition, obtaining a closed-form solution for nonlinear adaptive filtering applications. We call this solution the Functional Wiener Filter (FWF), which extends Parzen's work on the autocorrelation RKHS to nonlinear functional spaces. We first derive a space-time covariance operator on a RKHS that generalizes Parzen's autocovariance RKHS and includes nonlinear functions of a random process. We then present a method for approximating the FWF in an explicit, finite-dimensional RKHS to model time series. The FWF's computational complexity at test time is an improvement over other KAFs. We demonstrate how the difference equation learned by the FWF can be extracted, leading to system identification applications, beyond optimal nonlinear filtering.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel and Data Estimation for Multiuser Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) algorithm for uplink multiuser extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. The initial channel estimation is formulated as a sparse reconstruction problem based on the angle and distance sparsity under the near-field propagation condition. This problem is solved using non-orthogonal pilots through an efficient low complexity two-stage compressed sensing algorithm. Furthermore, the initial channel estimates are refined by employing a JCDE framework driven by both non-orthogonal pilots and estimated data. The JCDE problem is solved by sequential expectation propagation (EP) algorithms, where the channel and data are alternately updated in an iterative manner. In the channel estimation phase, integrating Bayesian inference with a model-based deterministic approach provides precise estimations to effectively exploit the near-field characteristics in the beam-domain. In the data estimation phase, a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based filter is designed at each sub-array to address the correlation due to energy leakage in the beam-domain arising from the near-field effects. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed initial channel estimation and JCDE algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of channel estimation, data detection, and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Age-Normalized HRV Features for Non-Invasive Glucose Prediction: A Pilot Sleep-Aware Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction, representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p = 0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.</description>

      <title>Environmental Feature Engineering and Statistical Validation for ML-Based Path Loss Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output (CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</description>

      <title>Speech Enhancement based on cascaded two flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) based on diffusion probabilistic models has exhibited impressive performance, while requiring a relatively high number of function evaluations (NFE). Recently, SE based on flow matching has been proposed, which showed competitive performance with a small NFE. Early approaches adopted the noisy speech as the only conditioning variable. There have been other approaches which utilize speech enhanced with a predictive model as another conditioning variable and to sample an initial value, but they require a separate predictive model on top of the generative SE model. In this work, we propose to employ an identical model based on flow matching for both SE and generating enhanced speech used as an initial starting point and a conditioning variable. Experimental results showed that the proposed method required the same or fewer NFEs even with two cascaded generative methods while achieving equivalent or better performances to the previous baselines.</description>
