      <title>Investigating the 1L2S Degeneracy for Wide-Orbit Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-orbit planets are particularly sensitive to detection by the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). This study investigates the degeneracy of these events with binary sources, focusing on how observation cadence affects the resolution of these degeneracies. We analyzed the impact of various cadences from (3.6 min)^(-1) to (5 hr)^(-1), which encompasses planned cadences for both the GBTDS and cadences used by ground-based surveys like KMTNet. The results show that a $\sim (15 min)^(-1) cadence is generally sufficient to resolve this degeneracy unless the source star is a giant (rho &gt;~ 0.01).</description>

      <title>Planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn: Vortices as planetary nurseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass, metal-enriched stars were likely present as early as cosmic dawn. In this work, we investigate whether these stars could have hosted planets in their protoplanetary disks. If so, these would have been the first planets to form in the Universe, emerging in systems with metallicities much lower than solar. In the core accretion model, planetesimals serve as the building blocks of planets, meaning that planetesimal formation is a prerequisite for planet formation. In a non-structured disk, planetesimal formation typically requires near-solar metallicities according to our current understanding. However, mechanisms that concentrate solid material can significantly lower this metallicity threshold. Here, we explore whether vortices can facilitate the formation of the first planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn. Vortices are prime sites for planetesimal formation due to their ability to efficiently trap and concentrate dust. We conduct simulations spanning a range of metallicities, and identify a metallicity threshold at Z &gt;=~ 0.04 Zsun for planetesimal formation. If these planetesimals remain inside the vortex long enough to accrete the remaining trapped solids, Mercury-mass planets can form. The formation of Mars-mass planets or larger requires a metallicity of Z &gt;=~ 0.08 Zsun. These results assume a low level of disk turbulence, with higher turbulence levels leading to higher metallicity thresholds.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Spitzer Phase Curves for WASP-121b and WASP-77Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analyses of Spitzer InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m phase curve observations of hot Jupiters WASP-77Ab and WASP-121b. For WASP-121b, we find amplitudes of 1771 $\pm$ 95 ppm (3.6 $\mu$m) and 2048 $\pm$ 109 ppm (4.5 $\mu$m), and near-zero offsets of -0.78 $\pm$ 1.87$^{\circ}$ (3.6 $\mu$m) and 0.42 $\pm$ 1.74$^{\circ}$ (4.5 $\mu$m), consistent within 2.2$\sigma$ and 1.3$\sigma$, respectively, with JWST NIRSpec results. For WASP-77Ab, we find amplitudes of 535 $\pm$ 52 ppm (3.6 $\mu$m) and 919 $\pm$ 40 ppm (4.5 $\mu$m), and offsets of 33.45 $\pm$ 2.79$^{\circ}$ (3.6 $\mu$m) and 16.28 $\pm$ 2.52$^{\circ}$ (4.5 $\mu$m). We report day- and nightside brightness temperatures: for WASP-121b, 2779 $\pm$ 40 K (3.6 $\mu$m) and 2905 $\pm$ 51 K (4.5 $\mu$m) (day) and 1259 $\pm$ 67 K (3.6 $\mu$m) and 1349 $\pm$ 54 K (4.5 $\mu$m) (night), and for WASP-77Ab, 1876 $\pm$ 23 K (3.6 $\mu$m) and 1780 $\pm$ 25 K (day) and 1501 $\pm$ 22 K (3.6 $\mu$m) and 1234 $\pm$ 20 K (4.5 $\mu$m) (night). Comparing WASP-121b data to general circulation models, we find evidence for drag inhibiting day-to-night heat transfer, which our model reproduces using magnetic circulation. Further, comparing both planets' data to Energy Balance Models, we show suppressed circulation in WASP-121b and potential evidence for an unusually high Bond albedo in WASP-77Ab. We add both planets to the Spitzer population study of previously identified trends in offset versus orbital period, finding that a positive trend is weakened, but not eliminated, by including these planets.</description>

      <title>Two Possible Orbital Histories of Phobos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, have orbits that are close to martian equator, indicating their formation from a circumplanetary disk. Phobos is currently migrating toward Mars due to tidal dissipation within the planet, and may be disrupted into a ring in few tens of Myr. The past evolution of Phobos is not fully understood, with one possibility being that Phobos formed in the early Solar System just interior to the synchronous orbit and migrated inward over several Gyr. Alternatively, Phobos may be the most recent product of an ongoing martian ring-moon cycle that lasted several Gyr but formed Phobos only 100 Myr ago at the fluid Roche limit. Here we use numerical integrations to simulate past evolution of Phobos in both of these scenarios and test whether Phobos's small eccentricity and inclination are consistent with either of these hypotheses. During its tidal evolution, Phobos crossed multiple resonances with both the rotation of Mars and the apparent motion of the Sun, requiring detailed numerical modeling of these dynamical events. Furthermore, Phobos crossed resonances with Deimos, which can affect the orbit of Deimos. We find that both the ancient Phobos hypothesis and the ring-moon cycle are fully consistent with the present orbit of Phobos, with no currently available means of distinguishing between these very different dynamical histories. Furthermore, we find that Deimos is affected by weak chaos caused by secular resonances with the planetary system, making the eccentricity of Deimos an ineffective constraint on the past migration of Phobos.</description>

      <title>An Early Look at the Performance of IGRINS-2 at Gemini-North with Application to the ultrahot Jupiter, WASP-33 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12736v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy enables precise molecular detections, and velocity-resolved atmospheric dynamics, offering a distinct advantage over low-resolution methods for exoplanetary atmospheric studies. IGRINS-2, the successor to IGRINS, features improved throughput and enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide by shifting its $\textit{K}$-band coverage by ~36 nm to longer wavelengths. To evaluate its performance, we attempt to investigate the atmospheric characteristics of WASP-33 b. Observations were conducted on 2024 January 7 for a total of 2.43 hours; This includes 1.46 hours in the pre-eclipse phase to capture the planet's thermal emission spectrum. Our analysis, employing a composite atmospheric model, confirms the presence of a thermally inverted atmosphere on the planet's dayside with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.5. More specifically, we capture CO, H$_{2}$O, and OH with SNRs of 5.2, 4.2, and 4.4, respectively. These results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that IGRINS-2 is well-suited for detailed investigation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We anticipate that future observations with IGRINS-2 will further advance our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The effect of stellar evolution on dispersal of protoplanetary disks: Disk fraction in star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of stellar evolution on the dispersal of protoplanatary disks by performing one-dimensional simulations of long-term disk evolution. Our simulations include viscous disk accretion, magnetohydrodynamic winds, and photoevaporation as important disk dispersal processes. We consider a wide range of stellar mass of $0.1$ - $7M_{\odot}$, and incorporate the luminosity evolution of the central star. For solar-mass stars, stellar evolution delays the disk dispersal time as the FUV luminosity decreases toward the main sequence. In the case of intermediate-mass stars, the FUV luminosity increases significantly over a few million years, driving strong photoevaporation and enhancing disk mass loss during the later stages of disk evolution. This highlights the limitations of assuming a constant FUV luminosity throughout a simulation. Photoevaporation primarily impacts the outer regions of the disk and is the dominant disk dispersal process in the late evolutionary stage. Based on the results of a large set of simulations, we study the evolution of a population of star-disk systems and derive the disk fraction as a function of time. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stellar luminosity evolution can alter the disk fraction by several tens of percent, bringing the simulations into closer agreement with recent observations. We argue that it is important to include the stellar luminosity evolution in simulations of the long-term dispersal of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Gravito-turbulent bi-fluid protoplanetary discs: 1. An analytical perspective to stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In Class 0/I and the outskirts of Class II circumstellar discs, the self-gravity of gas significantly affects the disc's vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The contribution of dust, whose measured mass is still uncertain, could influence this equilibrium. Aims. We aim to formulate and solve approximately the equations governing the hydrostatic equilibrium of a self-gravitating disc composed of gas and dust. Particularly, we aim to provide a fully consistent treatment of turbulence and gravity, affecting almost symmetrically gas and dust. Observationally, we study the possibility of indirectly measuring disc masses through gas layering and dust settling measurements. Methods. We used analytical methods to approximate the solution of the 1D Liouville equation with additional non-linearities governing the stratification of a self-gravitating protoplanetary disc. The findings were verified numerically and validated through physical interpretation. Results. For a constant vertical stopping time profile, we discovered a nearly exact layering solution valid across all self-gravity regimes for gas and dust. From first principles, we defined the Toomre parameter of a bi-fluid system as the harmonic average of its constituents' Toomre parameters. Based on these findings, we propose a method to estimate disc mass through gas or dust settling observations. We introduce a generic definition of the dust-to-gas scale height, applicable to complex profiles. We also identified new exact solutions for benchmarking self-gravity solvers in numerical codes. Conclusions. The hydrostatic equilibrium of a gas/dust mixture is governed by their Toomre parameters and effective relative temperature. This equilibrium could be used for measuring disc masses, improving our understanding of disc settling and gravitational collapse, and enhancing the computation of self-gravity in thin disc simulations.</description>

      <title>Solar System objects observed with TESS -- Early Data Release 2: I. Spin-shape recovery potential of multi-epoch TESS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multidirectional measurements from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we investigated the viability of determining the approximate shape and spin axis orientations for 44 selected main belt asteroids, using light curve inversion, assuming Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoids. This study aims to investigate the applicability of low-degree-of-freedom shape models in those cases when rotation periods can be accurately determined, but light curves are only available in a limited number of geometries or orbital phases. Our results are compared with the shape and spin axis solutions obtained for the same set of asteroids by more complex light curve inversion methods using mainly ground-based measurements, available via the Database of Asteroid Models from Inversion Techniques (DAMIT).The best-fit spin-axis orientations show a moderately good match with the DAMIT solutions; however, a better agreement is reached with triaxial ellipsoid solution obtained from other large, independent surveys. This suggests that while TESS-only data works well for finding rotation periods, it has its limitations when determining asteroid shape and spin-axis orientation. We discuss the challenges and potential applications of this approach for studying large number of asteroids observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stellar Flares on the Atmospheric Escape of Exoplanets orbiting M stars I: Insights from the AU Mic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-rays and Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) emission from M stars can drive the atmospheric escape on planets orbiting them. M stars are also known for their frequent emission of stellar flares, which will increase the high-energy flux received by their orbiting planets. To understand how stellar flares impact the primordial atmospheres of planets orbiting young M stars, we use UV spectroscopic data of flares from the Habitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time (HAZMAT) and Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) programs as a proxy to the XUV flare emission. Using the software package VPLanet, we simulate the young AU Mic planetary system composed of two Neptune-sized and one Earth-sized planet orbiting a 23-Myr-old M1 star. Our findings show that the Earth-sized planet AU Mic d should be in the process of losing completely its atmosphere in the next couple million years, solely due to the quiescent emission, with flares not significantly contributing to its atmospheric escape due to the small size of AU mic d and its close-in distance from the star. However, our results indicate that flares would play a crucial role for such planets further away, in the habitable zone (i.e. 0.2935 AU) of AU Mic-like stars during the post-saturation phase, accelerating the total atmospheric loss process by a few billion years. For planets between 0.365 AU and the HZ outer edge, the additional XUV from flares is necessary to deplete primordial atmospheres fully since the quiescent emission alone is insufficient.</description>

      <title>Asteroid (4337) Arecibo: Two ice-rich bodies forming a binary -- Based on Gaia astrometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Binary asteroids are present in all populations of the Solar System, from near-Earth to trans-Neptunian regions. As is true for the small Solar System bodies (SSSBs), binary asteroids generally offer valuable insights into the formation of the Solar System, as well as its collisions and dynamic evolution. In particular, the binaries provide fundamental quantities and properties of these SSSBs, such as mass, angular momentum, and density, all of which are often hidden. The direct measurement of densities and porosities is of great value in revealing the gravitational aggregates and icy bodies that form the asteroid-comet continuum. Aims. Several observation techniques from space and ground-based platforms have provided many results in this regard. Here we show the value of the Gaia mission and its high-precision astrometry for analysing asteroid binaries and for individually deriving the masses of the components. Methods. We focus on the binary asteroid (4337) Arecibo, a member of the Themis family. We analysed the astrometry obtained in the Gaia FPR catalogue release, and performed orbital fitting for both the heliocentric orbit of the system and the relative orbit of the binary components. Results. We obtain an estimation of the component masses and their flux ratio, and derive bulk densities rho1 = 1.2 and rho2 = 1.6 for the primary and the secondary, respectively. The results are consistent with an ice-rich body in the outer main belt. They also show a significantly denser secondary or a less closely packed primary. Constraints on these densities and on macroscopic porosities are nevertheless limited by our poor knowledge of the sizes of the components. Observations of future mutual events, and of stellar occultations predicted in 2024 - 2025, will be essential for improving our knowledge of this system and its formation.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of Galilei's observations of Jupiter satellites from the Sidereus Nuncius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the observations of the satellites of Jupiter from the Sidereus Nuncius (January 7 to March 1, 1610) and compare them to the predictions obtained using a modern sky simulator, verifying them one by one. A sinusoidal fit of the data obtained from the 64 available sketches, allows measuring the relative major semi-axes of the satellites' orbits and their periods with a statistical precision of 2-4\% and 0.1-0.3\% respectively. The periods are basically unbiased while the orbits tend to be underestimated for Callisto by about 12\%. The posterior fit error indicates that the positions of the satellites are determined with a resolution of 0.4-0.6 Jupiter diameters in the notation of Galilei corresponding to about 40- 70 arc sec i.e. similar to the true angular diameter of Jupiter, in those days. We show that with this data one can infer in a convincing way the third law of Kepler for the Jupiter system. The 1:2 and 1:4 orbital resonance between the periods of Io and Europa/Ganymede can be determined with \% precision. In order to obtain these results it is important to separate the four datasets. This operation, which is nowadays simple using a sky simulator, and is fully reported in this work, was an extremely difficult task for Galilei as the analysis will evidence. Nevertheless we show how the four periods might have been extracted using the modern Lomb-Scargle technique without having to separate the four data-sets already just using these early observations. We also perform a critical evaluation of the accuracy of the observation of the Pleiades and other clusters and the Moon.</description>

Abstract: The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The resuls indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Tidally Heated Sub-Neptunes, Refined Planetary Compositions, and Confirmation of a Third Planet in the TOI-1266 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16374</link>

Abstract: TOI-1266 is a benchmark system of two temperate ($&lt;$ 450 K) sub-Neptune-sized planets orbiting a nearby M dwarf exhibiting a rare inverted architecture with a larger interior planet. In this study, we characterize transit timing variations (TTVs) in the TOI-1266 system using high-precision ground-based follow-up and new TESS data. We confirm the presence of a third exterior non-transiting planet, TOI-1266 d (P = 32.5 d, $M_d$ = 3.68$^{+1.05}_{-1.11} M_{\oplus}$), and combine the TTVs with archival radial velocity (RV) measurements to improve our knowledge of the planetary masses and radii. We find that, consistent with previous studies, TOI-1266 b ($R_b$ = 2.52 $\pm$ 0.08 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_b$ = 4.46 $\pm$ 0.69 $M_{\oplus}$) has a low bulk density requiring the presence of a hydrogen-rich envelope, while TOI-1266 c ($R_c$ = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_c$ = 3.17 $\pm$ 0.76 $M_{\oplus}$) has a higher bulk density that can be matched by either a hydrogen-rich or water-rich envelope. Our new dynamical model reveals that this system is arranged in a rare configuration with the inner and outer planets located near the 3:1 period ratio with a non-resonant planet in between them. Our dynamical fits indicate that the inner and outer planet have significantly nonzero eccentricities ($e_b + e_d = 0.076^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$), suggesting that TOI-1266 b may have an inflated envelope due to tidal heating. Finally, we explore the corresponding implications for the formation and long-term evolution of the system, which contains two of the most favorable cool ($&lt;$ 500 K) sub-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization with JWST.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Results from NASA's First Radio Telescope on the Moon: Terrestrial Technosignatures and the Low-Frequency Galactic Background Observed by ROLSES-1 Onboard the Odysseus Lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09842</link>

Abstract: Radiowave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photo-Electron Sheath instrument (ROLSES- 1) onboard the Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lunar lander represents NASA's first radio telescope on the Moon, and the first United States spacecraft landing on the lunar surface in five decades. Despite a host of challenges, ROLSES-1 managed to collect a small amount of data over fractions of one day during cruise phase and two days on the lunar surface with four monopole stacer antennas that were in a non-ideal deployment. All antennas recorded shortwave radio transmissions breaking through the Earth's ionosphere -- or terrestrial technosignatures -- from spectral and raw waveform data. These technosignatures appear to be modulated by density fluctuations in the Earth's ionosphere and could be used as markers when searching for extraterrestrial intelligence from habitable exoplanets. After data reduction and marshaling a host of statistical and sampling techniques, five minutes of raw waveforms from the least noisy antenna were used to generate covariances constraining both the antenna parameters and the amplitude of the low-frequency isotropic galactic spectrum. ROLSES- 2 and LuSEE-Night, both lunar radio telescopes launching later in the decade, will have significant upgrades from ROLSES-1 and will be set to take unprecedented measurements of the low-frequency sky, lunar surface, and constrain the cosmological 21-cm signal. ROLSES-1 represents a trailblazer for lunar radio telescopes, and many of the statistical tools and data reduction techniques presented in this work will be invaluable for upcoming lunar radio telescope missions.</description>
