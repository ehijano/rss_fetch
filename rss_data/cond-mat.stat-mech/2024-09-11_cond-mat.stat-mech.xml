      <title>Noisy Quantum Dynamics and Measurement Induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent results in the context of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum systems, with a particular focus on hybrid quantum circuits as a model system in one dimension. Our analysis shows how varying the rate of projective measurements can induce phase transitions, resulting in abrupt changes in the properties of the entanglement. Through mappings to classical statistical models and the application of replica field theory techniques, we investigate the interplay between unitary evolution and measurement processes. Starting from a low entangled state, we identify three regimes characterized by different dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropies for a portion of the system: high-rate measurements leading to rapid entanglement saturation (area law), low-rate measurements allowing linear entanglement growth (up to volume law), and a critical rate at which entanglement grows logarithmically. As a complementary subject, we explore the non-local effects of local measurements by examining the field theory of critical ground states in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity in open quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) through counterdiabatic driving in quantum critical systems, in the presence of dissipation. We evaluate unitary as well as non-unitary controls, such that the system density matrix follows a prescribed trajectory corresponding to the eigenstates of a time-dependent reference Hamiltonian, at any instant of time. The strength of the dissipator control term for the low energy states show universal scaling close to criticality. Using the example of the transverse-field Ising model, we show that in contrast to STA in closed quantum critical systems, here STA may require multi-body interactions terms, even away from criticality, owing to change in entropy of the time-dependent target state. Further, the associated heat current shows extremum, while power dissipated changes curvature, close to criticality, and analogous to unitary control, no operational cost is associated with implementation of the exact counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. We expect the counterdiabatic protocol studied here can be of fundamental importance for understanding STA in many-body open quantum systems, and can be highly relevant for varied topics involving open many-body quantum systems, such as quantum computation and many-body quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dimer Angles on the Silicon Surface: Critical Properties and the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics simulations are used to analyze the static and dynamic properties of an XY model adapted to dimers forming on Si(001) surfaces. The numerics utilise high-performance parallel computation methods on GPUs. The static exponent $\nu$ of the symmetry-broken XY model is determined to $\nu = 1.04$. The dynamic critical exponent $z$ is determined to $z=2.13$ and, together with $\nu$, shows the behavior of the Ising universality class. For time-dependent temperatures, we observe frozen domains and compare their size distribution with predictions from Kibble-Zurek theory. We determine a significantly larger quench exponent that shows little dependence on the damping or the symmetry-breaking field.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of the ground-state energy of potentials with weak disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P(E)$ of the ground-state energy of a single quantum particle in a potential $V(\bf x) = V_0(\bf x) + \sqrt{\epsilon} \, V_1(\bf x)$, where $V_0(\bf x)$ is a deterministic "background" trapping potential and $V_1(\bf x)$ is the disorder. In the weak-disorder limit $\epsilon \to 0$, we find that $P(E)$ scales as $P(E) \sim e^{-s(E)/\epsilon}$. The large-deviation function $s(E)$ is obtained by calculating the most likely configuration of $V(\bf x)$ conditioned on a given ground-state energy $E$. We consider arbitrary trapping potentials $V_0(\bf x)$ and white-noise disorder $V_1(\bf x)$. For infinite systems, we obtain $s(E)$ analytically in the limits $E \to \pm \infty$ and $E \simeq E_0$ where $E_0$ is the ground-state energy in the absence of disorder. We perform explicit calculations for the case of a harmonic trap $V_0(\bf x) \propto x^2$. Next, we calculate $s(E)$ exactly for a finite, periodic one-dimensional system with a homogeneous background $V_0(x)=0$. We find that, remarkably, the system exhibits a sudden change of behavior as $E$ crosses a critical value $E_c &lt; 0$: At $E&gt;E_c$, the most likely configuration of $V(x)$ is homogeneous, whereas at $E &lt; E_c$ it is inhomogeneous, thus spontaneously breaking the translational symmetry of the problem. As a result, $s(E)$ is nonanalytic: Its second derivative jumps at $E=E_c$. We interpret this singularity as a second-order dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Thermalization is typical in large classical and quantum harmonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. Our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on observables dependent on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Typicality, entropy and the generalization of statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When at equilibrium, large-scale systems obey conventional thermodynamics because they belong to microscopic configurations (or states) that are typical. Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states -- the typical set -- alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system's statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the "thermalized" coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Renyi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold.</description>

      <title>Tensor network Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered lattice spin systems are crucial in both theoretical and applied physics. However, understanding their properties poses significant challenges for Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model using the recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method. This method generates biased samples from conditional probabilities computed via tensor network contractions and corrects the bias using the Metropolis scheme. Consequently, the proposals provided by tensor networks function as block updates for Monte Carlo simulations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that TNMC simulations can be performed on lattices as large as $1024\times 1024$ spins with moderate computational resources, a substantial increase from the previous maximum size of $64\times 64$ in MCMC. Notably, we observe an almost complete absence of critical slowing down, enabling the efficient collection of unbiased samples and averaging over a large number of random realizations of bond disorders. We successfully pinpoint the multi-critical point along the Nishimori line with significant precision and accurately determined the bulk and surface critical exponents. Our findings suggest that TNMC is a highly efficient algorithm for exploring disordered and frustrated systems in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: i) they are integrable via mapping to second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases) it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of finite time path field theory based on Wigner transforms of projected functions, we show how to: i) calculate the basic "bubble" diagram in the Loschmidt echo of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; ii) resum the generalized Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion two point retarded functions in the "bubble" diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of Loschmidt echo for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analiticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Statistics of Classical Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical nonlinear dynamical systems are often characterized by their steady-state probability distribution functions (PDFs). Typically, PDFs are accumulated from numerical simulations that involve solving the underlying dynamical equations of motion using integration techniques. An alternative procedure, direct statistical simulation (DSS), solves for the statistics directly. One approach to DSS is the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), which can be used to find the PDF of classical dynamical systems. Here, we investigate the utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers to find steady-state solutions to the FPE. We employ the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms to find the zero-mode of the FPE for one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck problems enabling comparison with exact solutions. The quantum computed steady-state probability distribution functions (PDFs) are demonstrated to be in reasonable agreement with the classically computed PDFs. We conclude with a discussion of potential extensions to higher-dimensional dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalized thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we show that the classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-integrated rate of information change also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.</description>

      <title>Steady-state entanglement scaling in open quantum systems: A comparison between several master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling of the fermionic logarithmic negativity (FLN) between complementary intervals in the steady state of a driven-dissipative tight-binding critical chain, coupled to two thermal reservoirs at its edges. We compare the predictions of three different master equations, namely a nonlocal Lindblad equation, the Redfield equation, and the recently proposed universal Lindblad equation (ULE). Within the nonlocal Lindblad equation approach, the FLN grows logarithmically with the subsystem size $\ell$, for any value of the system-bath coupling and of the bath parameters. This is consistent with the logarithmic scaling of the mutual information analytically demonstrated in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 235149 (2022)]. In the ultraweak-coupling regime, the Redfield equation and the ULE exhibit the same logarithmic increase; such behavior holds even when moving to moderately weak coupling and intermediate values of $\ell$. However, when venturing beyond this regime, the FLN crosses over to superlogarithmic scaling for both equations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Map for Slow Collective Variables, Markovian Dynamics, and Transition State Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of complex molecular systems is a fundamental problem in physical chemistry. To describe the long-time dynamics of such systems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we can identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining fast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and treat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs, effectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning technique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22, 5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral gap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements into our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a protein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov transition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and use it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by spectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion. We demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly affect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral map can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs with structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we demonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a physical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein folding.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of ordered self-assembled structures in the liquid phase of a hard-core, square-shoulder system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering (pattern formation) of systems of two-dimensional core-shell particles using Monte-Carlo (MC) computer simulations and classical density functional theory (DFT). The particles interact via a pair potential having a hard core and a repulsive square shoulder. Our simulations show that on cooling, the liquid state structure becomes increasingly characterised by long wavelength density modulations, and on further cooling forms a variety of other phases, including clustered, striped and other patterned phases. In DFT, the hard core part of the potential is treated using either fundamental measure theory or a simple local density approximation, whereas the soft shoulder is treated using the random phase approximation. The different DFTs are bench-marked using large-scale grand-canonical-MC and Gibbs-ensemble-MC simulations, demonstrating their predictive capabilities and shortcomings. We find that having the liquid state static structure factor $S(k)$ for wavenumber $k$ is sufficient to identify the Fourier modes governing both the liquid and solid phases. This allows to identify from easier-to-obtain liquid state data the wavenumbers relevant to the periodic phases and to predict roughly where in the phase diagram these patterned phases arise.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-time Mpemba effect in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various exotic phenomena emerge in non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. The Mpemba effect, denoting the situation where a hot system freezes faster than the colder one, is a counterintuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon that has attracted enduring interest for more than half a century. In this Letter, we report a novel phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in quantum many-body systems, dubbed as imaginary-time Mpemba effect (ITME). Through numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulation, we unambiguously demonstrate that in different classes of interacting quantum models, the initial states with higher energy are relaxed faster than lower-energy initial states in the process of imaginary-time relaxation. The emergence of ITME is intimately associated with the low-energy excitations in quantum many-body systems. More crucially, since imaginary-time dynamics is broadly applied in numerical simulation on the quantum many-body ground states, the discovery of ITME potentially provides a new pathway to expedite the quantum many-body computation, particularly for QMC involving the sign problem.</description>

      <title>A classical density functional theory for solvation across length scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach builds on the Lum-Chandler-Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [K. Lum et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, by assessing the local compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our approach is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-time transient dynamical phase transition (SDQPT), serving as the theoretical framework on far-from-equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems, has been experimentally observed recently. However, the existence of different types of SDQPTs and the associated conditions are yet to be elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively classify SDQPTs by considering the one-dimensional transverse field quantum XY model initialized in the ground state. We find that there are only six types of SDQPTs, and three of which are completely new that had not yet been identified previously. The associated conditions for different SDQPTs are discussed in detail, and based on this, the dynamical phase diagrams are given. Our analytical method used to classify SDQPTs in one-dimensional transverse field quantum XY model can be applied to any other two-band models in one- and two-spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Tradeoff relations in open quantum dynamics via Robertson, Maccone-Pati, and Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, together with Robertson's generalisation, serves as a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, showing that noncommutative pairs of observables cannot be measured precisely. In this study, we explore the Robertson-type uncertainty relations to demonstrate their effectiveness in establishing a series of thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits in open quantum dynamics. The derivation utilises a scaled continuous matrix product state representation that maps the time evolution of the quantum continuous measurement to the time evolution of the system and field. Specifically, we consider the Maccone-Pati uncertainty relation, a refinement of the Robertson uncertainty relation, to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits. These newly derived relations, which use a state orthogonal to the initial state, yield bounds that are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we consider the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty, which extends the Robertson uncertainty relation. Our findings not only reinforce the significance of the Robertson-type uncertainty relations, but also expand its applicability in identifying uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in phase ordering: the roles of activity, noise, and non-constant mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity emerges generically in the coarsening regime of phase-separating fluids. Numerical studies of active and passive systems have shown that the structure factor $S(q)$ behaves as $q^\varsigma$ for $q\to 0$, with hyperuniformity exponent $\varsigma = 4$. For passive systems, this result was explained in 1991 by a qualitative scaling analysis of Tomita, exploiting isotropy at scales much larger than the coarsening length $\ell$. Here we reconsider and extend Tomita's argument to address cases of active phase separation and of non-constant mobility, again finding $\varsigma=4$. We further show that dynamical noise of variance $D$ creates a transient $\varsigma = 2$ regime for $\hat q\ll \hat{q}_\ast \sim \sqrt{D} t^{[1-(d+2)\nu]/2}$, crossing over to $\varsigma = 4$ at larger $\hat{q}$. Here, $\nu$ is the coarsening exponent, with $\ell\sim t^\nu$, and $\hat{q} \propto q \ell$ is the rescaled wavenumber. In diffusive coarsening, $\nu=1/3$, so the rescaled crossover wavevector $\hat{q}_\ast$ vanishes at large times when $d\geq 2$. The slowness of this decay suggests a natural explanation for experiments that observe a long-lived $\varsigma = 2$ scaling in phase-separating active fluids (where noise is typically large). Conversely, in $d=1$, we demonstrate that with noise the $\varsigma = 2$ regime survives as $t\to\infty$, with $\hat{q}_\ast\sim D^{5/6}$. (The structure factor is not then determined by the zero-temperature fixed point.) We confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of active and passive continuum theories in the deterministic case and of Model B for the stochastic case. We also compare them with related findings for a system near an absorbing-state transition rather than undergoing phase separation. A central role is played throughout by the presence or absence of a conservation law for the centre of mass position of the order parameter field.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Maze: A System With Tunable Scale Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random magnetic field configurations are ubiquitous in nature. Such fields lead to a variety of dynamical phenomena, including localization and glassy physics in some condensed matter systems and novel transport processes in astrophysical systems. Here we consider the physics of a charged quantum particle moving in a ``magnetic maze'': a high-dimensional space filled with a randomly chosen vector potential and a corresponding magnetic field. We derive a path integral description of the model by introducing appropriate collective variables and integrating out the random vector potential, and we solve for the dynamics in the limit of large dimensionality. We derive and analyze the equations of motion for Euclidean and real-time dynamics, and we calculate out-of-time-order correlators. We show that a special choice of vector potential correlations gives rise, in the low temperature limit, to a novel scale-invariant quantum theory with a tunable dynamical exponent. Moreover, we show that the theory is chaotic with a tunable chaos exponent which approaches the chaos bound at low temperature and strong coupling.</description>
