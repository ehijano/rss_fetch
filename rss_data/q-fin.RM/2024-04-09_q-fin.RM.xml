      <title>The PEAL Method: a mathematical framework to streamline securitization structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securitization is a financial process where the cash flows of income-generating assets are sold to institutional investors as securities, liquidating illiquid assets. This practice presents persistent challenges due to the absence of a comprehensive mathematical framework for structuring asset-backed securities. While existing literature provides technical analysis of credit risk modeling, there remains a need for a definitive framework detailing the allocation of the inbound cash flows to the outbound positions. To fill this gap, we introduce the PEAL Method: a 10-step mathematical framework to streamline the securitization structuring across all time periods.
  The PEAL Method offers a rigorous and versatile approach, allowing practitioners to structure various types of securitizations, including those with complex vertical positions. By employing standardized equations, it facilitates the delineation of payment priorities and enhances risk characterization for both the asset and the liability sides throughout the securitization life cycle.
  In addition to its technical contributions, the PEAL Method aims to elevate industry standards by addressing longstanding challenges in securitization. By providing detailed information to investors and enabling transparent risk profile comparisons, it promotes market transparency and enables stronger regulatory oversight.
  In summary, the PEAL Method represents a significant advancement in securitization literature, offering a standardized framework for precision and efficiency in structuring transactions. Its adoption has the potential to drive innovation and enhance risk management practices in the securitization market.</description>

      <title>The credit spread curve. I: Fundamental concepts, fitting, par-adjusted spread, and expected return</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a credit spread curve is fundamental in fixed income investing, but in practice it is not `given' and needs to be constructed from bond prices either for a particular issuer, or for a sector rating-by-rating. Rather than attempting to fit spreads -- and as we discuss here, the Z-spread is unsuitable -- we fit parametrised survival curves. By deriving a valuation formula for a risky bond, we explain and avoid the problem that bonds with a high dollar price trade at a higher yield or spread than those with low dollar price (at the same maturity point), even though they do not necessarily offer better value. In fact, a concise treatment of this effect is elusive, and much of the academic literature on risky bond pricing, including a well-known paper by Duffie and Singleton (1997), is fundamentally incorrect. We then proceed to show how to calculate carry, rolldown and relative value for bonds/CDS. Also, once curve construction has been programmed and automated we can run it historically and assess the way a curve has moved over time. This provides the necessary grounding for econometric and arbitrage-free models of curve dynamics, which will be pursued in later work, as well as assessing how the perceived relative value of a particular instrument varies over time.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity Limits Accuracy of Price Probability Predictions by Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the economic reasons why the predictions of price and return statistical moments in the coming decades, in the best case, will be limited by their averages and volatilities. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of price and return probabilities by Gaussian distributions. The economic origin of these restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the market-based n-th statistical moments of price and return for n=1,2,.., require the description of the economic variables of the n-th order that are determined by sums of the n-th degrees of values or volumes of market trades. The lack of existing models that describe the evolution of the economic variables determined by the sums of the 2nd degrees of market trades results in the fact that even predictions of the volatilities of price and return are very uncertain. One can ignore existing economic barriers that we highlight but cannot overcome or resolve them. The accuracy of predictions of price and return probabilities substantially determines the reliability of asset pricing models and portfolio theories. The restrictions on the accuracy of predictions of price and return statistical moments reduce the reliability and veracity of modern asset pricing and portfolio theories.</description>
