      <title>The distribution of violent events and interevent times in conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violent conflicts are interrupted by intervals without violence. These interevent times are said have a power law distribution, but this is only true for coarse grained data, typically with a resolution of one day. For fine grained data, with a resolution of milliseconds, the distribution is lognormal. By representing conflicts as a multiplicative process, it becomes clear why these two different distributions are found.</description>

      <title>The Preponderance of Electric Vehicles and the Availability of Green Electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main advantage of electric vehicles, namely, their non-polluting operation, is compromised when the electricity they use comes from burning fossil fuels. The number of electric vehicles on the road is growing much faster than the amount of green electricity produced. It is forecasted that in 2037 the number of electric vehicles on the road will need an amount of electricity equal to the entire green electricity produced at that time. Therefore, green operation of electric vehicles entering the market after 2037 will be impossible. The sales of hydrogen-burning vehicles are poised to overtake the sales of electric vehicles in 2041, but a non-polluting overall operation for them is not guaranteed either at this time.</description>

      <title>Balancing Act: The Cost of Wind Restrictions in Norway's Electricity Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement and reduce its dependency on energy imports, the pace, and scale of renewable energy deployment across Europe must increase dramatically over the next decade. Such a steep change in the net-zero transition will inevitably necessitate trade-offs with other societal priorities. Here we investigate a case study focused on the opposition towards onshore wind and the compromises that may need to be made to deliver its plans for deep electrification. Using an electricity system model, we explore the implications of key social and environmental dimensions shaping the future deployment of onshore wind on the costs and design of electricity systems for Norway in 2030. We find that under restrictions that allow for almost no additional onshore wind, demand can not be met and load has to be shed. Yet, when reducing the restrictions on onshore wind or allowing for in-country transmission expansion, feasible system designs at a small fraction of that cost can be found. To meet the net-zero targets, compromises will need to be made on either wind power deployment, transmission expansion, non-electrification of industry or demand reduction.</description>

      <title>Crime Hotspot Analysis and Mapping Using Geospatial Technology in Dessie City, Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, crime and delinquency rates have increased drastically in many countries; nevertheless, it is important to note that crime trends can differ significantly by geographic region. This study's primary goal was to use geographic technology to map and analyze Dessie City's crime patterns. To investigate the geographic clustering of crime, the researchers used semivariogram modeling and spatial autocorrelation analysis with Moran'sI. The neighborhoods of Hote, Arada, and Segno in Dessie's central city were found to be crime-prone "hot spot" locations, as evidenced by statistically significant high Z-scores ranging from 0.037 to 4.608. On the other hand, low negative Z-scores ranging from -3.231 to -0.116 indicated "cold spot" concentrations of crime in the city's north-central sub-cities of Menafesha and Bounbouwha. With an index of 0.027492 and a Z-score of 3.297616 (p&lt;0.01), the analysis overall showed a substantial positive spatial autocorrelation, suggesting a clustered pattern of crime in Dessie. The majority of crimes showed a north-south directionality, except for murder, which trended from northeast to southwest. The mean center of all crime types was found in the central Hote area. To address the complicated problem of rising crime rates in Dessie and other developing metropolitan areas, more focused and efficient enforcement techniques, and resource deployment can be informed through the knowledge acquired from the geospatial analysis.</description>

      <title>Recursive introversion, iterative extroversion and transitive ambiversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an approach to describing personality dynamics through mathematical modelling of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion processes. Introversion is interpreted as a recursive process characterized by deep self-awareness and inner reflection; extroversion is presented as an iterative process of accumulating and processing external stimuli; and ambiversion is considered transitivity, integrating the interaction of these two opposing processes. The developed model is based on principles of complex systems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and synergetics, enabling the perception of personality as an adaptive and multilayered system.
  The results include analytical equations describing the interaction of internal and external factors. Parameters regulating personality dynamics, such as sensitivity coefficients, weighting factors of stimuli, and synergy parameters, are also explored.
  The practical significance of the proposed model lies in its application in psychotherapy, education, personnel management, and other areas where it is necessary to consider personality traits and their dynamics. The model provides new opportunities for diagnosing, forecasting, and correcting personality changes, enhancing methods of working with individuals.
  The findings open some prospects for quantitative personality analysis, providing a theoretical understanding of its structure and dynamics. They also create a foundation for further interdisciplinary research in psychology, the cognitive sciences, and social systems.
  Specifically, the formalization considered in the context of program algorithms allows for the creation of functional procedures for AI and robots with differentiated psychological archetypes (introvert robots, extrovert robots, and ambivert robots).</description>

      <title>Executing a Successful Third Shot Drop in Pickleball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and investigate a successful third shot drop in pickleball using a numerical model of pickleball ball aerodynamics. Our overall objective is to investigate the ranges of initial speeds, angles and spins that result in a successful third shot drop. We conclude that the initial speed must be in the range $10.9~ms^{-1}$ to $13~ms^{-1}$ for down-the-line shots and $13.3~ ms^{-1}$ to $16~ms^{-1}$ for cross-court shots. The initial angle must be in the range $15.5$ degrees to $22.5$ degrees for down-the-line shots and $12.5$ degrees to $18$ degrees for cross-court shots. We conclude that the effects of spin on the third shot drop are of secondary importance. We believe these results could be useful as a guide to coaches and players wanting to develop this crucial aspect of the game of pickleball.</description>

      <title>Modified Axelrod Model Showing Opinion Convergence And Polarization In Realistic Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axelrod model is an opinion dynamics model such that each agent on a two-dimensional lattice has a finite number of possible opinions. The model is not realistic as all agents will eventually share the same opinion on every issue. Here we identify certain limitations inherent in the Axelrod model and address them by modifying some of the model's rules. Specifically, by considering agents in a scale-free network and incorporating a more realistic interaction rule with continuous values representing agents' opinions, our modified model offers a more comprehensive exploration of opinion dynamics. Computer simulation of our model shows a notable trend in opinion polarization on all features in the majority of reasonable simulation parameters. To mitigate this polarization, we introduce agents that work actively to reduce opinion differences. However, our findings indicate limited success in the approach. This research contributes to the understanding of opinion dynamics within society and highlights the nuanced complexities that arise when considering factors such as network structure and continuous opinion values. Our results prompt further exploration and open avenues for future investigations into effective methods of reducing opinion polarization.</description>

      <title>Threat-Agnostic Resilience: Framing and Application for Critical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure is not indestructible. Threats, both emergent and systemic, have propagated beyond historical norms that risk mitigation efforts alone cannot alleviate. Interdependencies between infrastructural systems compound consequences at vulnerable locations but can be harnessed to maximize operational efficiency and recovery capability. Characterizing practical forms of resilient infrastructure through 5 basic principles (modularity, distributedness, redundancy, diversity, and plasticity) provides a foundation for critical infrastructure systems to absorb, recover, and adapt to disruptions agnostic of threat source. Challenges exist in developing methodological foundations for these principles within practical applications to prevent sunk cost and over-constraining operational procedures. This study evaluates each principle, establishing practical forms, quantification strategies, and their impact on critical infrastructure resilience.</description>

      <title>Impact of inter-city interactions on disease scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-city interactions are critical for the transmission of infectious diseases, yet their effects on the scaling of disease cases remain largely underexplored. Here, we use the commuting network as a proxy for inter-city interactions, integrating it with a general scaling framework to describe the incidence of seven infectious diseases across Brazilian cities as a function of population size and the number of commuters. Our models significantly outperform traditional urban scaling approaches, revealing that the relationship between disease cases and a combination of population and commuters varies across diseases and is influenced by both factors. Although most cities exhibit a less-than-proportional increase in disease cases with changes in population and commuters, more-than-proportional responses are also observed across all diseases. Notably, in some small and isolated cities, proportional rises in population and commuters correlate with a reduction in disease cases. These findings suggest that such towns may experience improved health outcomes and socioeconomic conditions as they grow and become more connected. However, as growth and connectivity continue, these gains diminish, eventually giving way to challenges typical of larger urban areas - such as socioeconomic inequality and overcrowding - that facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. Our study underscores the interconnected roles of population size and commuter dynamics in disease incidence while highlighting that changes in population size exert a greater influence on disease cases than variations in the number of commuters.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Model of Incremental Multi-Agent Boltzmann Q-Learning: Transient Cooperation, Metastability, and Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning involves agents that learn together in a shared environment, leading to emergent dynamics sensitive to initial conditions and parameter variations. A Dynamical Systems approach, which studies the evolution of multi-component systems over time, has uncovered some of the underlying dynamics by constructing deterministic approximation models of stochastic algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that even in the simplest case of independent Q-learning with a Boltzmann exploration policy, significant discrepancies arise between the actual algorithm and previous approximations. We elaborate why these models actually approximate interesting variants rather than the original incremental algorithm. To explain the discrepancies, we introduce a new discrete-time approximation model that explicitly accounts for agents' update frequencies within the learning process and show that its dynamics fundamentally differ from the simplified dynamics of prior models. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to the question of spontaneous cooperation in social dilemmas, specifically the Prisoner's Dilemma as the simplest case study. We identify conditions under which the learning behaviour appears as long-term stable cooperation from an external perspective. However, our model shows that this behaviour is merely a metastable transient phase and not a true equilibrium, making it exploitable. We further exemplify how specific parameter settings can significantly exacerbate the moving target problem in independent learning. Through a systematic analysis of our model, we show that increasing the discount factor induces oscillations, preventing convergence to a joint policy. These oscillations arise from a supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, which transforms the unique stable fixed point into an unstable focus surrounded by a stable limit cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to a network-based framework where the degree distribution of nodes follows a Poisson distribution. This extension incorporates an additional parameter representing the mean node degree, allowing for the inclusion of heterogeneity in contact patterns. Using this enhanced model, we analyze epidemic data from the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, employing a survival approach combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our results suggest that network-based models can more effectively capture the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics compared to traditional compartmental models, without introducing unduly overcomplicated compartmental framework.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Pulse width modulation techniques of modular multilevel converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising converter technology for various highvoltage high-power applications. The reason to that is low-distortion output quantities can be achieved with low average switching frequencies per switch and without output filters. Modular multilevel converter pulse width modulation based control approaches are evaluated. The multicarrier PWM techniques such as Phase disposition PWM (PDPWM), Phase opposition disposition PWM (PODPWM), Alternate phase opposition disposition PWM (APODPWM) is employed and a comparative study is done based on the quality of the load voltage and load current output. This paper presents the simulation of single phase modular multilevel converter based on Half-Bridge sub module topology. Simulation has been carried out for various modulation techniques using MATLAB/Simulink and the results are observed.</description>

      <title>Evolution of mutating pathogens in networked populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic spreading over populations networks has been an important subject of research for several decades, and especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most epidemic outbreaks are likely to create multiple mutations during their spreading over the population. In this paper, we study the evolution of a pathogen which can mutate continuously during the epidemic spreading. We consider pathogens whose mutating parameter is the mortality mean-time, and study the evolution of this parameter over the spreading process. We use analytical methods to compute the dynamic equation of the epidemic and the conditions for it to spread. We also use numerical simulations to study the pathogen flow in this case, and to understand the mutation phenomena. We show that the natural selection leads to less violent pathogens becoming predominant in the population. We discuss a wide range of network structures and show how different effects are manifested in each case.</description>

      <title>Random matching in balanced bipartite graphs: The (un)fairness of draw mechanisms used in sports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09274v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The draw of some knockout tournaments requires finding a perfect matching in a balanced bipartite graph. The problem becomes challenging with draw constraints: the two field-proven procedures used in sports are known to be non-uniformly distributed (the feasible matchings are not equally likely), which may threaten fairness. We compare the biases of both mechanisms, each of them having two forms, for reasonable subsets of balanced bipartite graphs up to 16 nodes. A mechanism is found to dominate all others in the draw of quarterfinals under reasonable restrictions. The UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draw is verified to apply the best design among the four available options between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons. However, considerable scope remains to improve the performance of these randomisation procedures, especially because they tend to distort the probabilities in the same direction and roughly with the same magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shell structure holds significant importance in various domains such as information dissemination, supply chain management, and transportation. This study focuses on investigating the shell structure of hub and non-hub nodes, which play important roles in these domains. Our framework explores the topology of Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks, considering source node selection strategies dependent on the nodes' degrees. We define the shell $l$ in a network as the set of nodes at a distance $l$ from a given node and represent $r_l$ as the fraction of nodes outside shell $l$. Statistical properties of the shells are examined for a selected node, taking into account the node's degree. For a network with a given degree distribution, we analytically derive the degree distribution and average degree of nodes outside shell $l$ as functions of $r_l$. Moreover, we discover that $r_l$ follows an iterative functional form $r_l = \phi(r_{l-1})$, where $\phi$ is expressed in terms of the generating function of the original degree distribution of the network.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary game theory approach to modeling behavioral interaction in disclosing infection begins with an outbreak: COVID-19 as an example</title>

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of people worldwide prompted the implementation of a range of preventive measures at local, national, and international levels. Early in the outbreak, before the vaccine became accessible, voluntary quarantine and social isolation emerged as crucial strategies to curb the spread of infection. In this research, we present a game-theoretic model to elucidate the voluntary disclosure of exposure to infected individuals within communities. By employing a fractional derivative approach to illustrate disease propagation within the compartmental model, we determine the minimum level of voluntary disclosure required to disrupt the chain of transmission and allow the epidemic to fade. Our findings suggest that higher transmission rates and increased perceived severity of infection change the externality of disclosing infected exposure, thereby contributing to a rise in the proportion of individuals opting for quarantine and reducing disease incidence. We estimate behavioral parameters and transmission rates by fitting the model to hospitalized cases in Chile, South America. Results from our paper underscore the potential for public health authorities to influence and regulate voluntary disclosure of infection during emerging outbreaks through effective risk communication, emphasizing the severity of the disease, and providing accurate information about hospital capacity to the public.</description>

      <title>Empirical Networks are Sparse: Enhancing Multi-Edge Models with Zero-Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks are sparse. As we show in this article, even when a large number of interactions is observed, most node pairs remain disconnected. We demonstrate that classical multi-edge network models, such as the $G(N,p)$, configuration models, and stochastic block models, fail to accurately capture this phenomenon. To mitigate this issue, zero-inflation must be integrated into these traditional models. Through zero-inflation, we incorporate a mechanism that accounts for the excess number of zeroes (disconnected pairs) observed in empirical data. By performing an analysis on all the datasets from the Sociopatterns repository, we illustrate how zero-inflated models more accurately reflect the sparsity and heavy-tailed edge count distributions observed in empirical data. Our findings underscore that failing to account for these ubiquitous properties in real-world networks inadvertently leads to biased models that do not accurately represent complex systems and their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>
