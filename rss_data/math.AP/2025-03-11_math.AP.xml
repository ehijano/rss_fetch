      <title>Low Mach number limit for the diffusion approximation model in radiation hydrodynamics at equilibrium-diffusion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low Mach number limit for the compressible viscous diffusion approximation model arising in radiation hydrodynamics is rigorously justified. For the 3-D Cauchy problem, the solutions in an equilibrium diffusion regime are shown to converge to the solutions of an incompressible Navier-Stokes equations locally and globally in time as Mach number goes to zero, when the effect of the small temperature variation upon the limit is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Fourier mass lower bounds for Batchelor-regime passive scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batchelor predicted that a passive scalar $\psi^\nu$ with diffusivity $\nu$, advected by a smooth fluid velocity, should typically have Fourier mass distributed as $|\hat \psi^\nu|^2(k) \approx |k|^{-d}$ for $|k| \ll \nu^{-1/2}$. For a broad class of velocity fields, we give a quantitative lower bound for a version of this prediction summed over constant width annuli in Fourier space. This improves on previously known results, which require the prediction to be summed over the whole ball.</description>

      <title>Singular nonlocal elliptic systems via nonlinear Rayleigh quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we establish the existence of two positive solutions for singular nonlocal elliptic systems. More precisely, we consider the following nonlocal elliptic problem: $$\left\{\begin{array}{lll} (-\Delta)^su +V_1(x)u = \lambda\frac{a(x)}{u^p} + \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\theta |u|^{\alpha - 2}u|v|^{\beta}, \,\,\, \mbox{in} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^N,\\ (-\Delta)^sv +V_2(x)v= \lambda \frac{b(x)}{v^q}+ \frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}\theta |u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta-2}v, \,\,\, \mbox{in} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^N, \end{array}\right. \;\;\;(u, v) \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N) \times H^s(\mathbb{R}^N),$$ where $ 0&lt;p \leq q &lt; 1&lt;\;\alpha, \beta \;,\;2&lt;\alpha + \beta &lt; 2^*_s$, $\theta &gt; 0, \lambda &gt; 0, N &gt; 2s$, and $s \in (0,1)$. The potentials $V_1, V_2: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions which are bounded from below. Under our assumptions, we prove that there exists the largest positive number $\lambda^* &gt; 0$ such that our main problem admits at least two positive solutions for each $\lambda \in (0, \lambda^*)$. Here we apply the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient together with the Nehari method. The main feature is to minimize the energy functional in Nehari set which allows us to prove our results without any restriction on the size of parameter $\theta &gt; 0$. Moreover, we shall consider the multiplicity of solutions for the case $\lambda = \lambda^*$ where degenerated points are allowed.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions for singular elliptic problems with Stein-Weiss term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we establish the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for the singular elliptic equations with a double weighted nonlocal interaction term defined in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$. The nonlocal term and the fact that the energy functional is not differentiable are the main difficulties for this kind of problem. We apply the Nehari method and the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient to prove that our main problem has at least two positive weak solutions. Furthermore, we prove a nonexistence result related to the extreme $\lambda^*&gt; 0$ given by the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for the fractional $p$-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider local weak solutions to the fractional $p$-Poisson equation of order $s$, i.e. $\left( - \Delta_p\right)^s u = f$. In the range $p&gt;1$ and $s\in \big(\frac{p-1}{p},1\big)$ we prove Calder\'on &amp; Zygmund type estimates at the gradient level. More precisely, we show for any $q&gt;1$ that \begin{equation*}
  f\in L^{\frac{qp}{p-1}}_{\rm loc}
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  \nabla u\in L^{qp}_{\rm loc}. \end{equation*} The qualitative result is accompanied by a local quantitative estimate.</description>

      <title>Fractional De Giorgi conjecture in dimension 2 via complex-plane methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the fractional version of the De Giorgi conjecture for the Allen-Cahn equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ for the full range of exponents. Our proof combines a method introduced by A. Farina in 2003 with the $s$-harmonic extension of the fractional Laplacian in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{3}_+$ introduced by L. Caffarelli and L. Silvestre in 2007. We also provide a representation formula for finite-energy weak solutions of a class of weighted elliptic partial differential equations in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+$ under Neumann boundary conditions. This generalizes the $s$-harmonic extension of the fractional Laplacian and allows us to relate a general problem in the extended space with a nonlocal problem on the trace.</description>

      <title>Limit of quasilinear equations and related extremal problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a complete analysis of the limiting behaviour of a class of quasilinear problems with Dirichlet boundary data g. We show that the Lipschitz constant of g plays a role in controlling the Gamma-convergence of the natural energies. However the solutions converge uniformly to solution of a limiting equation irrelevant to the Lipschitz constant of g. The limiting equation has no coercivity in u. We prove that the limiting equation admits a weak comparison principle and has a unique viscosity solution. We also obtain a Poincare inequality in the Sobolev-Orlicz space for discontinuous operator, which paves the way for our study of an extremal problem where its operator becomes unbounded in a subdomain. Upon giving proper meaning to its solution, we show that the extremal problem has a unique solution. It turns out the solution has sufficient continuity, although operator is discontinuous. In the appendix we provide some technical inequalities which play crucial roles in the proof of uniqueness and we believe will be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of contact points in 2D Boussinesq flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of contact lines for thermal convection of viscous fluids in a 2D open-top vessel. The domain is bounded above by a free moving boundary and otherwise by the solid wall of a vessel. The dynamics of the fluid are governed by the incompressible Boussinesq approximation under the influence of gravity, and the interface between fluid and air is under the effect of capillary forces. Motivated by energy-dissipation structure in [Guo-Tice, J. Eur. Math. Soc, 2024], we develop global well posedness theory in the framework of nonlinear energy methods for the initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium. Moreover, the solutions decay to equilibrium at an exponential rate. Our methods are mainly based on the construction of solutions to convected heat equation and a priori estimates of a geometric formulation of the Boussinesq equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical geometric problem of prescribing the scalar and the boundary mean curvature in the unit ball endowed with the standard Euclidean metric. We will deal with the case of negative scalar curvature showing the existence of infinitely many non-radial positive solutions when the dimension is larger or equal to 5. This is the first result of existence of solutions in the case of negative prescribed scalar curvature problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The initial-to-final-state inverse problem with time-independent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial-to-final-state inverse problem consists in determining a quantum Hamiltonian assuming the knowledge of the state of the system at some fixed time, for every initial state. This problem was formulated by Caro and Ruiz and motivated by the data-driven prediction problem in quantum mechanics. Caro and Ruiz analysed the question of uniqueness for Hamiltonians of the form $-\Delta + V$ with an electric potential $V = V(\mathrm{t}, \mathrm{x})$ that depends on the time and space variables. In this context, they proved that uniqueness holds in dimension $n \geq 2$ whenever the potentials are bounded and have super-exponential decay at infinity. Although their result does not seem to be optimal, one would expect at least some degree of exponential decay to be necessary for the potentials. However, in this paper, we show that by restricting the analysis to Hamiltonians with time-independent electric potentials, namely $V = V(\mathrm{x})$, uniqueness can be established for bounded integrable potentials exhibiting only super-linear decay at infinity, in any dimension $n \geq 2$. This surprising improvement is possible because, unlike Caro and Ruiz's approach, our argument avoids the use of complex geometrical optics (CGO). Instead, we rely on the construction of stationary states at different energies -- this is possible because the potential does not depend on time. These states will have an explicit leading term, given by a Herglotz wave, plus a correction term that will vanish as the energy grows. Besides the significant relaxation of decay assumptions on the potential, the avoidance of CGO solutions is important in its own right, since such solutions are not readily available in more complicated geometric settings.</description>

      <title>An inviscid limit problem for Navier-Stokes equations in 3D domains with oscillatory boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inviscid limit problem for a class of Navier-Stokes equations with vanishing measurable viscous coefficients in 3-dimensional spatial domains whose boundaries are oscillatory, depending on a small parameter, and become flat when the parameter converges to zero. Under some sufficient conditions on the anisotropic vanishing rates of the eigenvalues of the matrices of the viscous coefficients and the oscillatory parameter, we show that Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with no slip boundary condition converge to solutions of the Euler equations in the upper half space. To prove the result, we apply a change of variables to flatten the boundaries of the spatial domains for the Navier-Stokes equations, and then construct the boundary layer terms. As the Navier-Stokes equations and the Euler equations are originally written in two different domains, additional boundary layer terms are constructed and their estimates are obtained.</description>

      <title>Identifying point sources for biharmonic wave equation from the scattered fields at sparse sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to uniqueness and numerical algorithms for determining the point sources of the biharmonic wave equation using scattered fields at sparse sensors. We first show that the point sources in both $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be uniquely determined from the multifrequency sparse scattered fields. In particular, to deal with the challenges arising from the fundamental solution of the biharmonic wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we present an innovative approach that leverages the Fourier transform and Funk-Hecke formula. Such a technique can also be applied for identifying the point sources of the Helmholtz equation. Moreover, we present the uniqueness results for identifying multiple point sources in $\mathbb{R}^3$ from the scattered fields at sparse sensors with finitely many frequencies. Based on the constructive uniqueness proofs, we propose three numerical algorithms for identifying the point sources by using multifrequency sparse scattered fields. The numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the strong positive solution for a general quasilinear elliptic problem with variable exponents and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions using a generalization of the $p(x)$-D\'{i}az-Saa inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalization of the D\'iaz-Saa inequality and its applications to nonlinear elliptic problems. We first present the necessary hypotheses and preliminary results before introducing an improved version of the inequality, which holds in a broader functional setting and allows applications to problems with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The significance of cases where the inequality becomes an equality is also analyzed, leading to uniqueness results for certain classes of partial differential equations. Furthermore, we provide a detailed proof of a uniqueness theorem for strong positive solutions and illustrate our findings with two concrete applications: a multiple-phase problem and an elliptic quasilinear equation relevant to image processing. The paper concludes with possible directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Remainder terms, profile decomposition and sharp quantitative stability in the fractional nonlocal Sobolev-type inequality with $n&gt;2s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following fractional nonlocal Sobolev-type inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  C_{HLS}\bigg(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\big(|x|^{-\mu} \ast |u|^{p_s}\big)|u|^{p_s} dx\bigg)^{\frac{1}{p_s}}\leq\|u\|_{\dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^n)}^2\quad \mbox{for all}~~u\in \dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation*}
  induced by the classical fractional Sobolev inequality and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for $s\in(0,\frac{n}{2})$, $\mu\in(0,n)$ and where $p_{s}=\frac{2n-\mu}{n-2s}\geq2$ is energy-critical exponent. The $C_{HLS}&gt;0$ is a constant depending on the dimension $n$, parameters $s$ and $\mu$, which can be achieved by $W(x)$, and up to translation and scaling, $W(x)$ is the unique positive and radially symmetric extremal function of the nonlocal Sobolev-type inequality. It is well-known that, up to a suitable scaling,
  \begin{equation*}
  (-\Delta)^{s}u=(|x|^{-\mu}\ast |u|^{p_s})|u|^{p_s-2}u\quad \mbox{for all}~~u\in\dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation*}
  is the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the associated minimization problem.
  In this paper, we first prove the non-degeneracy of positive solutions to the critical Hartree equation for all $s\in(0,\frac{n}{2})$, $\mu\in(0,n)$ with $0&lt;\mu\leq4s$. Furthermore, we show the existence of a gradient type remainder term and, as a corollary, derive the existence of a remainder term in the weak $L^{\frac{n}{n-2s}}$-norm for functions supported in domains of finite measure, under the condition $s\in(0,\frac{n}{2})$. Finally, we establish a Struwe-type profile decomposition and quantitative stability estimates for critical points of the above inequality in the parameter region $s\in(0,\frac{n}{2})$ with the number of bubbles $\kappa\geq1$, and for $\mu\in(0,n)$ with $0&lt;\mu\leq4s$. In particular, we provide an example to illustrate the sharpness of our result for $n=6s$ and $\mu=4s$.</description>

      <title>Perfectly matched layers in time domain. A simple two-dimensional error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) has become a very common method for the numerical approximation of wave and wave-like equations on unbounded domains. This technique allows one to obtain accurate solutions while working on a finite computational domain, and the technique is relatively simple to implement. Results concerning the accuracy of the PML method have been obtained, but mostly with regard problems at a fixed frequency. In this paper we provide very explicit time-domain bounds on the accuracy of PML for the two-dimensional wave equation and illustrate our conclusions with some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability in Fractional Hardy-Sobolev Inequalities: The Role of Euler-Lagrange Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates sharp stability estimates for the fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality: $$\mu_{s,t}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right) \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u|^{2^*_s(t)}}{|x|^t} \,{\rm d}x \right)^{\frac{2}{2^*_s(t)}} \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \left|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}} u \right|^2 \,{\rm d}x, \quad \text{for all } u \in \dot{H}^s\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right),$$ where $N &gt; 2s$, $s \in (0,1)$, $0 &lt; t &lt; 2s &lt; N $, and $2^*_s(t) = \frac{2(N-t)}{N-2s}$. Here, $\mu_{s,t}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$ represents the best constant in the inequality.
  The paper focuses on the quantitative stability results of the above inequality and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation near a positive ground-state solution. Additionally, a qualitative stability result is established for the Euler-Lagrange equation, offering a thorough characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences for the associated energy functional. These results generalize the sharp quantitative stability results for the classical Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$, originally obtained by Bianchi and Egnell \cite{BE91} as well as the corresponding critical exponent problem in $\mathbb{R}^N$, explored by Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi \cite{CFM18} in the framework of fractional calculus.</description>

      <title>Variational analysis of discrete Dirichlet problems in periodically perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of a family of discrete functionals as the lattice size, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, tends to zero. We consider pairwise interaction energies satisfying $p$-growth conditions, $p&lt;d$, $d$ being the dimension of the reference configuration, defined on discrete functions subject to Dirichlet conditions on a $\delta$-periodic array of small squares of side $r_{\delta}\sim \delta^{d/d-p}$. Our analysis is performed in the framework of $\Gamma$-convergence and we prove that, in the regime $\varepsilon=o(r_{\delta})$, the discrete energy and their continuum counterpart share the same $\Gamma$-limit and the effect of the constraints leads to a capacitary term in the limit energy as in the classical theory of periodically perforated domains for local integral functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is devoted to the global well-posedness in W^{1, (4, 2)}(R\times R^{+}) of the integro-differential problem involving the square of the one dimensional Laplace operator along with the drift term. Our proof is based on a fixed point technique. Moreover, we provide the assumption leading to the existence of the nontrivial solution for the problem under the consideration. Such equation is relevant to the cell population dynamics in the Mathematical Biology.</description>

      <title>On the system of $2$-D elastic waves with critical space dependent damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06854v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, H.\,Brezis published a list of his ``favorite open problems", which he described as challenges he had ``raised throughout his career and has resisted so far". We provide a complete resolution to the first one--Open Problem 1.1--in Brezis's favorite open problems list: the existence of solutions to the long-standing Brezis-Nirenberg problem on a three-dimensional ball. Furthermore, using the building blocks of Del Pino-Musso-Pacard-Pistoia sign-changing solutions to the Yamabe problem, we establish the existence of infinitely many sign-changing, nonradial solutions for the full range of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Generic non-degeneracy of critical points of multiple Green functions on torus and applications to curvature equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E_{\tau}:=\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau)$ with $\operatorname{Im}\tau&gt;0$ be a flat torus and $G(z;\tau)$ be the Green function on $E_{\tau}$ with the singularity at $0$. Consider the multiple Green function $G_{n}$ on $(E_{\tau})^{n}$: \[ G_{n}(z_{1},\cdots,z_{n};\tau):=\sum_{i&lt;j}G(z_{i}-z_{j};\tau)-n\sum_{i=1}% ^{n}G(z_{i};\tau). \] Recently, Lin (J. Differ. Geom. to appear) proved that there are at least countably many analytic curves in $\mathbb H=\{\tau : \operatorname{Im}\tau&gt;0\}$ such that $G_n(\cdot;\tau)$ has degenerate critical points for any $\tau$ on the union of these curves. In this paper, we prove that there is a measure zero subset $\mathcal{O}_n\subset \mathbb H$ (containing these curves) such that for any $\tau\in \mathbb H\setminus\mathcal{O}_n$, all critical points of $G_n(\cdot;\tau)$ are non-degenerate.
  Applications to counting the exact number of solutions of the curvature equation $\Delta u+e^{u}=\rho \delta_{0}$ on $E_{\tau}$
  will be given.</description>

      <title>Stability Estimates in Kinetic Wasserstein Distances for the Vlasov-Poisson System with Yudovich Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system using the unifying framework of the kinetic Wasserstein distance, introduced by Iacobelli in (Section 4 in Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 244 (2022), no. 1, 27-50). This allows us to treat both macroscopic densities that lie in a Yudovich space, as recently considered by Crippa et al. (Theorem 1.6 in Nonlinearity 37 (2024), no. 9, 095015) for the $1$-Wasserstein distance, and higher order Wasserstein distances, for which only bounded macroscopic densities were treated by Iacobelli and the first author (Theorem 1.11 in Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 56 (2024), 2250-2267). First, we establish an $L^p$-estimate on the difference between two force fields in terms of a suitable nonlinear quantity that controls the kinetic Wasserstein distance between their macroscopic densities. Second, we use this estimate in order to derive a closable Osgood-type inequality for the kinetic Wasserstein distance between two solutions. This enables us to prove our main theorem; for $1 \le p &lt; +\infty$ we show the $p$-Wasserstein stability of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system with macroscopic densities belonging to a Yudovich space.</description>

      <title>Stability of propagating terraces in spatially periodic multistable equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large time behaviour of solutions of multistable reaction-diffusion equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$, with a spatially periodic heterogeneity. By multistable, we mean that the problem admits a finite -- but arbitrarily large -- number of stable, periodic steady states. In contrast with the more classical monostable and bistable frameworks, which exhibit the emergence of a single travelling front in the long run, in the present case the large time dynamics is governed by a family of stacked travelling fronts, involving intermediate steady states, called propagating terrace. Their existence in the multidimensional case has been established in our previous work [13]. The first result of the present paper is their uniqueness. Next, we show that the speeds of the propagating terraces in different directions dictate the spreading speeds of solutions of the Cauchy problem, for both planar-like and compactly supported initial data. The latter case turns out to be much more intricate than the former, due to the fact that the propagating terraces in distinct directions may involve different sets of intermediate steady states. Another source of difficulty is that the Wulff shape of the speeds of travelling fronts can be non-smooth, as we show in the bistable case using a result of [4].</description>

      <title>On a class of triangular cross-diffusion systems and its fast reaction approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the emergence of cross-diffusion terms in the time evolution of two slow-fast species in competition for resources. A class of triangular cross-diffusion systems is obtained as the singular limit of a fast reaction-diffusion system, as the time scale $\epsilon$ of the fast reaction goes to 0. We prove that the classical solution of the fast reaction-diffusion system converges towards a weak solution of the cross-diffusion system and we show a convergence rate for bounded solutions. The main tool used is a family of energy functionals, giving suitable a priori estimates, uniformly on $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Local H\"older regularity for bounded, signed solutions to nonlocal Trudinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local H\"older regularity for bounded and sign-changing weak solutions to nonlocal Trudinger equations of the form \[ (|u|^{p-2}u)_t + \text{P.V.} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{|u(x,t) - u(y,t)|^{p-2}(u(x,t)-u(y,t))}{|x-y|^{n+sp}} = 0, \]
  in the range $1&lt; p&lt;\infty$ and $s \in (0,1)$. One of the main difficulties in extending the local theory to the nonlocal Trudinger equation is that when $0 \ll u \ll \infty$ locally, a crucial change of variable is unavailable in the nonlocal case due to the presence of the Tail term. We adapt several new ideas developed in the past few years to prove the required H\"older regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the study of the fluence rate over both healthy and tumor tissues in the presence of focal laser ablation (FLA). We propose new analytical solutions for the coupled partial differential equations (PDE) system, which includes the transport equation modeling the light penetration into biological tissue, the bioheat equation modeling the heat transfer and its respective damage. The present building could be the first step to the knowledge of the mathematical framework for biothermophysical problems, as well as the main key to simplify the numerical calculation due to its no cost. We derive exact solutions and simulate results from them. We discuss the potential physical contributions and present respective conclusions about (1) the validness of the diffusion approximation of the radiative transfer equation; (2) the local behavior of the source of scattered photons; (3) the unsteady-state of the fluence rate; and (4) the boundedness of the critical time of the thermal damage to the cancerous tissue. We also discuss some controversial and diverging hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the famous Talenti's symmetrization inequality, more precisely its $L^p$ corollary asserting that the $L^p$-norm of the solution to $-\Delta v=f^\sharp$ is higher than the $L^p$-norm of the solution to $-\Delta u=f$ (we are considering Dirichlet boundary conditions, and $f^\sharp$ denotes the Schwarz symmetrization of $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}_+$). We focus on the particular case where functions $f$ are defined on the unit ball, and are characteristic functions of a subset of this unit ball. We show in this case that stability occurs for the $L^p$-Talenti inequality with the sharp exponent 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation linearized around the Ginzburg-Landau vortex of degree one under equivariant symmetry. Among the main results of this work, we determine the spectrum of the linearized operator, uncover a remarkable $L^2$-norm growth phenomenon related to a zero-energy resonance, and provide a complete construction of the distorted Fourier transform at small energies. The latter hinges upon a meticulous analysis of the behavior of the resolvent in the upper and lower half-planes in a small disk around zero-energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the energy decay of a viscoelastic variable coefficient wave equation with nonlocality in time as well as nonlinear damping and polynomial nonlinear terms. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish a polynomial energy decay for the solution under relatively weak assumptions regarding the kernel of the nonlocal term. More specifically, we improve the decay rate of the energy by additionally imposing a certain convexity assumption on the kernel. Several examples are provided to confirm such improvements to faster polynomial or even exponential decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big),\nonumber
  u_j\in H_{per}^1(\Omega)\mbox{ for }i\in I=\{1,\cdots,n\}\nonumber,
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation} where $h_j\in C^3(\Omega)$, $h_j&gt;0$, $\rho_j&gt;0$ and $u=(u_1,..,u_n)$ is doubly periodic on $\partial\Omega$. The matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem about Liouville systems is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi-bubble solutions in the most general setting.</description>

Specifically, we investigate the approximation (in the sense of {\Gamma}-convergence) of the energy by means of functionals defined on perforated domains. Perforations are introduced at flaw points where singularities are expected and, hence, the corresponding deformations do not exhibit cavitation. Notably, those points are not prescribed but rather selected by the variational principle. Our analysis is motivated by the numerical simulation of cavitation and extends previous results on models which solely accounted for elastic energy but neglected contributions related to the formation of cavities.</description>

      <title>Degenerate parabolic equations in divergence form: fundamental solution and Gaussian bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider second order degenerate parabolic equations with complex, measurable, and time-dependent coefficients. The degenerate ellipticity is dictated by a spatial $A_2$-weight. We prove that having a generalized fundamental solution with upper Gaussian bounds is equivalent to Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions. In the special case of real coefficients, Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates are known, which provide an easier proof of Gaussian upper bounds, and a known Harnack inequality is then used to derive Gaussian lower bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of flat flow solutions to the periodic and planar two-phase Mullins-Sekerka flow and area-preserving curvature flow. We show that flat flows converge to either a finite union of equally sized disjoint disks or to a finite union of disjoint strips or to the complement of these configurations exponentially fast. A key ingredient in our approach is the derivation of a sharp quantitative Alexandrov inequality for periodic smooth sets.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of a solution to the Ricci flow with a compact length space of bounded curvature, i.e., a space that has curvature bounded above and below in the sense of Alexandrov, as its initial condition. We show that this flow converges in the $C^{1,\alpha}$-sense to a $C^{1,\alpha}$-continuous Riemannian manifold which is isometric to the original metric space. Moreover, we prove that the flow is uniquely determined by the initial condition, up to isometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of compactness of Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces. We avoid any unnecessary restrictions and cover also embeddings of higher order, providing a complete picture within this framework. To achieve this, we need to develop new techniques because the usual techniques used in the study of compactness of Sobolev embeddings in the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces are limited to domains of finite measure, which is essential for them to work. Furthermore, we also study certain weighted Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on balls. We completely characterize their compactness and also describe optimal target rearrangement-invariant function spaces in these weighted Sobolev embeddings.</description>

      <title>Invasion dynamics of super invaders: Elimination of Allee effects by a strategy at the range boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a reaction-diffusion model with free boundaries in one space dimension for a single population species with density $u(t,x)$ and population range $[g(t), h(t)]$, we demonstrate that the Allee effects can be eliminated if the species maintains its population density at a suitable level at the range boundary by advancing or retreating the fronts. It is proved that with such a strategy at the range edge the species can invade the environment successfully with all admissible initial populations, exhibiting the dynamics of super invaders. Numerical simulations are used to help understand what happens if the population density level at the range boundary is maintained at other levels. If the invading cane toads in Australia used this strategy at the range boundary to become a super invader, then our results may explain why toads near the invading front evolve to have longer legs and run faster.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Uniqueness of the Integral Invariant in A Characteristic-type Semi-Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A characteristic Galerkin-type semi-Lagrangian discontinuous finite element scheme (CSLDG) is investigated, which directly discretizes an integral invariant model derived from the coupling of a transport equation and its dual equation. Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this method, no studies have yet explored the well-posedness of the integral invariant model itself. To address this gap, a weak solution theory for CSLDG is developed: A precise definition of the weak solution for the integral invariant model is formulated. Utilizing the slice method, which is frequently employed in existence proofs for parabolic equations, the existence of the weak solution is established through the application of the Riesz Representation Theorem and mollifier techniques. The stability of the integral invariant weak solution is subsequently demonstrated by the strategic selection of the test function Psi, leading to the proof of its uniqueness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a 3-wave kinetic equation, derived from the elastic beam wave equation on the lattice. The ergodicity condition states that two distinct wavevectors are supposed to be connected by a finite number of collisions. In this work, we prove that the ergodicity condition is violated and the equation domain is broken into disconnected domains, called no-collision and collisional invariant regions. If one starts with a general initial condition, whose energy is finite, then in the long-time limit, the solutions of the 3-wave kinetic equation remain unchanged on the no-collision region and relax to local equilibria on the disjoint collisional invariant regions.</description>

      <title>Localized and degenerate controls for the incompressible Navier-Stokes system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the global approximate controllability of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes system driven by a physically localized and degenerate force. In other words, the fluid is regulated via four scalar controls that depend only on time and appear as coefficients in an effectively constructed driving force supported in a given subdomain. Our idea consists of squeezing low mode controls into a small region, essentially by tracking their actions along the characteristic curves of a linearized vorticity equation. In this way, through explicit constructions and by connecting Coron's return method with recent concepts from geometric control, the original problem for the nonlinear Navier-Stokes system is reduced to one for a linear transport equation steered by a global force. This article can be viewed as an attempt to tackle a well-known open problem due to Agrachev.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Catenoid for the Hyperbolic Vanishing Mean Curvature Equation Outside Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of stability of the catenoid, which is an asymptotically flat rotationally symmetric minimal surface in Euclidean space, viewed as a stationary solution to the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature equation in Minkowski space. The latter is a quasilinear wave equation that constitutes the hyperbolic counterpart of the minimal surface equation in Euclidean space. Our main result is the nonlinear asymptotic stability, modulo suitable translation and boost (i.e., modulation), of the $n$-dimensional catenoid with respect to a codimension one set of initial data perturbations without any symmetry assumptions, for $n \geq 5$. The modulation and the codimension one restriction on the data are necessary and optimal in view of the kernel and the unique simple eigenvalue, respectively, of the stability operator of the catenoid.
  In a broader context, this paper fits in the long tradition of studies of soliton stability problems. From this viewpoint, our aim here is to tackle some new issues that arise due to the quasilinear nature of the underlying hyperbolic equation. Ideas introduced in this paper include a new profile construction and modulation analysis to track the evolution of the translation and boost parameters of the stationary solution, a new scheme for proving integrated local energy decay for the perturbation in the quasilinear and modulation-theoretic context, and an adaptation of the vectorfield method in the presence of dynamic translations and boosts of the stationary solution.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects on the Controllability of Coupled KdV Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exact boundary controllability of a nonlinear coupled system of two Korteweg-de Vries equations on a bounded interval. The model describes the interactions of two weakly nonlinear gravity waves in a stratified fluid. Due to the nature of the system, six boundary conditions are required. However, to study the controllability property, we consider a different combination of the control inputs, with a maximum of four. Firstly, the results are obtained for the linearized system through a classical duality approach and some hidden regularity properties of the boundary terms. This approach reduces the controllability problem to the study of a spectral problem, which is solved by using the Paley-Wiener method introduced by Rosier. Then, the issue is to establish when a certain quotient of entire functions still turns out to be an entire function. It can be viewed as a problem of factoring an entire function that, depending on the control configuration, leads to the study of a transcendental equation. Finally, by using the contraction mapping theorem, we derive the local controllability for the full system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01319v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of double phase systems which contain the singular and mixed nonlinear terms. Unlike the single equation, the mixed nonlinear terms make the problem more complicate. The geometry of the fibering mapping has multiple possibilities. To overcome the difficulties posed by the mixed nonlinear terms, we need to repeatedly construct concave functions, discuss different cases, and use the properties of concave functions and basic inequalities such as H\"{o}lder inequality, Poincar\'{e}'s inequality and Young's inequality. By the use of the Nehari manifold, the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions which have nonnegative energy are obtained.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a (not necessarily strictly) convex, $C^1$ domain, and $\mu$ and $\bar{\mu}$ are probability measures absolutely continuous with respect to surface measure on $\partial \Omega$, with densities bounded away from zero and infinity, whose $2$-Monge-Kantorovich distance is sufficiently small, then there exists a continuous Monge solution to the optimal transport problem with cost function given by the quadratic distance on the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This result is also shown to be sharp, via a counterexample when $\Omega$ is uniformly convex but not $C^1$. Additionally, if $\Omega$ is $C^{1, \alpha}$ regular for some $\alpha$, then the Monge solution is shown to be H\"older continuous.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Hydrodynamic Stability for Couette Flow on Unbounded Domains with Navier Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a stability threshold theorem for 2D Navier-Stokes on three unbounded domains: the whole plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, the half plane $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\infty)$ with Navier boundary conditions, and the infinite channel $\mathbb{R} \times [-1, 1]$ with Navier boundary conditions. Starting with the Couette shear flow, we consider initial perturbations $\omega_{in}$ which are of size $\nu^{1/2}(1+\ln(1/\nu)^{1/2})^{-1}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space with an additional low frequency control condition for the planar cases. We then demonstrate that such perturbations exhibit inviscid damping of the velocity, as well as enhanced dissipation at $x$-frequencies $|k| \gg \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu^{-1/3}|k|^{-2/3})$. On the plane and half-plane, we show Taylor dispersion for $x$-frequencies $|k| \ll \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu |k|^{-2})$, while on the channel we show low frequency dispersion for $|k| \ll \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu^{-1})$. Generalizing the work of arXiv:2311.00141 done on $\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$, the key contribution of this paper is to perform new nonlinear computations at low frequencies with wave number $|k| \lesssim \nu$ and at intermediate frequencies with wave number $\nu \lesssim |k| \leq 1$, and to provide the first enhanced dissipation result for a fully-nonlinear shear flow on an unbounded $x$-domain. Additionally, we demonstrate that the results of this paper apply equally to solutions of the perturbed $\beta$-plane equations from atmospheric dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for any Leray solution $u$ to the $3$D Navier--Stokes equations with $u_0\in L^2$, the associated deterministic and stochastic Lagrangian trajectories are unique for Lebesgue a.e. initial condition. Additionally, if $u_0\in H^{1/2}$, then pathwise uniqueness is established for the stochastic Lagrangian trajectories starting from every initial condition. The result sharpens and extends the original one by Robinson and Sadowski (Nonlinearity 2009) and is based on rather different techniques. A key role is played by a newly established asymmetric Lusin--Lipschitz property of Leray solutions $u$, in the framework of (random) Regular Lagrangian flows.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Hartree-Fock equation in 1D, for a small and localised initial data and a finite measure potential. We show that there is no long range scattering due to a nonlinear cancellation between the direct term and the exchange term for plane waves. We employ the framework of space-time resonances that enables us to single out precisely this cancellation and to obtain scattering to linear waves as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic descriptions of the Euler alignment system with adaptive communication strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous joint work on the $\st$-model in[\textit{Well-posedness and long time behavior of the Euler Alignment System with adaptive communication strength}, accepted at the Abel Symposium Proceedings, also arXiv:2310.00269, 2023]. The $\st$-model, introduced by the first author in [\textit{Environmental averaging}. EMS Surv. Math. Sci., 11 (2024), no. 2, 277413],is an alignment model with the property that the strength of the alignment force, $\st$, is transported along an averaged velocity field. The transport of the strength is designed so that it admits an $e$-quantity, $e = \partial_x u + \st$, which controls regularity in 1D similarly to the classical Cucker-Smale case. The utility of the $\st$-model is that it has the versatility to behave qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model, for which global regularity theory is not known.
  This paper aims to put the $\st$-model on firmer physical grounds by formulating and justifying the microscopic and mesoscopic descriptions from which it arises. A distinctive feature of the microscopic system is that it is a discrete-continuous system: the position and velocity of the particles are discrete objects, while the strength is an active continuum scalar function. We establish a rigorous passage from the microscopic to the mesoscopic description via the Mean Field Limit and from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic description in the monokinetic and Maxwellian limiting regimes. We also address the long-time behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation by establishing the relaxation to the Maxwellian in 1D when the velocity averaging is given by the Favre filtration. As a supplement to the numerical results already presented in our previous work, we provide additional numerical evidence, via a particle simulation, that the $\st$-model behaves qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model.</description>

      <title>On the justification of Koiter's model for generalised membrane shells of the fist kind confined in a half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we justify Koiter's model for linearly elastic generalised membrane shells of the first kind subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space. After showing that the confinement condition considered in this paper is in general stronger, under the validity of the Kirchhoff-Love assumptions, than the classical Signorini condition, we formulate the corresponding obstacle problem for a three-dimensional linearly elastic generalised membrane shell of the first kind, and we conduct a rigorous asymptotic analysis as the thickness approaches to zero on the unique solution for one such model. We show that the solution to the three-dimensional obstacle problem converges to the unique solution of a two-dimensional model consisting of a set of variational inequalities that are posed over the abstract completion of a non-empty, closed and convex set. We recall that the two-dimensional limit model obtained departing from Koiter's model is characterised by the same variational inequalities as the two-dimensional model obtained departing from the variational formulation of a three-dimensional linearly elastic generalised membrane shell subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space, with the remarkable difference that the sets where solutions for these two-dimensional limit models are sought do not coincide, in general. In order to complete the justification of Koiter's model for linearly elastic generalised membrane shells of the first kind subjected to remaining confined in a half-space, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the sets where solutions for these two-dimensional limit models are sought coincide.</description>

      <title>On sharp anisotropic Hardy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Yanyan Li and Xukai Yan showed the following interesting Hardy inequalities with anisotropic weights: Let $n\geq 2$, $p \geq 1$, $p\alpha &gt; 1-n$, $p(\alpha + \beta)&gt; -n$, then there exists $C &gt; 0$ such that $$\||x|^{\beta}|x'|^{\alpha+1} \nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)} \geq C\||x|^\beta|x'|^\alpha u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \quad \forall\; u\in C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ Here $x' = (x_1,\ldots, x_{n-1}, 0)$ for $x = (x_i) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. In this note, we will determine the best constant for the above estimate when $p=2$ or $\beta \geq 0$. Moreover, as refinement for very special case of Li-Yan's result in Adv. Math. 2023, we provide explicit estimate for the anisotropic $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a certain type of noisy tug-of-war game which can be regarded as an interpretation of a certain type of boundary value problem for the normalized $p$-Laplace equation, where $1&lt;p&lt;2$. More precisely, we will investigate the boundary regularity of the value function to the game and its convergence to a viscosity solution of the model problem.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation, Taylor Dispersion, and Inviscid Damping of Couette flow in the Boussinesq system on the Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantitative asymptotic stability of the stably stratified Couette flow solution to the 2D fully dissipative nonlinear Boussinesq system on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with large Richardson number $R &gt; 1/4$, viscosity $\nu$ and density dissipation $\kappa$. For an initial perturbation $(\omega_{in}, \theta_{in})$ of size $\mu^{1/2 + \epsilon}$ in a low-order anisotropic Sobolev space, for $\mu$ roughly $\min(\nu, \kappa)\left(1 - O(1/\sqrt{R})\right)$ and $\nu$, $\kappa$ comparable, we demonstrate asymptotic stability with explicit enhanced dissipation and Taylor dispersion rates of decay. We also give inviscid damping estimates on the velocity $u$ and the density $\theta$. This is the first result of its type for the Boussinesq system on the fully unbounded domain $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also translate some known linear results from $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$, and we give an alternative theorem for the nonlinear result.</description>

      <title>Weak-Strong Uniqueness and the d'Alembert Paradox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove conditional weak-strong uniqueness of the potential Euler solution for external flow around a smooth body in three space dimensions, within the class of viscosity weak solutions with the same initial data. Our sufficient condition is the vanishing of the streamwise component of the skin friction in the inviscid limit, somewhat weaker than the condition of Bardos-Titi in bounded domains. Because global-in-time existence of the smooth potential solution leads back to the d'Alembert paradox, we argue that weak-strong uniqueness is not a valid criterion for "relevant" notions of generalized Euler solution and that our condition is likely to be violated in the inviscid limit. We prove also that the Drivas-Nguyen condition on uniform continuity at the wall of the normal velocity component implies weak-strong uniqueness within the general class of admissible weak Euler solutions in bounded domains.</description>

      <title>On a coupled system of KP-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A defining characteristic of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) model equation is that the well-posedness results are subject to the restriction that at all transverse positions, the mass $\int u \,dx = \text{constant independent of $y$}.$ In 2007, for a rather general class of equations of KP type, it was shown that the zero-mass (in $x$) constraint is satisfied at any non-zero time even if it is not satisfied at initial time zero. To remedy this ``odd'' behavior, a model modification is introduced which does not impose non-physical restrictions upon the initial data. In this article, we introduce a new modified KP system, named the Non-KP model equation. After providing a variational derivation of the Non-KP model, we analyze its Hamiltonian evolutionary structure. Furthermore, we prove linear estimates in the Bourgain spaces $X^{s,b}$ corresponding to the integral equation arising from the Duhamel formulation of system.</description>

      <title>On the blowup of quantitative unique continuation estimates for waves and applications to stability estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the blowup of a geometric constant $\mathfrak{C}(\delta)$ appearing in the optimal quantitative unique continuation property for wave operators. In a particular geometric context we prove an upper bound for $\mathfrak{C}(\delta)$ as $\delta$ goes to $0$. Here $\delta&gt;0$ denotes the distance to the maximal unique continuation domain. As applications we obtain stability estimates for the unique continuation property up to the maximal domain. Using our abstract framework~\cite{FO25abstract} we also derive a stability estimate for a hyperbolic inverse problem. The proof is based on a global explicit Carleman estimate combined with the propagation techniques of Laurent-L\'eautaud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calder\'on's inverse conductivity problem has, so far, only been subject to conditional logarithmic stability for infinite-dimensional classes of conductivities and to Lipschitz stability when restricted to finite-dimensional classes. Focusing our attention on the unit ball domain in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$, we give an elementary proof that there are (infinitely many) infinite-dimensional classes of conductivities for which there is Lipschitz stability. In particular, Lipschitz stability holds for general expansions of conductivities, allowing all angular frequencies but with limited freedom in the radial direction, if the basis coefficients decay fast enough to overcome the growth of the basis functions near the domain boundary. We construct general $d$-dimensional Zernike bases and prove that they provide examples of infinite-dimensional Lipschitz stability.</description>

      <title>Almost global existence for Hamiltonian PDEs on compact manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an abstract result of almost global existence of small solutions to semi-linear Hamiltonian partial differential equations satisfying very weak non resonance conditions and basic multilinear estimates. Thanks to works by Delort--Szeftel, these assumptions turn out to typically hold for Hamiltonian PDEs on any smooth compact boundaryless Riemannian manifold. As a main application, we prove the almost global existence of small solutions to nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on such manifolds: for almost all mass, any arbitrarily large $r$ and sufficiently large $s$, solutions with initial data of sufficiently small size $\varepsilon \ll 1$ in the Sobolev space $H^s \times H^{s-1}$ exist and remain in $H^s \times H^{s-1}$ for polynomial times $|t| \leq \varepsilon^{-r}$. This is the first result of almost global existence without specific assumptions on the compact manifold.  We also apply this abstract result to nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations close to ground states and nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive quadratic potentials.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to state and prove existence and uniqueness results for a general elliptic problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, often associated with image processing tasks like denoising. The novelty is that we surpass the lack of coercivity of the Euler-Lagrange functional with an innovative technique that has at its core the idea of showing that the minimum of the energy functional over a subset of the space $W^{1,p(x)}(\Omega)$ coincides with the global minimum. The obtained existence result applies to multiple-phase elliptic problems under remarkably weak assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linearized two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation around a vortex of degree one, with data in the same equivariance class. Various estimates are proved for the solution; in particular, conditions for optimal decay in $L^\infty$ and boundedness in $L^2$ are identified. The analysis relies on a full description of the spectral resolution of the linearized operator through the associated distorted Fourier transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plateau problems with elastic boundary energies have been of recent theoretical and applied interest. However, strong assumptions have to be made to avoid self-intersections of the boundary curve during energy minimization. We introduce a class of Plateau problems for boundaries with self-repulsive energies that obviates self-contact in energy minimization problems. For the self-repulsive energy, we choose the M\"obius Energy introduced by O'Hara due to its myriad regularity properties shown by Freedman et al. We first prove an existence theorem for this M\"obius-Plateau problem in the class of closed Lipschitz curves of a given irreducible knot-type spanned by immersed discs. We then turn our attention to M\"obius-Plateau variations of helicoidal strips, which are classified as "screw-like" or "ribbon-like" based on the signs of the radii of the boundary helices. By analyzing the Euler-Lagrange equations, we show that screw-like solutions are plentiful, whilst ribbon-like solutions impose strong constraints on their parameters: they must have high frequency (equivalently, low pitch), thin width in comparison to the frequency, and remain close to the axis.</description>

      <title>Edge states in super honeycomb structures with PT-symmetric deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of edge states is one of the most vital properties of topological insulators. Although tremendous success has been accomplished in describing and explaining edge states associated with PT symmetry breaking, little work has been done on PT symmetry preserving cases. Two-dimensional Schroedinger operators with super honeycomb lattice potentials always have double Dirac cones at the Gamma point - the zero momentum point on their energy bands due to C6 symmetry, PT symmetry, and the "folding" symmetry - caused by an additional translation symmetry. There are two topologically different ways to deform such a system by PT symmetry preserving but folding symmetry breaking perturbations. Interestingly, there exist two gapped edge states on the interface between such two kinds of perturbed materials. In this paper, we illustrate the existence of such PT preserving edge states rigorously for the first time. We use a domain wall modulated Schroedinger operator to model the phenomenon under small perturbations and rigorously prove the existence of two gapped edge states. We also provide a brief interpretation from the point of view of "topology" by the parities of degenerate bulk modes. Our work thoroughly explains the existence of "helical" like edge states in super honeycomb configurations and lays a foundation for the descriptions of topologies of such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

      <title>A semigroup approach to the reconstruction theorem and the multilevel Schauder estimate for singular modelled distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the semigroup approach used in [23,21] to provide alternative proofs of the reconstruction theorem and the multilevel Schauder estimate for singular modelled distributions. As an application of them, we construct the local-in-time solution of the two dimensional parabolic Anderson model with a non-translation invariant differential operator.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear stochastic fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon our study of the sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}, this paper seeks to further refine the main results presented in \cite{CenSong2412} in the following key aspects. Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of General Nonlocal Epidemic Models with Age and Space Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a class of general nonlinear epidemic models with age and space structure, including a nonlocal infection term depending on age and space. After establishing the well-posedness of the state partial differential equation, we introduce a control parameter interpreted as a vaccination rate. Under certain conditions, we show that an optimal control exists and how it can be characterized by first-order optimality conditions. Finally, we present numerical examples of the optimal control problems governed by these models.</description>
