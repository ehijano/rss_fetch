      <title>Enhancing Emotion Recognition in Incomplete Data: A Novel Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition systems rely heavily on the full availability of modalities, suffering significant performance declines when modal data is incomplete. To tackle this issue, we present the Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement (CM-ARR) framework, an innovative approach that sequentially engages in cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement phases to handle missing modalities and enhance emotion recognition. This framework utilizes unsupervised distribution-based contrastive learning to align heterogeneous modal distributions, reducing discrepancies and modeling semantic uncertainty effectively. The reconstruction phase applies normalizing flow models to transform these aligned distributions and recover missing modalities. The refinement phase employs supervised point-based contrastive learning to disrupt semantic correlations and accentuate emotional traits, thereby enriching the affective content of the reconstructed representations. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets confirm the superior performance of CM-ARR under conditions of both missing and complete modalities. Notably, averaged across six scenarios of missing modalities, CM-ARR achieves absolute improvements of 2.11% in WAR and 2.12% in UAR on the IEMOCAP dataset, and 1.71% and 1.96% in WAR and UAR, respectively, on the MSP-IMPROV dataset.</description>

      <title>HPC: Hierarchical Progressive Coding Framework for Volumetric Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumetric video based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) holds vast potential for various 3D applications, but its substantial data volume poses significant challenges for compression and transmission. Current NeRF compression lacks the flexibility to adjust video quality and bitrate within a single model for various network and device capacities. To address these issues, we propose HPC, a novel hierarchical progressive volumetric video coding framework achieving variable bitrate using a single model. Specifically, HPC introduces a hierarchical representation with a multi-resolution residual radiance field to reduce temporal redundancy in long-duration sequences while simultaneously generating various levels of detail. Then, we propose an end-to-end progressive learning approach with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to jointly optimize both hierarchical representation and compression. Our HPC trained only once can realize multiple compression levels, while the current methods need to train multiple fixed-bitrate models for different rate-distortion (RD) tradeoffs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPC achieves flexible quality levels with variable bitrate by a single model and exhibits competitive RD performance, even outperforming fixed-bitrate models across various datasets.</description>
