      <title>Nearest Neighbor CCP-Based Molecular Sequence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular sequence analysis is crucial for comprehending several biological processes, including protein-protein interactions, functional annotation, and disease classification. The large number of sequences and the inherently complicated nature of protein structures make it challenging to analyze such data. Finding patterns and enhancing subsequent research requires the use of dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches. Recently, a method called Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) has been proposed as an effective method for biological sequencing data. The CCP technique is still costly to compute even though it is effective for sequence visualization. Furthermore, its utility for classifying molecular sequences is still uncertain. To solve these two problems, we present a Nearest Neighbor Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP-NN)-based technique for efficiently preprocessing molecular sequence data. To group related molecular sequences and produce representative supersequences, CCP makes use of sequence-to-sequence correlations. As opposed to conventional methods, CCP doesn't rely on matrix diagonalization, therefore it can be applied to a range of machine-learning problems. We estimate the density map and compute the correlation using a nearest-neighbor search technique. We performed molecular sequence classification using CCP and CCP-NN representations to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach. Our findings show that CCP-NN considerably improves classification task accuracy as well as significantly outperforms CCP in terms of computational runtime.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Key Genes Correlated to the Subretinal Lesion Severity in a Mouse Model of Age-Related Macular Degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in older adults, severely affecting vision and quality of life. Despite advances in understanding AMD, the molecular factors driving the severity of subretinal scarring (fibrosis) remain elusive, hampering the development of effective therapies. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework to predict key genes that are strongly correlated with lesion severity and to identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent subretinal fibrosis in AMD. Using an original RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset from the diseased retinas of JR5558 mice, we developed a novel and specific feature engineering technique, including pathway-based dimensionality reduction and gene-based feature expansion, to enhance prediction accuracy. Two iterative experiments were conducted by leveraging Ridge and ElasticNet regression models to assess biological relevance and gene impact. The results highlight the biological significance of several key genes and demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in identifying novel therapeutic targets. The key findings provide valuable insights for advancing drug discovery efforts and improving treatment strategies for AMD, with the potential to enhance patient outcomes by targeting the underlying genetic mechanisms of subretinal lesion development.</description>

      <title>Advancements in practical k-mer sets: essentials for the curious</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of data structures for representing k-mer sets, which are fundamental in high-throughput sequencing analysis. It categorizes the methods into two main strategies: those using fingerprinting and hashing for compact storage, and those leveraging lexicographic properties for efficient representation. The paper reviews key operations supported by these structures, such as membership queries and dynamic updates, and highlights recent advancements in memory efficiency and query speed. A companion paper explores colored k-mer sets, which extend these concepts to integrate multiple datasets or genomes.</description>

      <title>Advancements in colored k-mer sets: essentials for the curious</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in k-mer-based data structures representing collections of several samples (sometimes called colored de Bruijn graphs) and their applications in large-scale sequence indexing and pangenomics. The review explores the evolution of k-mer set representations, highlighting the trade-offs between exact and inexact methods, as well as the integration of compression strategies and modular implementations. I discuss the impact of these structures on practical applications and describe recent utilization of these methods for analysis. By surveying the state-of-the-art techniques and identifying emerging trends, this work aims to guide researchers in selecting and developing methods for large scale and reference-free genomic data. For a broader overview of k-mer set representations and foundational data structures, see the accompanying article on practical k-mer sets.</description>

      <title>Selecting Differential Splicing Methods: Practical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Additionally, advancements in long-read RNA sequencing are expected to drive the evolution of differential splicing tools, reducing the need for isoform deconvolution and prompting further innovation.</description>

      <title>CRADLE-VAE: Enhancing Single-Cell Gene Perturbation Modeling with Counterfactual Reasoning-based Artifact Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to various perturbations is a critical focus in drug discovery and personalized therapeutics, with deep learning models playing a significant role in this endeavor. Single-cell datasets contain technical artifacts that may hinder the predictability of such models, which poses quality control issues highly regarded in this area. To address this, we propose CRADLE-VAE, a causal generative framework tailored for single-cell gene perturbation modeling, enhanced with counterfactual reasoning-based artifact disentanglement. Throughout training, CRADLE-VAE models the underlying latent distribution of technical artifacts and perturbation effects present in single-cell datasets. It employs counterfactual reasoning to effectively disentangle such artifacts by modulating the latent basal spaces and learns robust features for generating cellular response data with improved quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves not only treatment effect estimation performance but also generative quality as well. The CRADLE-VAE codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/CRADLE-VAE.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Enumeration in Models of Genome Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of enumeration in certain genome rearrangement models. We first show that the Pairwise Rearrangement problem in the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010) is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete under polynomial-time Turing reductions. Next, we show that in the Single Cut or Join model (Feijao &amp; Meidanis, IEEE ACM Trans. Comp. Biol. Bioinf. 2011), the problem of enumerating all medians ($\#$Median) is logspace-computable ($\textsf{FL}$), improving upon the previous polynomial-time ($\textsf{FP}$) bound of Mikl\'os &amp; Smith (RECOMB 2015).</description>
