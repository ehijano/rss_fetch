      <title>Minimizing Space Charge Tune Spread and Increasing Beam Quality Parameters with Circular Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space charge has been a limiting factor for low energy accelerators inducing emittance growth and tune spread. Tune shift and tune spread parameters are important for avoiding resonances, which limit intensity of the beam. Circular modes are round beams with intrinsic flatness that are generated through strong coupling, where intrinsic flatness can be transformed to real space flatness through decoupling. It is understood that flat beams increase beam quality parameters, such as beam brightness and collision luminosity, due to one of the planes' emittance being much smaller than in the other plane, and since both luminosity and beam brightness depend inversely on the beam emittances. We show that circular mode beams manifest smaller space charge tune spread compared to uncorrelated round beams, which allows better control of beam quality. Minimized tune spread allows more flexible operating points on the tune map.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the nonlinear diffusion of the proton beam halo at the CERN LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In circular particle accelerators, storage rings, or colliders, mitigating beam losses is critical to ensuring optimal performance, particularly for rings that include superconducting magnets. A thorough understanding of beam-halo dynamics is essential for this purpose. This paper presents recent results for the measurement of the nonlinear diffusion process of the beam halo at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The novel approach used in this paper is based on the analytical framework of the Nekhoroshev theorem, which provides a functional form for the diffusion coefficient. By monitoring the beam loss signal during controlled movements of the collimator jaws, we determine the beam losses at equilibrium for various amplitudes and analyze the beam-halo distribution. Post-processing of these measurements provides the nonlinear diffusion coefficient, which is found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical assumptions. Measurements from an experiment investigating the effectiveness of beam-beam compensation using beam-beam compensation wires also provide a direct assessment of the compensation's effectiveness on beam-tail diffusion.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings III. Symmetric map with mixed nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article extends the study of dynamical properties of the symmetric McMillan map, emphasizing its utility in understanding and modeling complex nonlinear systems. Although the map features six parameters, we demonstrate that only two are irreducible: the linearized rotation number at the fixed point and a nonlinear parameter representing the ratio of terms in the biquadratic invariant. Through a detailed analysis, we classify regimes of stable motion, provide exact solutions to the mapping equations, and derive a canonical set of action-angle variables, offering analytical expressions for the rotation number and nonlinear tune shift. We further establish connections between general standard-form mappings and the symmetric McMillan map, using the area-preserving H\'eon map and accelerator lattices with thin sextupole magnet as representative case studies. Our results show that, despite being a second-order approximation, the symmetric McMillan map provides a highly accurate depiction of dynamics across a wide range of system parameters, demonstrating its practical relevance in both theoretical and applied contexts.</description>
