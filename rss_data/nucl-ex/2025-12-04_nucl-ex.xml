      <title>Precision Measurements of Kinematic Scan for Fluctuations of (Net-)proton Multiplicity Distributions in Au+Au Collisions from RHIC-STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents measurements of the rapidity-window dependence of event-by-event net-proton cumulants and proton factorial cumulants in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$7.7 -- 27 GeV, using high-statistics data from RHIC BES-II. Protons and antiprotons are identified with improved detector performance within $0.4&lt;p_\mathrm{T}&lt;2.0$ GeV/$c$ and $|y|&lt;0.6$, enabling a wide coverage in momentum space to probe long-range correlations near the QCD critical point. In the most central collisions, the proton number $\kappa_2/\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_3/\kappa_1$ exhibit power-law scaling with the rapidity window, but with exponents below the theoretical expectation, suggesting that the critical point, if it exists, may lie at higher baryon densities. A finite-size scaling analysis of the susceptibility and Binder cumulant study points out a critical baryon chemical potential region in 550 -- 650 MeV.</description>

      <title>Compton suppressed scintillation spectrometer based on a cluster of 9$\times$CeBr$_{3}$-NaI(Tl) phoswich detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the characteristics of an Compton suppressed spectrometer consisting of 9$\times$CeBr$_{3}$-NaI(Tl) phoswich detectors surrounded by four CsI(Tl) scintillation detectors intended for suppressing the Compton component of the spectrum have been carried out. Measurements were performed using gamma and neutron radiation sources. Key parameters of the spectrometer have been determined: the suppression factor of the Compton part of the $\gamma$-spectrum, as well as the dependencies of the neutron detection efficiency on their energy at various detection threshold values.</description>

      <title>Understanding the correlation between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative correlation between the magnitudes of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) has been accurately measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC collider. As a function of the centrality of the collision, it changes sign and varies non-monotonically. We show that this is naturally explained by two combined effects. The first effect is a skewness in initial-state fluctuations, which is quantified by the correlation between the geometry-driven elliptic deformation in the reaction plane and the fluctuation-driven triangularity $\varepsilon_3$. We introduce an intensive measure of this skewness, which is generically of order unity and depends weakly on the system size and centrality. We evaluate its magnitude using Monte Carlo simulations of the initial state, which show that it is sensitive to the nucleon width. The second effect is the fluctuation of impact parameter relative to centrality classifiers used by experiment. The ATLAS collaboration uses two different centrality classifiers, the multiplicity $N_{ch}$ and the transverse energy $E_T$. We fit both sets of results for Pb+Pb collisions up to $\approx 40\%$ centrality with a single parameter, the intensive mixed skewness. Its value inferred from experiment agrees with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Validating a Machine Learning Approach to Identify Quenched Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet quenching is a phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions arising from jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Its study is complicated by the interplay of multiple physics processes that affect jet observables. In addition, detector effects may influence the results and must be accounted for when identifying quenched jets. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure, incorporating parton shower history, to predict jet-by-jet quenching levels. Using photon-jet samples from the \textsc{Jewel} event generator, we show that the LSTM predictions strongly correlate with true jet energy loss. This validates that the model effectively learns the features of jet-QGP interaction. We simulate detector effects using \textsc{Delphes} simulation framework and demonstrate that the method identifies quenching effects in a realistic environment. We test the approach with photon-jet momentum imbalance, jet fragmentation function, and jet shape, which were not included in the training, confirming its ability to distinguish true quenching features.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>
