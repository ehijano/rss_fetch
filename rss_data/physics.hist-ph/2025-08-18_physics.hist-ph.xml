      <title>Vishap stelae as cult dedicated prehistoric monuments of Armenian Highlands: data analysis and interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vishaps, or dragon stones, are prehistoric stelae discovered in the high-altitude mountainous regions of modern-day Armenia and adjacent regions. The first statistical analysis of their elevation distribution and size reveals that their construction was intentionally labor-intensive rather than arbitrary. The findings support the hypothesis that vishaps were closely associated with an ancient water cult, as they are predominantly situated near water sources, including high-altitude springs and discovered prehistoric irrigation systems. Furthermore, the unexpected bimodal distribution of their altitudes suggests specific placement patterns, potentially linked to seasonal human activities or ritual practices. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the symbolic and functional significance of vishap stelae within the framework of prehistoric social and religious systems.</description>

      <title>Personal Memories of 50 Years of Quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The world of particle physics was revolutionised in November 1974 by the discovery of the J/psi particle, the first particle to be identified as a quarkonium state composed of charm quarks and antiquarks. The charmonium interpretation of the J/psi was cemented by the subsequent observations of a spectrum of related c \bar c states, and finally by the discovery of charmed particles in 1976. The discovery of charmonium was followed in 1977 by the discovery of bottomonium mesons and particles containing bottom quarks. Toponium bound states of top quark and antiquarks were predicted to exist in principle but, following the discovery of the top quark in 1995, most physicists thought that its observation would have to wait for next-generation e^+ e^- collider. However, in the second half of 2024 the CMS Collaboration reported an excess of events near the threshold for \bar t t production at the LHC that is most plausibly interpreted as the lowest-lying toponium state. These are the personal recollections of an eyewitness who followed closely these 50 years of quarkonium discoveries.</description>
