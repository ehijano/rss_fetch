      <title>Healing of the edge magnetic island in the island divertor configuration on J-TEXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomena of island healing and configuration transition induced by high-power electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) have been investigated in the island divertor configuration on the J-TEXT tokamak. Experimental results reveal that the size of the edge open magnetic island with mode number m/n = 3/1 decreases substantially under specific ECRH conditions. This process, referred to as island healing, occurs when ECRH with a power of 500~600 kW is deposited in the plasma core or when 250 kW of ECRH is deposited at r = 0.5 a, where a is the minor radius. The reduction of the island width makes the island divertor ineffective and transition into the limiter configuration. A model incorporating the influence of ECRH on the scrape-off layer (SOL) thermoelectric current is proposed to explain the observed changes in the edge magnetic topology of the island divertor configuration. These findings suggest that ECRH should be deposited at the plasma core with carefully controlled power to ensure the stable and compatible operation of ECRH and the island divertor configuration in tokamaks. The results can provide insights into achieving robust operation of an island divertor in tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the "return stroke"-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed pulse shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component -type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a singular mode of charge transfer with a range of junction-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>

      <title>Parallel Electric Fields And Electron Heating Observed In The Young Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics framework coupled with smoothed particle hydrodynamics for quantum plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for modelling quantum plasmas in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime via a hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamic - molecular dynamic treatment, here referred to as 'Bohm SPH'. This treatment is founded upon Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics for partially degenerate fluids, does not apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and is computationally tractable, capable of modelling dynamics over ionic timescales at electronic time resolution. Bohm SPH is also capable of modelling non-Gaussian electron wavefunctions. We present an overview of our methodology, validation tests of the single particle case including the hydrogen 1s wavefunction, and comparisons to simulations of a warm dense hydrogen system performed with wave packet molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>A transformational approach to collective behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a revolutionary approach to the characterization, forecast, and control of collective systems. Collective systems are an ensemble of conservatively interacting entities. The evolution of the entities are determined by symmetries of the entities. Collective systems take many different forms. A plasma is a collective of charged particles, a fluid is a collective of molecules, a elementary field is a collective of elementary particles, and a cosmos is a collective of celestial bodies. Our new theory builds on the canonical transformation approach to dynamics. This approach recognizes that the symmetry leads to the conservation of a real function, that is the infinitesimal generator of a Lie group. The finite generator of the canonical transformation is derived from the infinitesimal generator by the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This generating function is also known as the action, the entropy, and the logarithmic likelihood. The new theory generalizes this generating function to the generating functional of the collective field. Finally, this paper derives the formula for the Mayer Cluster Expansion, or the S-matrix expansion of the generating functional. We call it the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). Practically, this is a localized Fourier Transformation, whose principal components give the singularity spectrums, that is the solution to the Renormalization Group Equations. Limitations on the measurement of the system (that is the Born Rule and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) lead to quantization of the stochastic probabilities of the collective field. How different collective systems couple together to form systems-of-systems is formalized. The details of a practical implementation of the HST will be presented.</description>

      <title>A novel understanding of the role of plasma-molecular kinetics on divertor power exhaust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14403v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During detachment, a buffer of neutral atoms and molecules builds up between the target and the ionising plasma. Collisions between the plasma and the molecules play an important role in the detachment process. Studies of plasma-molecular kinetics indicate that the gas temperature is increased during detachment for a wide range of conditions on the MAST-U and TCV tokamaks. This is related to an increased $\mathrm{D}_2$ lifetime during detachment, leading to more plasma-molecule collisions that raise the molecular temperature. Such collisions subsequently result in significant power and momentum losses to the divertor plasma during detachment. Using a simplified inference, these losses are estimated using the rotational temperature, neutral pressure and ionisation front position. Significant power losses (about $10\%$ of $P_{SOL}$) and dominant momentum losses (majority of the upstream pressure) from plasma-molecule collisions are inferred experimentally in long-legged, strongly baffled, detached divertors (MAST-U Super-X divertor), consistent with SOLPS-ITER simulations. The vibrational distribution obtained is compared to a collisional-radiative model setup using the same rate data as SOLPS-ITER, indicating some qualitative agreements and disagreements, potentially highlighting model gaps with regard to the default rates used.
  These interpretations highlight the importance of plasma-molecular collisions, leading to power and momentum losses during detachment. Our analysis and reduced modelling of these processes provide further insights into detachment control observations, the workings of long-legged divertors and divertor power balance.</description>

      <title>The neutron spectral moments method in the time-of-flight domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analysis methodology is developed for the time-of-flight (TOF) signals recorded by two or more collinear neutron detectors located at different distances from a pulsed neutron source. It is based on taking central moments of the TOF signals and relating these to a set of co-moments of the distribution of production times and velocities of neutrons emitted towards the detectors. Given n detectors, we can obtain all such co-moments of order n-1 and lower. Co-moments contain information on the time-varying behaviour of the neutron source. A physical interpretation is provided for several co-moments of interest.</description>

      <title>Data-driven methods to discover stable linear models of the helicity injectors on HIT-SIU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient circuit models are necessary to control the power electronic circuits found on plasma physics experiments. Tuning and controlling the behavior of these circuits is inextricably linked to plasma performance. Linear models are greatly preferred for control applications due to their well-established performance guarantees, but they typically fail to capture nonlinear dynamics and changes in experimental parameters. Data-driven system identification can help mitigate these shortcomings by learning interpretable and accurate reduced-order models of a complex system, in this case the injector circuits of the Helicity Injected Torus - Steady Inductive Upgrade (HIT-SIU) experiment. Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of the interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume, and the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an analytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as well as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a plasma is present. BOP-DMD is then fit on experimental data, both on shots with and without a plasma in the confinement volume. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of data-driven methods to produce stable, linear models for control and uncertainty quantification in plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Reality of inverse cascading in neutron star crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The braking torque that dictates the timing properties of magnetars is closely tied to the large-scale dipolar magnetic field on their surface. The formation of this field has been a topic of ongoing debate. One proposed mechanism, based on macroscopic principles, involves an inverse cascade within the neutron star's crust. However, this phenomenon has not been observed in realistic simulations. In this study, we provide compelling evidence supporting the feasibility of the inverse cascading process in the presence of an initial helical magnetic field within realistic neutron star crusts and discuss its contribution to the amplification of the large-scale magnetic field. Our findings, derived from a systematic investigation that considers various coordinate systems, peak wavenumber positions, crustal thicknesses, magnetic boundary conditions, and magnetic Lundquist numbers, reveal that the specific geometry of the crustal domain-with its extreme aspect ratio-requires an initial peak wavenumber from small-scale structures for the inverse cascade to occur. However, this same aspect ratio confines the cascade to structures on the scale of the crust, making the formation of a large-scale dipolar surface field unlikely. Despite these limitations, the inverse cascade remains a significant factor in the magnetic field evolution within the crust and may help explain highly magnetized objects with weak surface dipolar fields, such as low-field magnetars and central compact objects.</description>

      <title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power of the black hole. The sheath is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains. About 20% of the sheath power is dissipated between 2 and 10 gravitational radii. The plasma in the dissipative sheath moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim 0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed soft photons into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.</description>
