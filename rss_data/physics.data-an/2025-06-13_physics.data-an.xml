      <title>Self-learning signal classifier for decameter coherent scatter radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of 10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.</description>

      <title>Under-coverage in high-statistics counting experiments with finite MC samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of setting confidence intervals on a parameter of interest from the maximum-likelihood fit of a physics model to a binned data set with a large number of bins, large event-counts per bin, and in the presence of systematic uncertainties modeled as nuisance parameters. We use the profile-likelihood ratio for statistical inference and focus on the case in which the model is determined from Monte Carlo simulated samples of finite size. We start by presenting a toy model in which the asymptotic properties of the profile-likelihood ratio are manifestly broken even if the numbers of events per bin in both the data and simulated samples are seemingly large enough to warrant their validity. We then move to the general setting to show how statistical uncertainties in the Monte Carlo predictions can affect the coverage of confidence intervals constructed in the asymptotic approximation always in the same direction, namely they lead to systematic under-coverage.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Topological Partitioning of a Large-Scale Real-World Network: Scale-Free Properties and Minimal Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale, real-world growing network connecting software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network comprises approximately 6 billion nodes and edges and spans more than 40 years of growth. Our analysis leverages natural partitions of nodes and edges, based on both temporal and topological attributes.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a global bow-tie-like structure and enables a preliminary investigation of edge dynamics (such as creation, inheritance, and aging) alongside comparisons with minimal models. We analyze degree distributions over time, edge timestamp histograms, and estimates of the in-degree distribution's scaling exponent. The results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and to the presence of numerous outliers, while showing that the proposed partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  Node types derived from topological and temporal partitions reveal regime shifts associated with changes in developer practices, notably variations in the average number of new edges per new node over time. These structural and dynamical transitions hinder definitive conclusions regarding the existence and observability of a scale-free regime, and underscore the need for advanced tools to study transient growth phases and to facilitate robust comparisons between real-world evolving networks and minimal models.</description>
