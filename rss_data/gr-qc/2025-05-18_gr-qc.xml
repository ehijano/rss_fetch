      <title>Graviton-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics probes the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalence principle for test gravitational physics strongly constrains dynamics of spacetime, providing a powerful criterion for selecting candidate theories of gravity. However, checking its validity for a particular theory is often a very difficult task. We devise here a simple theoretical criterion for identifying equivalence principle violations in black hole thermodynamics. Employing this criterion, we prove that Lanczos-Lovelock gravity violates the strong equivalence principle, leaving general relativity as the only local, diffeomorphism-invariant theory compatible with it. However, we also show that certain nonlocal expressions for black hole entropy appear to obey the strong equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Einstein Telescope an Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this talk is to give an overview of the current status of the development of the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer ground based gravitational wave (GW) detectors and of their foreseen scientific goals. These detectors will be up to a factor 8 more sensitive across the band covered by current detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, and will extend the accessible frequency band towards the low frequency regime, i.e., below 10 Hz. These improvements will not only enhance the number and quality of GW observations, but will also enable researchers to have access to sources and physical processes which are out of reach for current detectors and explore the possibility of detecting previously unknown GW sources. The improvement in sensitivity in the low frequency regime will also increase the observation time of compact binary coalescence events, strengthening the collaboration with electromagnetic observatories for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star events. In fact, current detectors proved that joint observations of GW events with electromagnetic observatories are not only possible, but they can also give us unprecedented insights on the underlying physics of astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Can we distinguish whether black holes have singularities or not through echoes and light rings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent work [Phys. Rev. D 111, 104040] shows that the curvature singularity of a black hole can vanish at a fine-tuned mass value, which implies that regular black holes could be special states in black hole evolution. We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Bardeen black hole and its singular counterparts under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations, employing the WKB method and time-domain analysis, respectively. The time-domain analysis results suggest that echo signals may emerge in the QNMs of singular black hole states. Furthermore, we investigate the null geodesics of these black holes. We find that a black hole with singularity may possess two light rings, whereas regular black holes consistently maintain only one light ring. Similar conclusions are also valid for the regular Hayward black hole and its singular counterparts.</description>

      <title>Inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms with gravitational self-force results within the effective-one-body formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational self-force (GSF) theory is a strong-gravity perturbative approach to the relativistic two-body problem, primarily developed to model extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where one compact object is significantly more massive than the companion. However, recent advancements in GSF calculations, particularly involving second-order self-force (2GSF) results, indicated a much broader applicability across a wider range of mass ratios. These developments have motivated efforts to incorporate GSF results into the effective-one-body (EOB) framework, where they have already been successfully integrated into the state-of-the-art waveform model, SEOBNRv5, employed in recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs. In this work, we present SEOBNR-GSF, a nonspinning inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) EOB waveform model that introduces a GSF-informed EOB Hamiltonian as its central innovation. This marks the first complete IMR waveform model constructed primarily from GSF results. We show that our model outperforms inspiral waveforms from full 2GSF calculations in the intermediate-to-comparable mass regime. Furthermore, by comparing with a post-Newtonian-informed variant, SEOBNR-GSF-PN, we demonstrate that the inclusion of numerical GSF information in the Hamiltonian leads to significant improvements in model fidelity. Finally, we benchmark our model against high-accuracy, nonspinning numerical-relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) catalogue and find that its median mismatch is comparable to that of SEOBNRv5, suggesting that this approach holds promise for further enhancing future EOB waveform models.</description>

      <title>On Kerr black hole formation with complete apparent horizon and a new approach toward Penrose inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arising from admissible extended scale-critical short-pulse initial data, we show that 3+1 dimensional Einstein vacuum equations admit dynamical Kerr black hole formation solutions. Our hyperbolic arguments combine the scale-critical gravitational-collapse result by An--Luk with the recent breakthrough by Klainerman--Szeftel on proving nonlinear Kerr stability with small angular momentum, which requires us to perform various specific coordinate changes and frame transformations. Furthermore, allowing large spacetime angular momentum, with new elliptic arguments and precise leading order calculations, we also solve the apparent horizon in Kerr black hole formation spacetimes (including Klainerman--Szeftel's Kerr stability spacetimes) and conduct an exploration, detailing the emergence, evolution, asymptotics and final state of the apparent horizon. Building on our analysis, without time symmetric assumption, we then put forward a new mathematical framework and prove both the dynamical Penrose inequality and the spacetime Penrose inequality in our black-hole formation spacetimes and in the perturbative regime of subextremal Kerr black holes. Collectively, without assuming any symmetry, we extend Christodoulou's celebrated trapped surface formation theorem to a black hole formation result.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Structure in Gravitational Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation from known astrophysical sources is conventionally treated classically. This treatment corresponds, implicitly, to the hypothesis that a particular class of quantum-mechanical states -- the so-called coherent states -- adequately describe the gravitational radiation field. We propose practicable, quantitative tests of that hypothesis using resonant bar detectors monitored in coincidence with LIGO-style interferometers. Our tests readily distinguish fields that contain significant thermal components or squeezing. We identify concrete circumstances in which the classical (i.e., coherent state) hypothesis is likely to fail. Such failures are of fundamental interest, in that addressing them requires us to treat the gravitational field quantum-mechanically, and they open a new window into the dynamics of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multi-Species Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Phantom matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability and Critical Exponents of the Neutral (S-type) Gubser-Rocha Model with Momentum Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model, which can be derived from the maximal gauged supergravity in four dimensions. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In this paper, we investigate several aspects of this phase transition. Firstly, we show that the critical exponents of the phase transition match those in the mean-field percolation theory. Subsequently, we also investigate the dynamical stability, and the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes by analyzing the quasinormal modes of the perturbation fields. The dynamical stability agrees with the thermodynamic stability. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a certain class of Lorentzian manifolds, namely causal spacetimes without observer horizons, conformal transformations can be classified into two types: escaping and non-escaping. This means that successive powers of a given conformal transformation will either send all points to infinity, or none. As an application, we classify the conformal transformations of Einstein's static universe. We also study the question of essentiality in this context, i.e. which conformal transformations are isometric for some metric in the conformal class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we investigate the impact of selecting only a subset of bright galaxies to provide redshift information for a dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. Employing gravitational-wave observations from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC-3) in conjunction with the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue, we show that restricting to bright galaxy subsets can enhance the precision of the $H_0$ estimate by up to $80\%$ in the most favorable scenario. A comprehensive assessment of systematic uncertainties is still required. This work lays the foundation for employing alternative tracers -- such as brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and luminous red galaxies (LRGs) -- in gravitational-wave cosmology, particularly at redshifts where conventional galaxy catalogues offer limited coverage.</description>

      <title>Features of the Partition Function of a $\Lambda&gt;0$ Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider properties of the gravitational path integral, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$, of a four-dimensional gravitational effective field theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$ at the quantum level. To leading order, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ is dominated by a four-sphere saddle subject to small fluctuations. Beyond this, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ receives contributions from additional geometries that may include Einstein metrics of positive curvature. We discuss how a general positive curvature Einstein metric contributes to ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ at one-loop level. Along the way, we discuss Einstein-Maxwell theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$, and identify an interesting class of closed non-Einstein gravitational instantons. We provide a detailed study for the specific case of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which is distinguished as the saddle with second largest volume and positive definite tensor eigenspectrum. We present exact one-loop results for scalar particles, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity about the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}P^2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a local, diff-invariant quantum effective action for gravity that captures the trace anomaly via a counter-term. We discuss why this counter-term is the most significant among infinitely many possible ones, and show how the counter-term leads to a scattering amplitude that is strongly coupled at arbitrarily low energies. We show how the introduction of a new sector with spontaneously broken scale invariance removes the strong coupling problem, and discuss some physical consequences due to the new sector. Three Appendices summarize quantum effective actions -- highlighting connections between their local, and seemingly non-local formulations -- for the scale anomaly in 4D QED, for the axial anomaly in 2D QED, and for the scale anomaly in a 2D sigma model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelogram is derived from entangled 6-qubit states. Moreover, the volume of a 3D parallelepiped is deduced from an entangled 9-qubit state. Furthermore, it has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. It is worth mentioning that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin effects in black hole and neutron star binary dynamics: worldline supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of spin effects in the binary dynamics for black hole and neutron stars is crucial for the computation of gravitational wave observables. Worldline supersymmetric models have shown to be particularly efficient at this task up to quadratic order in spin, but progress at higher orders has been hampered by no-go-theorems. In this work we propose a novel approach to overcome this problem by extending the supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by computing an all-order in spin and linear in curvature, manifestly supersymmetric Hamiltonian, as well as a cubic order in spin Hamiltonian in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. In doing so, we identify a criterion that uniquely determines the Kerr geometry in terms of worldline supersymmetry. Equipped with these Hamiltonians, we demonstrate the exponentiation of three-point and Compton amplitudes using the recently proposed Generalized Wilson line approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.00838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula and Charzynski argued that a gravitational wave emitted during the merger of a black hole binary may be approximated by a circularly polarized wave which may in turn trap particles [1]. In this paper we consider particle motion in a class of gravitational waves which includes, besides circularly polarized periodic waves (CPP) [2], also the one proposed by Lukash [3] to study anisotropic cosmological models. Both waves have a 7-parameter conformal symmetry which contains, in addition to the generic 5-parameter (broken) Carroll group, also a 6th isometry. The Lukash spacetime can be transformed by a conformal rescaling of time to a perturbed CPP problem. Bounded geodesics, found both analytically and numerically, arise when the Lukash wave is of Bianchi type VI. Their symmetries can also be derived from the Lukash-CPP relation. Particle trapping is discussed.</description>

      <title>Gaussian beams and caustic avoidance in gravitational optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a beam summation method adapted from the semiclassical regime of quantum mechanics to study the classical properties of thin light bundles in gravity. In Newtonian paraxial optics, this method has been shown to encapsulate the wave properties of the light beams. In our case, the wave function assigned to the light bundle can be viewed as a coarse-grained description that captures information about the dynamics of superposed bundles within the geometric optics regime. We investigate two solutions of the null bundle wave function that differ by their origin: (i) a point source and (ii) a finite source. It is shown that while the wave function in the point source case contains the same information as the standard thin null bundle framework, the finite source case corresponds to a Gaussian beam. The novel aspect of this work arises from our geometric construction of covariant Gaussian beams, which can be applied in any spacetime. Additionally, the effects of a finite source on cosmological distances are discussed. With this framework, one can model light propagation from coherent sources while avoiding the mathematical singularities of the standard thin null bundle formalism. We explicitly demonstrate the caustic-avoidance property of Gaussian beams in the analytically tractable example of a Barriola-Vilenkin monopole spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.</description>

Abstract: After studying properties of the Nariai solution, including its geodesics, in spherical and de Sitter coordinates, two kinds of accelerated motion are investigated in detail: either observers at rest with respect to the coordinates, or observers in radial motion. Next, massless scalar perturbations of Nariai spacetime in absence of sources are worked out, and an explicit example out of the black hole context of analytic self-force calculation is obtained. Last, self-force effects are studied as well, together with some variant of the type of Poynting-Robertson external force, and also building a test electromagnetic field and a test gravitational field in Nariai spacetime geometry</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Spinoptics in the Kerr Spacetime: Polarized Wave Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study propagation of high-frequency electromagnetic and gravitational waves in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole. Due to the interaction of the spin of the field with the spacetime curvature, the standard geometric optics approximation that is used for obtaining the approximate high-frequency solutions of the wave equation should be modified. The corresponding modified spinoptics equations show that the worldline of the spinning massless particle is still null, but no longer a geodesic. We demonstrate that using the hidden symmetries of the Kerr metric one can obtain the corresponding spinoptics equations in the leading order of a $1/{\omega}$ expansion in an explicit form. We focus on the case of the spinning massless fields scattering in the region near the equatorial plane. We demonstrate that the asymptotic planes of the corresponding null ray's motion are slightly tilted. We study this effect and its dependence on the spin of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg Gravity: Geometry, Energy Conditions, and Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate traversable wormholes within the framework of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) nonlinear electrodynamics. By employing the Einstein field equations with quantum corrections from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, we derive wormhole solutions and examine their geometric, physical, and gravitational properties. Two redshift function models are analyzed: one with a constant redshift function and another with a radial-dependent function $\Phi=r_{0}/r$. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum corrections significantly influences the wormhole geometry, particularly by mitigating the need for exotic matter. The shape function and energy density are derived and examined in both models, revealing that the energy conditions, including the weak and null energy conditions (WEC and NEC), are generally violated at the wormhole throat. However, satisfaction of the strong energy condition (SEC) is observed, consistent with the nature of traversable wormholes. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass of the EEH wormhole is calculated, showing contributions from geometric, electromagnetic, and quantum corrections. The mass decreases with the Euler-Heisenberg correction parameter, indicating that quantum effects contribute significantly to the wormhole mass. Furthermore, we investigate gravitational lensing within the EEH wormhole geometry using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, revealing that the deflection angle is influenced by both the electric charge and the nonlinear parameter. The nonlinear electrodynamic corrections enhance the gravitational lensing effect, particularly at smaller impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Geometric Invariants in the Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Setting: Energy and Linear Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of geometric invariants, as defined by Michel \cite{Michel}, in the context of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets. Our focus lies on the charges of energy and linear momentum, and we study their behavior under the Einstein evolution equations. We construct foliations describing the evolution of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets using hyperboloidal time function. We define E-P chargeability as a property of the initial data set, and we show that it is preserved under the evolution for our choice of time function. This ensures that the charges are well-defined along the evolution, which is crucial for our approach. Along such foliations, we recover the same energy-loss and linear momentum-loss formulae as those derived by Bondi, Sachs, and Metzner \cite{Bondi-vanderBurg-Metzner} while operating under weaker asymptotic assumptions. Our approach is distinct from previous work as we do not utilize conformal compactifications and work directly at the level of the initial data set.</description>

      <title>From modified Tsallis-Renyi entropy to a MOND-like force law, Bekenstein bound, and Landauer principle for black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine black hole thermodynamics within the framework of modified Renyi entropy and explore its implications in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), an extension of Newton second law proposed to explain galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter. We conjecture that Tsallis entropy provides an exact description of Bekenstein Hawking entropy, from which the modified Renyi entropy is derived. Using this formulation, we show that a MOND like force law emerges naturally from entropic considerations. We also analyze the Bekenstein bound conjecture, which imposes an upper limit on the entropy of confined quantum systems, and verify its validity under the Renyi modified framework for typical values of the deformation parameter. Furthermore, by invoking the Landauer principle, we obtain an expression for the mass loss due to black hole evaporation. These results suggest that modified Renyi statistics, originating from Tsallis entropy, provides a coherent and promising approach to gravitational dynamics and information theoretic aspects of black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of cosmic curvature on structure formation through general relativistic first-order perturbation theory. We analyze continuity and Euler equations, incorporating cosmic curvature into Einstein equations. Emphasizing late-time dynamics, we investigate matter density contrast evolution in the presence of cosmic curvature, with a specific focus on sub-hubble scales. Solving the evolution equation, we conduct data analysis using cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) (including $r_d$ constraint from CMB), type Ia supernova observations from Pantheon+ sample, logarithmic growth rate $f$ data and $f\sigma_8$ data. While constraints on some parameters remain consistent, inclusion of cosmic curvature losens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 8,0}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0$CDM models. The non-phantom behavior of dark energy proves more favorable in $w_0$CDM model, whereas in CPL model, there is certain evidence for non-phantom behaviour at lower redshift and phantom behaviour at higher redshift. Interestingly, we find certain evidence for non-zero cosmic curvature in $\Lambda$CDM model, but no evidence for it in both $w_0$CDM and CPL models, which indirectly proves the non-degeneracy between dynamical dark energy and cosmic curvature.</description>

Abstract: A random matrix model definition of a family of ${\cal N}{=}1$ supersymmetric extensions of the Virasoro minimal string of Collier, Eberhardt, M\"{u}hlmann, and Rodriguez is presented. An analysis of the defining string equations shows that the models all naturally have unambiguous non-perturbative completions, which are explicitly supplied by the double-scaled orthogonal polynomial techniques employed. Perturbatively, the multi-loop correlation functions of the model define a special supersymmetric class of ``quantum volumes'', generalizing the prototype case, some of which are computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic black holes, analogs of gravitational black holes created in fluid systems, have recently been embedded within Schwarzschild spacetime using the Gross-Pitaevskii theory, leading to configurations with both event and acoustic horizons. This study examines the motion of vortices, modeled as unit-mass relativistic test particles, around a slow-rotating curved acoustic black hole. We analyse the stability of circular orbits, identifying the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and investigate the chaotic dynamics of vortices perturbed from unstable circular orbits near the acoustic horizon. Using the Lyapunov exponent to quantify this chaos, we assess whether it satisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound $(\lambda \le 2 \pi T_H)$, a limit established for gravitational black holes in general relativity. Our results show that, in non-extremal cases $(\xi &gt; 4)$, the Lyapunov exponent respects the bound near the horizon, while in extremal cases $(\xi = 4)$, it is violated due to vanishing surface gravity.

      <title>Litmus tests of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and model-independent measurement of $H_0r_\mathrm{d}$ with LSST and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this analysis we apply a model-independent framework to test the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using simulated SNIa data from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and combined with simulated Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) five-years Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion history from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates a comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy. The analysis is conducted under four different mock true cosmologies: Two curvatures ($\Omega_{k,0}=0$ and 0.1) and two models of dark energy: a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the phenomenologically emergent dark energy. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain cosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\Omega_{k,0}$) and $c/(H_0 r_\mathrm{d})$, with spread due to the SNIa uncertainties up to $\pm 4\%$ and $\pm 0.1$ respectively, without assuming any form of dark energy.</description>

      <title>A Universal Quantum Computer From Relativistic Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a relativistic quantum computing architecture using a variational quantum circuit approach that is shown to allow for universal quantum computing. The variational quantum circuit consists of tunable single-qubit rotations and entangling gates that are implemented successively. The single qubit rotations are parameterized by the proper time intervals of the qubits' trajectories and can be tuned by varying their relativistic motion in spacetime. The entangling layer is mediated by a relativistic quantum field instead of through direct coupling between the qubits. Within this setting, we give a prescription for how to use quantum field-mediated entanglement and manipulation of the relativistic motion of qubits to obtain a universal gate set, for which compact non-perturbative expressions that are valid for general spacetimes are also obtained. We also derive a lower bound on the channel fidelity that shows the existence of parameter regimes in which all entangling operations are effectively unitary, despite the noise generated from the presence of a mediating quantum field. Finally, we consider an explicit implementation of the quantum Fourier transform with relativistic qubits.</description>

      <title>Foliated Asymptotically Safe Gravity: Lorentzian Signature Fluctuations from the Wick Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety constitutes a promising mechanism for a consistent and predictive high-energy completion of the gravitational interactions. To date, most results on the interacting renormalization group fixed point underlying the construction are obtained for Euclidean signature spacetimes. In this work, we use the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) decomposition of the metric degrees of freedom and investigate the relations between the Euclidean and Lorentzian renormalization group flows resulting from the analytic continuation of the lapse function. We discuss the general conditions which guarantee the equivalence of the beta functions. These insights are illustrated based on the flow of the graviton two-point function within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, demonstrating agreement of the Euclidean and Lorentzian settings. Hence the UV- and IR-completions identified in the Euclidean case are robust when changing spacetime signature. We take this as an important indicator that the Euclidean asymptotic safety mechanism carries over to Lorentzian signature spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Observational and Theoretical Constraints on First-Order Phase Transitions in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$ being used as independent loss components (here $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $g' = J^T g J$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a QCD axion.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Black Holes Merging in AGN Disks for Hubble Constant Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational wave observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly-explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. The validity of various universal relations for cold neutron stars involving $f$-mode characteristics and macroscopic properties of the star is confirmed for those isentropic protoneutron stars. Prospects of observations are also discussed. According to simulation results, we then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed.</description>
