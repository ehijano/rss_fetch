      <title>Experimental study on the wall-pressure fluctuations of flow over an axisymmetric hull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall pressure fluctuations beneath the turbulent boundary layer of high-speed underwater vehicles are crucial for hydro-acoustics and acoustic stealth. However, a comprehensive understanding remains limited due to a lack of high-quality experimental data, particularly under realistic operational conditions. To address this gap, this study establishes the first high-fidelity experimental database of wall-pressure fluctuations on an axisymmetric hull at high Reynolds numbers. The dataset's primary innovation is its systematic inclusion of complex maneuvering (yaw and pitch) conditions, providing a benchmark for validating flow noise prediction models. Analysis of this dataset yields key physical insights. The study quantifies systematic Reynolds number effects, including a spectral energy shift toward lower frequencies, and spectral scaling laws by revealing the critical influence of pressure-gradient effects. These findings provide fundamental insights into non-equilibrium 3D turbulent flows and establish an essential dataset to support the design of quieter and more effective underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Turbulence Models and Boundary Conditions for Hybrid Ventilation in Reduced-scale Classroom Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ventilation airflow in a model classroom, where exhaust fans throw out the used air, to replace it with outdoor air through open door. Hybrid ventilation, or mechanically assisted natural ventilation, of this kind is used as a retrofit design to reduce infection risk from airborne transmission. The air stream entering the door forms a jet-like flow, driven by the suction effect of exhaust fans. We compute the jet velocity using Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) method and compare with velocity field measured using particle image velocimetry. Different turbulence models are found to match experimental data near the door, but they over-predict the peak jet velocity further downstream. There is minimal variation between the results obtained using different turbulence models. The computational results are found to be sensitive to inlet boundary conditions, whether the door entry is specified as a pressure inlet or velocity inlet. The geometry of the space outside the door also has a significant effect on the jet velocity. Changing the boundary condition takes the computational results closer to the experimental data; the velocity profiles computed with the extended domain being the closest to the measured peak velocity. Interestingly, the centerline velocity decay computed with the extended domain aligns well with the experimental data. The other cases, irrespective of turbulence model, show much lower decay rate that seem to align with wall jet scaling. This suggests that geometry and boundary conditions at the door is critical to predict the airflow in hybrid ventilation.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Design Considerations for Biconic Supersonic Air Intakes Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional design principles for determining the optimal intake ramp or cone angles, for ensuring no flow spillage at the intake cowl under design conditions, and for the form of the terminal shock in the intake duct are revisited. We show that it is preferable to select the ramp or cone angles to be somewhat smaller than that suggested by the Oswatitsch criterion. An offset cowl lip that slightly violates the shock-on-lip condition is found to be beneficial; in fact, an offset cowl can be arranged for conical intakes with no flow spillage at the cowl lip at all. Improvements to the total pressure recovery are seen when the terminal normal shock is replaced by a strong form of the oblique shock for two-dimensional ramp-type intakes, and with a Lambda shock in case of conical intakes. The necessary design modifications are simple and virtually cost-free. These results rewrite the ground rules for the aerodynamic design of supersonic intakes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Flow Field Reconstruction Using SVGP Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing time-resolved flow fields from temporally sparse velocimetry measurements is critical for characterizing many complex thermal-fluid systems. We introduce a machine learning framework for uncertainty-aware flow reconstruction using sparse variational Gaussian processes in the Kolmogorov-Arnold network topology (SVGP-KAN). This approach extends the classical foundations of Linear Stochastic Estimation (LSE) and Spectral Analysis Modal Methods (SAMM) while enabling principled epistemic uncertainty quantification. We perform a systematic comparison of our framework with the classical reconstruction methods as well as Kalman filtering. Using synthetic data from pulsed impingement jet flows, we assess performance across fractional PIV sampling rates ranging from 0.5% to 10%. Evaluation metrics include reconstruction error, generalization gap, structure preservation, and uncertainty calibration. Our SVGP-KAN methods achieve reconstruction accuracy comparable to established methods, while also providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that reliably indicate when and where predictions degrade. The results demonstrate a robust, data-driven framework for flow field reconstruction with meaningful uncertainty quantification and offer practical guidance for experimental design in periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Electrode Geometry Optimization in Vortex-Type Seawater Magnetohydrodynamic Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generators present a promising pathway for clean energy conversion by directly transforming conductive fluids' kinetic energy into electricity. This study investigates the impact of electrode geometry modifications on the performance of a vortex-type seawater MHD generator. Three electrode designs, partial, whole-area, and spiral, are analyzed through combined analytical and numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The study focuses on internal resistance reduction, current density distribution, and overall power output. The results indicate that electrode area and spacing are critical determinants of performance. The whole-area electrode achieves the highest output, with a 155 percent increase in power compared to the baseline partial electrode. The spiral electrode demonstrates reduced internal resistance and improved current flow but exhibits lower open-circuit voltage due to reduced electrode spacing. The simulations show strong agreement with theoretical models, with deviations of less than 4 percent in open-circuit voltage predictions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization for advancing seawater-based MHD generators as sustainable and efficient energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>A front-tracking study of retinal detachment treatment by magnetic drop targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Ferrofluid Drop Targeting (FDT) for the treatment of the Retinal Detachment (RD), considering, for the first time, the real 3D geometry of an eye and magnets configurations as well as the viscoelastic rheology of the medium, i.e., the Vitreous Humor (VH). A Front-Tracking Method (FTM) is extended to handle a general 3D unstructured Eulerian grid and strong wall effects. The challenges include the accuracy and robustness of the solver when the drop spreads on the retina under the effect of a magnetic field, which necessitates the design of a multi-region Eulerian grid and defining a threshold distance between the front and wall, along with the choice of an effective front smoothing and volume correction FTM sub-algorithms near the walls. After model validations, the effect of different design parameters on important objectives, such as the travel time, settling time, retinal coverage area, and impact compressive stress, are studied. The results reveal that, in addition to the magnetic Bond number, the ratio of the drop-to-VH magnetic permeabilities plays a key role in the terminal shape parameters, like the retinal coverage. Additionally, simultaneously increasing these two parameters, significantly increase the total FDT force, coverage area, and stress concentration, while decreasing the drop-VH surface tension can mitigate the stress concentration on the retina.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurement of surface topography and subsurface velocity field in free-surface turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel combination of two well-established techniques: particle image velocimetry (PIV) and fringe projection profilometry (FPP). Despite seemingly conflicting requirements -- PIV requires a transparent fluid, while FPP requires an opaque surface to project onto -- both requirements are met by adding fluorescein disodium salt, a fluorescent dye, to the water. This dye strongly absorbs the blue light projected onto the surface for FPP while interacting weakly with the green laser light used for PIV, achieving simultaneous opacity and transparency depending on colour. However, this approach presents several challenges, which we are able to solve with a combination of optical filters on the projector and cameras. A series of validation experiments were performed to assess the accuracy of surface elevation measurements at various dye concentrations. The technique was then demonstrated for the case of a vortex street generated by a cylinder interacting with surface waves. Our results show that a dye concentration of 12\,mg/L, although insufficient to make the water opaque to the projected light, yields a mean absolute error in surface elevation of only 20 micrometres.</description>

      <title>On the Reynolds-number scaling of Poisson solver complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to answer the following question: is the complexity of numerically solving the Poisson equation increasing or decreasing for very large simulations of incompressible flows? Physical and numerical arguments are combined to derive power-law scalings at very high Reynolds numbers. A theoretical convergence analysis for both Jacobi and multigrid solvers defines a two-dimensional phase space divided into two regions depending on whether the number of solver iterations tends to decrease or increase with the Reynolds number. Numerical results indicate that, for Navier-Stokes turbulence, the complexity decreases with increasing Reynolds number, whereas for the one-dimensional Burgers equation it follows the opposite trend. The proposed theoretical framework thus provides a unified perspective on how solver convergence scales with the Reynolds number and offers valuable guidance for the development of next-generation preconditioning and multigrid strategies for extreme-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>A rational length scale for large-eddy simulation of turbulence on anisotropic grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the prohibitive cost of resolving all relevant scales, direct numerical simulations of turbulence remain unfeasible for most real-world applications. Consequently, dynamically simplified formulations are needed for coarse-grained simulations. In this regard, eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) are widely used both in academia and industry. These models require a subgrid characteristic length, typically linked to the local grid size. While this length scale corresponds to the mesh step for isotropic grids, its definition for unstructured or anisotropic Cartesian meshes, such as the pancake-like meshes commonly used to capture near-wall turbulence or shear layers, remains an open question. Despite its significant influence on LES model performance, no consensus has been reached on its proper formulation. In this work, we introduce a novel subgrid characteristic length. This length scale is derived from the analysis of the entanglement between the numerical discretization and the filtering in LES. Its mathematical properties and simplicity make it a robust choice for reducing the impact of mesh anisotropies on simulation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed subgrid length is demonstrated through simulations of decaying isotropic turbulence and a turbulent channel flow using different codes.</description>

      <title>On the vortex ring formation and mixing in thin films upon droplet impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a droplet impacts a liquid film, a vortex ring form and govern momentum and species transport. We experimentally investigate vortex ring formation, propagation and instability during droplet impact onto liquid films, with particular emphasis on vortex ring-wall interactions. Particle image velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence are used to study the effects of Reynolds number Re, Weber number We and dimensionless film thickness \delta over ranges Re \leq 3900, We \leq 61 and 0.09 \leq \delta \leq 1.35. As film thickness decreases, a transition from a single axisymmetric vortex ring to azimuthally unstable, multi-vortex structures is observed. A regime map in Re-\delta space is constructed, showing that vortex ring instabilities occur at lower Re for thinner films, while no instabilities are detected for thick films up to the highest Re studied. The azimuthal wave number increases with Re and decreases with \delta. Thinner films exhibit faster decay of primary vortex ring circulation due to wall interactions, accompanied by the formation of secondary vortex ring at lower Re. An empirical model is proposed to predict the temporal evolution of total vortex ring circulation, accounting for both generation and decay.</description>

      <title>An efficient eigenvalue bounding method: CFL condition revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct and large-eddy simulations of turbulence are often solved using explicit temporal schemes. However, this imposes very small time-steps because the eigenvalues of the (linearized) dynamical system, re-scaled by the time-step, must lie inside the stability region. In practice, fast and accurate estimations of the spectral radii of both the discrete convective and diffusive terms are therefore needed. This is virtually always done using the so-called CFL condition. On the other hand, the large heterogeneity and complexity of modern supercomputing systems are nowadays hindering the efficient cross-platform portability of CFD codes. In this regard, our leitmotiv reads: relying on a minimal set of (algebraic) kernels is crucial for code portability and maintenance! In this context, this work focuses on the computation of eigenbounds for the above-mentioned convective and diffusive matrices which are needed to determine the time-step \`a la CFL. To do so, a new inexpensive method, that does not require to re-construct these time-dependent matrices, is proposed and tested. It just relies on a sparse-matrix vector product where only vectors change on time. Hence, both implementation in existing codes and cross-platform portability are straightforward. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are demonstrated for different test cases on both structured Cartesian and unstructured meshes. Finally, the method is combined with a self-adaptive temporal scheme, leading to significantly larger time-steps compared with other more conventional CFL-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Validating the Boltzmann approach to the Large-Eddy simulations of forced homogeneous incompressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of turbulent flows remains a central challenge, as even our most powerful computers cannot resolve the finest scales of motion in many flows of practical interest. As a result, the effects of unresolved scales on large eddies must be modelled via closures and coarse-graining procedures. Large-eddy simulation (LES) traditionally coarse-grains Navier-Stokes equations using Smagorinsky's effective viscosity model. This has the merit of simplicity but fails to account for strong non-equilibrium effects, as they typically arise in most flows in the vicinity of solid walls, the reason being that the notion of eddy viscosity assumes scale separation between small and large eddies, an assumption that fails for high-Reynolds flows far from equilibrium. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) offers an alternative by coarse-graining at the kinetic level, potentially capturing non-equilibrium effects beyond reach of hydrodynamic closures. This paper addresses whether LBM-Smagorinsky LES of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (FHIT) exhibits kinetic behavior. We test whether the turbulent Knudsen number $K_t$, measuring scale separation, reaches order one (kinetic regime) or remains asymptotically small (hydrodynamic regime). Using reference DNS ($800^3$) and iso-Reynolds LES ($100^3$) at $Re = 2 \times 10^4$, we quantify $K_t$ via spatial maps, temporal statistics, energy spectra, and higher-order moments. Results show $K_t \sim O(10^{-3})$, strictly positive without negative excursions, with spectra and flatness following canonical LES behavior. We conclude that despite its kinetic formulation, LBM-Smagorinsky LES operates in the hydrodynamic regime, with small FHIT eddies remaining in local equilibrium with larger ones, validating Smagorinsky viscosity and confirming that LBM-LES functions as conventional hydrodynamic LES while preserving LBM efficiency and locality.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicomponent vesicles suspended in viscoelastic fluids are crucial for understanding a variety of physiological processes. In this work, we develop a continuum surface force (CSF) phase-field model to investigate the hydrodynamics of inextensible multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid flows with inertial forces. Our model couples a fluid field comprising both Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, a surface concentration field representing the multicomponent distribution on the vesicle membrane, and a phase-field variable governing the membrane evolution. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the full Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid field. The surface concentration field is determined by Cahn-Hilliard equations, while the membrane evolution is governed by a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. The membrane is coupled to the surrounding fluid through the continuum surface force (CSF) framework. To ensure stable numerical solutions of the highly nonlinear multi-field model, we employ a residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method for the Navier-Stokes equations, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the Oldroyd-B equations, and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The system of PDEs is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized-$\alpha$ time integration method. To enhance spatial accuracy, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present a series of two-dimensional numerical examples in shear and Poiseuille flows to elucidate the influence of membrane composition and fluid viscoelasticity on the hydrodynamics of multicomponent vesicles.</description>

      <title>Elliptical liquid jets in a supersonic cross-flow: Influence of J on atomization mechanism and unsteadiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous study [Medipati \textit{et al}., (2025) \textit{J. Fluid Mech}. \textbf{1014}, A34] \cite{medipati2025elliptic}, a detailed experimental investigation is performed on the elliptical liquid jets in a supersonic cross-flow ($M_{\infty}$ = 2.5), focusing on the effect of orifice aspect ratio ($AR$ = spanwise dimension/streamwise dimension) on the atomization mechanism for a fixed momentum flux ratio ($J$). In this paper, we present experimental studies that show the influence of $J$ on the jet breakup mechanism, shock structures, and unsteady interactions for each $AR$. A wide range of $J$ values (1.5 to 9.7) and three $AR$ cases (0.3, 1, and 3.3) are chosen for the study. We find that in the case of lower $J$, the jet exhibits large unsteadiness, with larger wavelength Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) waves on the windward surface. In contrast, as the $J$ increases, the unsteadiness decreases, smaller and more regular RT wavelength is formed due to the enhanced drag resulting from the reduced jet deflection. However, irrespective of $J$, in the case of $AR$ = 0.3 and 1, the primary atomization mechanism is due to the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on the lateral surfaces. Furthermore, in the case of lower $J$, the shock waves formed upstream of the jet are highly corrugated with significant variations in time. The intense interaction of the liquid jet with the oncoming boundary layer streaks, in the case of lower $J$, is the primary source of large-scale unsteadiness. These findings highlight the significance of $J$ on the atomization mechanism in supersonic cross-flow.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional modelling of serrated trailing-edge noise based on the Wiener-Hopf technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a semi-analytical model based on the Wiener-Hopf technique is developed to predict the turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise from serrated edges, aiming to account for the correct three-dimensional noise source and propagation effects. The scattered surface pressure over a semi-infinite flat plate is first obtained using the Green's function developed for the acoustic scattering by a serrated edge. A radiation integral over the flat plate of a finite size is subsequently performed to obtain the far-field noise using Amiet's approach, capturing the correct three-dimensional source and propagation effects. The model is subsequently validated by comparing it against the two-dimensional Wiener-Hopf-based model under various serration sizes and frequencies. Far-field spectral predictions show close agreement between the three- and two-dimensional models at moderate observer distances around $r/c=1$, where $r$ and $c$ represent the observer distance and the chord length, respectively. However, unlike the two-dimensional model, the present model successfully captures the far-field $1/r$ decay in noise amplitudes. In addition, the predicted directivity agrees well with the two-dimensional model at most observer angles, but also captures the correct dipolar behaviour at upstream angles and additional high-frequency lobes due to interference patterns induced by the finite flat plate. Compared to the previous three-dimensional serrated models, the present model is based on the Wiener-Hopf technique and achieves a speed-up ratio of two orders of magnitude. It is hoped that such a model may be used to enable an efficient numerical optimisation of the serration shape in realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Compressibility Effects on Leading-Edge Dynamic Stall Criteria at High Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the applicability of two leading-edge dynamic stall criteria, namely, the maximum magnitudes of the leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) and the boundary enstrophy flux (BEF), in a moderately compressible flow regime. While previously shown to predict stall onset ahead of dynamic stall vortex (DSV) formation in incompressible and mildly compressible regimes, these criteria are assessed here at a Reynolds number of $1 \times 10^6$ and freestream Mach numbers between 0.3 and 0.5. Unsteady RANS simulations indicate that DSV formation occurs in close temporal proximity to the attainment of the stall criteria. However, at the highest Mach number considered, stronger shock interaction effects with the shear layer leads to DSV formation prior to the criteria being reached, reducing their predictive accuracy. These findings suggest that while the criteria remain effective at lower Mach numbers, their definitions require modification in compressible regimes where strong shock interactions significantly influence the stall process.</description>

      <title>SPUMA: a minimally invasive approach to the GPU porting of OPENFOAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High Performance Computing (HPC) on hybrid clusters represents a significant opportunity for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), especially when modern accelerators are utilized effectively. However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI. Notably, efficiency is no lower than 90% when switching to the NVIDIA AmgX linear algebra solver. Our tests also reveal that one A100 GPU on Leonardo is equivalent 200-300 Intel Sapphire Rapids cores, provided the GPUs are sufficiently oversubscribed (more than 10 million of cells per GPU). Finally, energy consumption is reduced by up to 82% compared to analogous simulations executed on CPUs.</description>

      <title>Modeling Noise in Quantum Computing of Scalar Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds potential for accelerating the simulation of fluid dynamics. However, hardware noise in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era significantly distorts simulation accuracy. Although error magnitudes are frequently quantified, the specific physical effects of quantum noise on flow simulation results remain largely uncharacterized. We investigate the influence of gate noise on the quantum simulation of one-dimensional scalar convection. By employing a quantum spectral algorithm where ideal time advancement affects only Fourier phases, we isolate and analyze noise-induced artifacts in spectral magnitudes. We derive a theoretical transition matrix based on Hamming distances between computational basis states to predict spectral decay, and then validate this model against density-matrix simulations and experiments on a superconducting quantum processor. Furthermore, using data-driven sparse regression, we demonstrate that quantum noise manifests in the effective partial differential equation primarily as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms. These findings suggest that quantum errors can be modeled as deterministic physical terms rather than purely stochastic perturbations.</description>

      <title>An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description>

      <title>Sparse data assimilation for under-resolved large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work.
  The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data. Working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, a stationary corrective force in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. After data assimilation, corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses are inferred from the stationary corrective force. Ultimately, this corrective force that acts on the mean velocity is replaced by a term that scales the velocity fluctuations through nudging of the corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses.
  Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature.
  Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i.e., Strouhal number), and anisotropic Reynolds stresses. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Momentum and Heat Intercoupling in Reattaching Turbulent Boundary Layers Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition method is deployed to investigate the heat transfer mechanism in a compressible turbulent shear layer and shockwave. To this end, highly resolved Large Eddy Simulations are performed to explore the effect of wall thermal conditions on the behavior of a reattaching free shear layer interacting with an oblique shock in compressible turbulent flows. Various different wall temperature conditions, such as cold adiabatic and hot wall, are considered. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to isolate and study the structures generated by the shear layer exposed in the boundary layer. Results reveal that the shear layer flapping is the most energetic mode. The hot wall gains the highest amplitude for the flapping frequency, and the vortical motions are most intense in the vicinity of the reattachment point of the heated wall. The vortex shedding due to the large-scale motion of the shear layer is associated with the second energetic mode. The cold wall not only has a higher amplitude of the shedding mode, but it also has a lower frequency compared to the adiabatic and hot walls. This work sheds light on the underlying physics of the nonlinear intercoupling of momentum and heat, hence providing guidelines for designing control systems for high speed flight vehicles and mitigating aircraft fatigue loading caused by intense wall pressure fluctuations and heat flux.</description>

      <title>Plane-layer Rayleigh-B\'enard convection up to $Ra=10^{11}$: Near-wall fluctuations and role of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection through direct numerical simulations in a three-dimensional plane layer of aspect ratio 4 for Rayleigh numbers $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^{11}$ and Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$. We summarize the height-dependent statistics of velocity and temperature fluctuations and corresponding scalings with the Rayleigh number. We include an analysis on the role of coherent and incoherent flow regions near the wall for global heat transfer. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of turbulent transport on a finite-amplitude sinusoidal shear flow added at time $t=0$, which either freely decays in a long transient or remains existent when a steady sinusoidal volume forcing is added. In the latter case, weak logarithmic near-wall layers are formed, however, with von K\'arm\'an and offset constants that differ from standard values. The typical magnitude of both coefficients, and thus a full turbulent boundary layer of velocity and temperature, is re-established only for a switch from sinusoidal to constant pressure gradient driving of the flow. In all cases, except for the constant pressure gradient-driven flow, no enhancement of global turbulent heat and momentum transfer within error bars is detected, even though the sinusoidal amplitude is of the order of the characteristic free-fall velocity.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional gravity-capillary standing waves: computation, resonance and instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of three-dimensional gravity-capillary standing waves by using cubic and quintic truncated Hamiltonian formulations and the Craig-Sulem expansion of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator (DNO). The resulting models are treated as triply periodic boundary-value problems and solved via a spatio-temporal collocation method without executing initial-value calculations. This approach avoids the numerical stiffness associated with surface tension and numerical instabilities arising from time integration. We reduce the number of unknowns significantly by exploiting the spatio-temporal symmetries for three types of symmetric standing waves. Comparisons with existing asymptotic and numerical results illustrate excellent agreement between the models and the full potential-flow formulation. We investigate typical bifurcations and standing waves that feature square, hexagonal, and more complex flower-like patterns under the three-wave resonance. These solutions are generalisations of the classical Wilton ripples. Temporal simulations of the computed three-dimensional standing waves exhibit perfect periodicity and reveal an instability mechanism based on the reported oblique instability in two-dimensional standing waves.</description>

      <title>Simulations of inertial liquid-lens coalescence with the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coalescence of liquid lenses is relevant in various applications, including inkjet printing and fog harvesting. However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\theta &lt; 40^{\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like oscillatory statistics can also arise from a purely local dynamical mechanism, revealed using a minimal Lorenz model description of a walking droplet viewed as an active particle with internal degrees of freedom. A localized defect directly perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This work opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs by revealing how quantum-like statistics can emerge from local internal-state dynamics of active particles.</description>
