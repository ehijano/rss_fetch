      <title>Task Allocation in Customer-led Two-sided Markets with Satellite Constellation Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly applied to complex task allocation in two-sided markets, where agents such as companies and customers interact dynamically. Traditional company-led Stackelberg game models, where companies set service prices, and customers respond, struggle to accommodate diverse and personalised customer demands in emerging markets like crowdsourcing. This paper proposes a customer-led Stackelberg game model for cost-efficient task allocation, where customers initiate tasks as leaders, and companies create their strategies as followers to meet these demands. We prove the existence of Nash Equilibrium for the follower game and Stackelberg Equilibrium for the leader game while discussing their uniqueness under specific conditions, ensuring cost-efficient task allocation and improved market performance. Using the satellite constellation services market as a real-world case, experimental results show a 23% reduction in customer payments and a 6.7-fold increase in company revenues, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in emerging markets.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for EFX Orientations of Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding EFX orientations of graphs of chores, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, each edge corresponds to a chore, and a chore has zero marginal utility to an agent if its corresponding edge is not incident to the vertex corresponding to the agent. Recently, Zhou~et~al.~(IJCAI,~2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores admit EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores admit EFX orientations is NP-complete. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture by exhibiting a polynomial-time algorithm that finds an EFX orientation of a graph containing only chores if one exists, even if the graph contains self-loops. Remarkably, our first result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods admit EFX orientations of goods was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al.~(EC,~2023). In addition, we show the analogous decision problem for multigraphs to be NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Learning in Conjectural Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of Conjectural Variations games to Stackelberg games involving multiple leaders and a single follower. To solve these nonconvex games, a common assumption is that the leaders compute their strategies having perfect knowledge of the follower's best response. However, in practice, the leaders may have little to no knowledge about the other players' reactions. To deal with this lack of knowledge, we assume that each leader can form conjectures about the other players' best responses, and update its strategy relying on these conjectures. Our contributions are twofold: (i) On the theoretical side, we introduce the concept of Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium -- keeping our formalism conjecture agnostic -- with Stackelberg Equilibrium being a refinement of it. (ii) On the algorithmic side, we introduce a two-stage algorithm with guarantees of convergence, which allows the leaders to first learn conjectures on a training data set, and then update their strategies. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Markovian Search with Socially Aware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of sequential search problems for selecting multiple candidates from different societal groups under "ex-ante constraints" aimed at producing socially desirable outcomes, such as demographic parity, diversity quotas, or subsidies for disadvantaged groups. Starting with the canonical Pandora's box model [Weitzman, 1978] under a single affine constraint on selection and inspection probabilities, we show that the optimal constrained policy retains an index-based structure similar to the unconstrained case, but may randomize between two dual-based adjustments that are both easy to compute and economically interpretable. We then extend our results to handle multiple affine constraints by reducing the problem to a variant of the exact Carath\'eodory problem and providing a novel polynomial-time algorithm to generate an optimal randomized dual-adjusted index-based policy that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. Building on these insights, we consider richer search processes (e.g., search with rejection and multistage search) modeled by joint Markov scheduling (JMS) [Dumitriu et al., 2003; Gittins, 1979]. By imposing general affine and convex ex-ante constraints, we develop a primal-dual algorithm that randomizes over a polynomial number of dual-based adjustments to the unconstrained JMS Gittins indices, yielding a near-feasible, near-optimal policy. Our approach relies on the key observation that a suitable relaxation of the Lagrange dual function for these constrained problems admits index-based policies akin to those in the unconstrained setting. Using a numerical study, we investigate the implications of imposing various constraints, in particular the utilitarian loss (price of fairness), and whether these constraints induce their intended societally desirable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid in Non-Stationary Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark, which represents the sum of the best possible rewards at each time step, offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the bidding sequence, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret when either of these metrics is sub-linear in the time horizon.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in Repeated Games under No-Regret with Dynamic Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In repeated games, strategies are often evaluated by their ability to guarantee the performance of the single best action that is selected in hindsight, a property referred to as \emph{Hannan consistency}, or \emph{no-regret}. However, the effectiveness of the single best action as a yardstick to evaluate strategies is limited, as any static action may perform poorly in common dynamic settings. Our work therefore turns to a more ambitious notion of \emph{dynamic benchmark consistency}, which guarantees the performance of the best \emph{dynamic} sequence of actions, selected in hindsight subject to a constraint on the allowable number of action changes. Our main result establishes that for any joint empirical distribution of play that may arise when all players deploy no-regret strategies, there exist dynamic benchmark consistent strategies such that if all players deploy these strategies the same empirical distribution emerges when the horizon is large enough. This result demonstrates that although dynamic benchmark consistent strategies have a different algorithmic structure and provide significantly enhanced individual assurances, they lead to the same equilibrium set as no-regret strategies. Moreover, the proof of our main result uncovers the capacity of independent algorithms with strong individual guarantees to foster a strong form of coordination.</description>

      <title>How Can Incentives and Cut Layer Selection Influence Data Contribution in Split Federated Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To alleviate the training burden in federated learning while enhancing convergence speed, Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising approach by combining the advantages of federated and split learning. However, recent studies have largely overlooked competitive situations. In this framework, the SFL model owner can choose the cut layer to balance the training load between the server and clients, ensuring the necessary level of privacy for the clients. Additionally, the SFL model owner sets incentives to encourage client participation in the SFL process. The optimization strategies employed by the SFL model owner influence clients' decisions regarding the amount of data they contribute, taking into account the shared incentives over clients and anticipated energy consumption during SFL. To address this framework, we model the problem using a hierarchical decision-making approach, formulated as a single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium among clients and analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium by examining the leader's game. Furthermore, we discuss privacy concerns related to differential privacy and the criteria for selecting the minimum required cut layer. Our findings show that the Stackelberg equilibrium solution maximizes the utility for both the clients and the SFL model owner.</description>
