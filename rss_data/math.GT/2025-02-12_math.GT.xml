      <title>Knots and non-orientable surfaces in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new approach for describing and understanding knots and links in a 3-manifold through the use of an embedded non-orientable surface. Specifically, we define a plat-like representation based on this non-orientable surface. The method applies to manifolds of the form $M=\mathcal H\cup_{\varphi} \mathcal C(U)$ where $\mathcal H$ is a handlebody, $\mathcal C(U)$ is the mapping cylinder of the orientating two sheeted covering of a non-orientable closed surface $U$ and $\varphi:\partial \mathcal H\to \partial \mathcal C(U)$ is an attaching homeomorphism. We prove that all lens spaces $L(2k,q)$ and the trivial circle bundles over orientable closed surfaces, $\Sigma\times S^1$, belong to this family of manifolds and that there exist manifolds of this type that are neither lens spaces or trivial circle bundles. Furthermore, we show that any link in such manifolds can be represented as a plat-like closure of a braid in the surface braid group of $\partial \mathcal H$.</description>

      <title>Actualizing subgroups of 3-manifold groups in homologically small submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a simple $3$-manifold, and let $A$ be a finitely generated, freely indecomposable subgroup of $\pi_1(Y)$. Set $\eta=\dim H_1(A;{\bf F}_2)$. Suppose that either (a) $\partial Y\ne\emptyset$ or (b) $\dim H_1(Y;{\bf F}_2)\ge3\eta^2-4\eta+4$.
  Under these hypotheses, we show that $A$ is carried by some compact, connected three-dimensional submanifold $Z$ of $\text{int} \;Y$ such that (1) $\partial Z$ is non-empty, and each of its components is incompressible in $Y$; (2) the Euler characteristic of $Z$ is bounded below by $1-\eta$; and (3) $\dim H_1(Z;{\bf F}_2)\le 3\eta^2-4\eta+1$.
  The conclusion implies that any boundary component of $Z$ is an incompressible surface of genus at most $\eta$. In Case (b), this should be compared with earlier results proved by Agol-Culler-Shalen and Culler-Shalen, which provide a surface of genus at most $\eta$ under weaker hypotheses (the lower bound on $\dim H_1(Y; {\bf F}_2)$ being linear in $\eta$ rather than quadratic), but do not give any relationship between the given subgroup $A$ and this surface.
  In a forthcoming paper we will apply the result to give a new upper bound for the ratio of the rank of the mod 2 homology of a closed, orientable hyperbolic $3$-manifold to the volume of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Geography of irreducible 4-manifolds with order two fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a closed, oriented topological 4-manifold whose Euler characteristic and signature are denoted by $e$ and $\sigma$. We show that if $R$ has order two $\pi_1$, odd intersection form, and $2e + 3\sigma \geq 0$, then for all but seven $(e, \sigma)$ coordinates, $R$ admits an irreducible smooth structure. We accomplish this by performing a variety of operations on irreducible simply-connected 4-manifolds to build 4-manifolds with order two $\pi_1$. These techniques include torus surgeries, symplectic fiber sums, rational blow-downs, and numerous constructions of Lefschetz fibrations, including a new approach to equivariant fiber summing.</description>

      <title>A Sm\"org\aa sbord of (bi)contact structures, Reeb flows and pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note was written for the proceedings of the conference "Symplectic Geometry and Anosov Flows" held in Heideleberg in July 2024. It is meant as an invitation to the study of certain families of contact structures, centering around the following question: ``How much can one relate the dynamics of two distinct Reeb flows of the same contact structure?'' We gather some results as well as state many more questions and conjectures around that theme.</description>

      <title>The quasi-isometry invariance of the Coset Intersection Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ consisting of a group and finite collection of subgroups, we introduce a simplicial $G$-complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ called the coset intersection complex. We prove that the quasi-isometry type and the homotopy type of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ are quasi-isometric invariants of the group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. Classical properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ correspond to topological or geometric properties of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$, such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. For a certain class of right-angled Artin groups and their maximal parabolic subgroups, we show that the complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ is quasi-isometric to the Extension graph; in particular, it is quasi-isometric to a tree.</description>

      <title>What makes math problems hard for reinforcement learning: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple perspectives, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the context defined by the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic enhancements and a topological hardness measure with implications for a broad class of search problems. As part of our study, we also address several open mathematical questions. Notably, we demonstrate the length reducibility of all but two presentations in the Akbulut-Kirby series (1981), and resolve various potential counterexamples in the Miller-Schupp series (1991), including three infinite subfamilies.</description>
