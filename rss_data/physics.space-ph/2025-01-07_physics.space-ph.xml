      <title>A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Effect in Earth's Dayside Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field strength, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence and with matching temporal characteristics. During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Differentiating the acceleration mechanisms in the slow and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second, and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface, before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate and it cools far more slowly than a freely-expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfv\'en wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast-slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfv\'enicity that suggest Alfv\'en waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfv\'enic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds Alfv\'enic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfv\'enic slow wind can be driven by its non-adiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below Parker's orbit.</description>

      <title>Analyses of features of magnetic cycles at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is about two times critical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun and stars is usually possible when the dynamo number (D) is above a critical value Dc. As the star ages, its rotation rate and thus D decrease. Hence, the question is how far the solar dynamo is from the critical dynamo transition. To answer this question, we have performed a set of simulations using Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models at different values of dynamo supercriticality and analyzed various features of magnetic cycle. By comparing the recovery rates of the dynamo from the Maunder minimum and statistics (numbers and durations) of the grand minima and maxima with that of observations and we show that the solar dynamo is only about two times critical and thus not highly supercritical. The observed correlation between the polar field proxy and the following cycle amplitudes and Gnevyshev-Ohl rule are also compatible with this conclusion.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Chapman's Hydrostatic Solar Wind Mechanism in Parker's Hydrodynamic Solar Wind Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy (Clauser, Parker) for the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the wind channel area, which is described precisely by Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models for the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Challenges in identifying the coronal hole wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar wind is frequently categorized based on its respective solar source region. Two well-established categorizations of the coronal hole wind, the scheme based on the charge-state composition, and the scheme based on proton plasma, identify a very different fraction of solar wind in the data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum at the end of solar cycle 24. We investigate possible explanations for the different identifications of the coronal wind in 2009 in the scheme based on the charge-state composition (almost only coronal hole wind) and in the scheme based on the proton plasma (almost no coronal hole wind at the same time). We compared the properties of the respective coronal hole wind types and their changes with solar activity cycle in 2001- 2010. As a comparison reference, we included the coronal hole wind as identified by an unsupervised machine-learning approach, k-means, in our analysis. We find that the scheme based on charge-state composition likely misidentifies some slow solar wind as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum. The k-means classification we considered includes two types of coronal hole wind, the first of which is dominant during the solar activity maximum, whereas the second is dominant during the solar activity minimum. A low fraction of coronal hole wind from low-latitude coronal holes observed by ACE in 2009 is plausible because during this time period, a very small number of low-latitude coronal holes was observed. The results imply that the origin-oriented solar wind classification needs to be revisited, and they also suggest that an explicit inclusion of the phase of the solar activity cycle can be expected to improve the classification of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Shock and SEP Modeling Study for the 5 September 2022 SEP Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On September 5, 2022, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\sim$1~MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.</description>

      <title>Solar variability in the Mg II h and k lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability of Mg II h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg II index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, Mg II index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg II index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover the climate relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg II index and its variability based on the well-established SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg II index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize Mg II index timeseries on climate relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the timeseries of the Mg II index spanning nearly three centuries.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>
