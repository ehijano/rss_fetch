      <title>AI-Driven Digital Transformation and Firm Performance in Chinese Industrial Enterprises: Mediating Role of Green Digital Innovation and Moderating Effects of Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between AI-driven digital transformation and firm performance in Chinese industrial enterprises, with particular attention to the mediating role of green digital innovation and the moderating effects of human-AI collaboration. Using panel data from 6,300 firm-year observations collected from CNRDS and CSMAR databases between 2015 and 2022, we employ multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Our findings reveal that AI-driven digital transformation significantly enhances firm performance, with green digital innovation mediating this relationship. Furthermore, human-AI collaboration positively moderates both the direct relationship between digital transformation and firm performance and the mediating pathway through green digital innovation. The results provide valuable insights for management practice and policy formulation in the context of China's evolving industrial landscape and digital economy initiatives. This research contributes to the literature by integrating perspectives from technology management, environmental sustainability, and organizational theory to understand the complex interplay between technological adoption and business outcomes.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Credibly Transform the Creation of Panel Data from Diverse Historical Tables?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs offer a watershed change for the digitization of historical tables, enabling low-cost processing centered on domain expertise rather than technical skills. We rigorously validate an LLM-based pipeline on a new panel of historical county-level vehicle registrations. This pipeline is 100 times less expensive than outsourcing, reduces critical parsing errors from 40% to 0.3%, and matches human-validated gold standard data with an $R^2$ of 98.6%. Analyses of growth and persistence in vehicle adoption are statistically indistinguishable whether using LLM or gold standard data. LLM-based digitization unlocks complex historical tables, enabling new economic analyses and broader researcher participation.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the AI Economy: A Mathematical Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The economy in the modern world is greatly influenced by artificial intelligence (AI). This paper aims to determine the impact of AI quantitative relationships on the country's economic parameters, including GDP per Capita. Historical data analysis is used in the research. A new mathematical algorithm for the magnitude of a technological level and AI factors vector has been developed. The study calculated the economic effect of AI on GDP per Capita. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that there is a positive Pearson correlation between growth. On AI and GDP per Capita, that is, to increase GDP per Capita by 1%, an average increase of 23.9% in AI is required.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>

      <title>On long-duration storage, weather uncertainty and limited foresight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is a key component for fully renewable, sector-coupled energy systems based on wind and solar. While capacity expansion planning has begun to take into account interannual weather variability, it often ignores weather uncertainty and limited foresight in capacity and operational decisions. We build a stochastic capacity expansion model for fully decarbonized energy systems with LDES in Europe accounting for weather uncertainty - isolating the effect of limited foresight by comparing it to a perfect foresight benchmark. Under limited foresight, LDES acts as a hedge against extreme system states operating defensively and exhibiting a stockpiling effect absent under perfect foresight. Solar PV gains in system value for its higher predictability with up to 29\% higher capacities versus the benchmark while onshore wind capacities are lower. We shed light on the underlying mechanisms by deriving implicit LDES bidding curves. We show that LDES bids reflect the costs and the weather-dependent probability of extreme system states conditional on the current system state. This has important implications for the price formation on renewable electricity markets, as a wide and continuous range of probabilistic LDES bids alleviates concerns of extreme price disparity at high renewable shares.</description>

      <title>How circular is the linear economy? Analysing circularity, resource flows and their relation to GDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Circular Economy (CE) has evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from a simple model of resource circulation to an increasingly complex and debated framework. While its primary objective remains the elimination of waste and pollution through regenerative processes, CE has encountered definitional ambiguities and criticisms. This study critically examines the prevailing circularity metrics, such as the circular material use rate or circularity and argues that such narrow definitions obscure the true potential of CE by excluding higher-value strategies like maintenance, repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing. Through a mixed-methods analysis of global resource flows (e.g.,104 Gt input in 2020, with only 9% recycled), the study demonstrates how adjusting circularity calculations for non-recoverable materials reveals a real circularity rate of 27%, far exceeding the apparent 9%. Yet even this higher rate translates to a mere 1.4% of global GDP, underscoring the limited economic impact of recycling-centric approaches. The study identifies that 69% of economic value already derives from managing existing stocks, suggesting mainstream CE discourse has largely overlooked the most substantial circular practices already embedded in modern economies. The study thus proposes a radical change in the assessment framework that, (a) replaces annual input-based metrics with economic value creation as the primary indicator, (b) incorporates stock utilization efficiency as a core circularity measure and (c) establishes new policy targets focused on value retention and reuse rather than mere material recovery. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in circular economy strategy -- from counting recycled materials to optimizing economic resilience through intelligent stock management and service-based value creation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy Consumption in Stochastic Production Systems: Using a Simulation-Based Approach for Stopping Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing, this study introduces a Simulation-Based Approach (SBA) to model a stopping policy for energy-intensive stochastic production systems, developed and tested in a real-world industrial context. The case company - an energy-intensive lead-acid battery manufacturer - faces significant process uncertainty in its heat-treatment operations, making static planning inefficient. To evaluate a potential sensor-based solution, the SBA leverages simulated sensor data (using a Markovian model) to iteratively refine Bayesian energy estimates and dynamically adjust batch-specific processing times. A full-factorial numerical simulation, mirroring the company's 2024 heat-treatment process, evaluates the SBA's energy reduction potential, configuration robustness, and sensitivity to process uncertainty and sensor distortion. Results are benchmarked against three planning scenarios: (1) Optimized Planned Processing Times (OPT); (2) the company's Current Baseline Practice; and (3) an Ideal Scenario with perfectly known energy requirements. SBA significantly outperforms OPT across all tested environments and in some cases even performs statistically equivalent to an Ideal Scenario. Compared to the Current Baseline Practice, energy input is reduced by 14-25%, depending on uncertainty and sensor accuracy. A Pareto analysis further highlights SBA's ability to balance energy and inspection-labour costs, offering actionable insights for industrial decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Managerial Insights on Investment Strategy in Cybersecurity: Findings from Multi-Country Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the strategic role of cybersecurity based on survey data from 1,083 managers across Europe, the UK, and the United States. The findings indicate growing recognition of cybersecurity as a source of competitive advantage, although firms continue to face barriers such as limited resources, talent shortages, and cultural resistance. Larger and high-tech firms tend to adopt more proactive strategies, while SMEs and low-tech sectors display greater variability. Key managerial tensions emerge in balancing security with innovation and agility. Notable country-level differences are observed across Europe, the UK, and the United States. Across all contexts, leadership and employee engagement appear central to closing the gap between strategic intent and operational practice.</description>

      <title>Post-COVID Inflation &amp; the Monetary Policy Dilemma: An Agent-Based Scenario Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The economic shocks that followed the COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light the difficulty, both for academics and policy makers, of describing and predicting the dynamics of inflation. This paper offers an alternative modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are four-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring, rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii) however, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of our study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an easy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates causal inference for policies affecting group-level outcomes derived from microdata models. We formalize these outcomes using population moment conditions and show that standard one-step GMM estimators are generally inconsistent due to an endogenous weighting problem: policy-induced changes in the microdata distribution alter implicit GMM weights. In contrast, two-stage Minimum Distance (MD) estimators perform well when group sizes are sufficiently large, a statement we formalize. While MD estimators can become inconsistent in very small groups due to a policy-induced sample selection problem, we demonstrate this can be addressed by incorporating auxiliary population information.</description>

      <title>Why do we need to complement the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard with an artificial intelligence tool for what-if policy analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard (EURIS) is currently and broadly used for the definition of regional innovation policies by European policymakers; it is a regional innovation measuring tool for the analysis of each specific innovation indicator, from which it is possible to analyze the overtime evolution of each regional innovation indicator; according to the importance of the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard for innovation policy purposes, we state that European regional policymakers need integrative and synergistic methodological tools, with respect to the EURIS one, for innovation policy purposes. We state the need to integrate the current methodology of the European Regional Innovation Scoreboard with a Factorial K-means (FKM) tool for grouping purposes, and with a neural network (NN) tool for performing what-if policy analyses. Experimental results suggested that our proposed grouping/labeling methodologies are able to develop more cohesive groups, resulting in regions having better similarities, than the ones developed by the EURIS methodology. Experimental simulations, within the framework of our proposed what-if tool, highlight the potential usefulness of our methodological tool (neural network-based) for the understanding of the potential effectiveness of each possible and specific regional innovation policy to be implemented. We claim that our proposed FKM-NN tool could be used, by regional innovation policymakers, as a very effective synergistic instrument of the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines monthly matching efficiency in the Japanese marriage market using novel data from IBJ, the country's largest structured matching platform. Unlike administrative or dating app data, IBJ provides full search, dating, and matching logs based on verified profiles and confirmed engagements. Users are highly selected into serious marriage search via costly screening. Covering 3.3% of national marriages annually, the data offer rare behavioral granularity. Using a nonparametric approach, I estimate time-varying matching functions and elasticities. Efficiency rises threefold over time, illustrating how digital intermediation transforms partner search in modern marriage markets.</description>

      <title>Information Flow in the FTX Bankruptcy: A Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the cryptocurrency network of the FTX exchange during the collapse of its native token, FTT, to understand how network structures adapt to significant financial disruptions, by exploiting vertex centrality measures. Using proprietary data on the transactional relationships between various cryptocurrencies, we construct the filtered correlation matrix to identify the most significant relations in the FTX and Binance markets. By using suitable centrality measures - closeness and information centrality - we assess network stability during FTX's bankruptcy. The findings document the appropriateness of such vertex centralities in understanding the resilience and vulnerabilities of financial networks. By tracking the changes in centrality values before and during the FTX crisis, this study provides useful insights into the structural dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Results reveal how different cryptocurrencies experienced shifts in their network roles due to the crisis. Moreover, our findings highlight the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets and how the failure of a single entity can lead to widespread repercussions that destabilize other nodes of the network.</description>

Abstract: Accurate economic simulations often require many experimental runs, particularly when combined with reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, training reinforcement learning agents in multi-agent economic environments can be slow. This paper introduces EconoJax, a fast simulated economy, based on the AI economist. EconoJax, and its training pipeline, are completely written in JAX. This allows EconoJax to scale to large population sizes and perform large experiments, while keeping training times within minutes. Through experiments with populations of 100 agents, we show how real-world economic behavior emerges through training within 15 minutes, in contrast to previous work that required several days. We additionally perform experiments in varying sized action spaces to test if some multi-agent methods produce more diverse behavior compared to others. Here, our findings indicate no notable differences in produced behavior with different methods as is sometimes suggested in earlier works. To aid further research, we open-source EconoJax on Github.</description>
