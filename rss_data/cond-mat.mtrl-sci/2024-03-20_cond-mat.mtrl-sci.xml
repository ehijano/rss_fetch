      <title>Knowledge-Reuse Transfer Learning Methods in Molecular and Material Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules and materials are the foundation for the development of modern advanced industries such as energy storage systems and semiconductor devices. However, traditional trial-and-error methods or theoretical calculations are highly resource-intensive, and extremely long R&amp;D (Research and Development) periods cannot meet the urgent need for molecules/materials in industrial development. Machine learning (ML) methods based on big data are expected to break this dilemma. However, the difficulty in constructing large-scale datasets of new molecules/materials due to the high cost of data acquisition and annotation limits the development of machine learning. The application of transfer learning lowers the data requirements for model training, which makes transfer learning stand out in researches addressing data quality issues. In this review, we summarize recent advances in transfer learning related to molecular and materials science. We focus on the application of transfer learning methods for the discovery of advanced molecules/materials, particularly, the construction of transfer learning frameworks for different systems, and how transfer learning can enhance the performance of models. In addition, the challenges of transfer learning are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast pseudomagnetic fields from electron-nuclear quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. When converted to effective magnetic fields, values on the order of tens of Teslas are easily reached.</description>

      <title>Predicted Complex Lithium Phases at Terapascal Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) phase diagram of elemental lithium (Li) up to multiterapascal (TPa) pressures using ab-initio random structure search (AIRSS) and density functional theory (DFT). At zero temperature, beyond the high-pressure $Fd\bar{3}m$ diamond structure predicted in previous studies, we find eleven solid-state phase transitions to structures of greatly varying complexity, in addition to two structures that we calculate will become stable with sufficient temperature. The full $p$-$T$ dependence of the phase boundaries are computed within the vibrational harmonic approximation, and the solid-liquid melting line is calculated using ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, between 39.1 TPa and 55.7 TPa, Li adopts an elaborate monoclinic structure with 46 atoms in the primitive unit cell, and between 71.9 TPa and $103$ TPa, an incommensurate host-guest phase of the Ba-IV type. We find that Li, hitherto predicted to be an electride at TPa pressures, abruptly loses its electride character above 16 TPa, reverting back to normal metallic behaviour with a corresponding rise in the Fermi-level electronic density of states (eDOS) and broadening of the electronic bands.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric coupling at the domain level in polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of a magnetic field on the ferroelectric domain pattern in polycrystalline hexagonal ErMnO3 at cryogenic temperatures. Utilizing piezoelectric force microscopy measurements at 1.65 K, we observe modifications of the topologically protected ferroelectric domain structure induced by the magnetic field. These alterations likely result from strain induced by the magnetic field, facilitated by intergranular coupling in polycrystalline multiferroics. Our findings give insights into the interplay between electric and magnetic properties at the local scale and represent a so far unexplored pathway for manipulating topologically protected ferroelectric vortex patterns in hexagonal manganites.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Predicting Energetics of Interacting Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting defect systems are ubiquitous in materials under realistic scenarios, yet gaining an atomic-level understanding of these systems from a computational perspective is challenging - it often demands substantial resources due to the necessity of employing supercell calculations. While machine learning techniques have shown potential in accelerating materials simulations, their application to systems involving interacting defects remains relatively rare. In this work, we present a comparative study of three different methods to predict the free energy change of systems with interacting defects. We leveraging a limited dataset from Density Functional Theory(DFT) calculations to assess the performance models using materials descriptors, graph neural networks and cluster expansion. Our findings indicate that the cluster expansion model can achieve precise energetics predictions even with this limited dataset. Furthermore, with synthetic data generate from cluster expansion model at near-DFT levels, we obtained enlarged dataset to assess the demands on data for training accurate prediction models using graph neural networks for systems featuring interacting defects. A brief discussion of the computational cost for each method is provided at the end. This research provide a preliminary evaluation of applying machine learning techniques in imperfect surface systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous formation of Frenkel defects in high-entropy-alloys-type compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are attracting attention due to their exceptional properties, such as enhanced mechanical toughness, superconducting robustness, and thermoelectric performance. Numerous HEAs have been developed for diverse applications, ranging from self-healing in fusion reactors to addressing environmental concerns with thermoelectric materials. Understanding atomic diffusion within HEA crystals is crucial for these applications. Here, this study investigates diffusion mechanisms in PbTe-based HEAs, focusing on the role of indium (In). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that In inclusion prompts spontaneous Frenkel defect formation, notably enhancing diffusion not only of In$^+$ but also other cations. Frenkel defect formation, closely linked to alloy properties, is predominantly influenced by charge rather than cation size. This insight not only enhances comprehension of HEA diffusion mechanisms but also develops HEAs with properties such as self-healing from damage and high ion permeability, advancing the field of material science.</description>

      <title>The influence of hydrogen on the electronic structure in transition metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of hydrogen on the electronic structure of a binary transition metallic glass of V$_{80}$Zr$_{20}$. We examine the hybridization between the hydrogen and metal atoms with the aid of hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Combined with ab initio density functional theory, we are able to show and predict the formation of $s$-$d$ hybridized energy states. With optical transmission and resistivity measurements, we investigate the emergent electronic properties formed out of those altered energy states, and together with the theoretical calculations of the frequency-dependent conductivity tensor, we qualitatively support the observed strong wavelength-dependency of the hydrogen-induced changes on the optical absorption and a positive parabolic change in resistivity with hydrogen concentration.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-volatile anomalous Nernst effect in altermagnet with collinear N\'eel vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), a widely investigated transverse thermoelectric effect that converts waste heat into electrical energy with remarkable flexibility and integration capability, has been extended to antiferromagnets with non-collinear spin texture recently. ANE in compensated magnet with collinear N\'eel vector will bring more opportunities to construct magnetic-field-immune and ultrafast transverse thermoelectric converters, but remains unachieved for long. It is due to the degenerated band structure of traditional collinear compensated magnet excludes non-zero Berry curvature. Here, we realize non-volatile ANE in altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film with collinear Neel vector, whose unique alternating spin-splitting band structure plays vital role in creating non-zero Berry curvature and hotpots of anomalous Nernst conductivity near band intersections. Interestingly, ANE is relatively weak in stoichiometric Mn5Si3, but undergoes a sixfold enhancement through strategically raising the Fermi level by additional Mn doping, indicating sensitive intrinsic influence from specific location of the Fermi level on ANE in altermagnet. Moreover, our investigation reveals a unique Neel-vector-dependent temperature-scaling relationship of anomalous Nernst conductivity in Mn5Si3. Our work not only fills a longstanding gap by confirming the presence of non-volatile ANE in collinear compensated magnet, but also enlightens thermoelectric physics related to exotic spin-splitting band structure in altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Influence of chemical composition on the room temperature plas-ticity of C15 Ca-Al-Mg Laves phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of chemical composition changes on the room temperature mechanical proper-ties in the C15 CaAl2 Laves phase were investigated in two off-stoichiometric compositions with 5.7 at.-% Mg addition (Ca33Al61Mg6) and 10.8 at.-% Mg and 3.0 at.-% Ca addition (Ca36Al53Mg11) and compared to the stoichiometric (Ca33Al67) composition. Cubic Ca-Al-Mg Laves phases with multiple crystallographic orientations were characterised and deformed using nanoindentation. The hardness and indentation modulus were measured to be 4.1 +- 0.3 GPa and 71.3 +- 1.5 GPa for Ca36Al53Mg11, 4.6 +- 0.2 GPa and 80.4 +- 3.8 GPa for Ca33Al61Mg6 and 4.9 +- 0.3 GPa and 85.5 +- 4.0 GPa for Ca33Al67, respectively. The resulting surface traces as well as slip and crack planes, were distinguished on the indentation surfac-es, revealing the activation of several different {11n} slip systems, as further confirmed by conventional transmission electron microscopic observations. Additionally, the deformation mechanisms and corresponding energy barriers of activated slip systems were evaluated by atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Strain aided drastic reduction in lattice thermal conductivity and improved thermoelectric properties in Janus MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface and strain engineering are among the cheaper ways to modulate structure property relations in materials. Due to their compositional flexibilities, MXenes, the family of two-dimensional materials, provide enough opportunity for surface engineering. In this work, we have explored the possibility of improving thermoelectric efficiency of MXenes through these routes. The Janus MXenes obtained by modifications of the transition metal constituents and the functional groups passivating their surfaces are considered as surface engineered materials on which bi-axial strain is applied in a systematic way. We find that in the three Janus compounds Zr$_{2}$COS, ZrHfO$_{2}$ and ZrHfCOS, tensile strain modifies the electronic and lattice thermoelectric parameters such that the thermoelectric efficiency can be maximised. A remarkable reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity due to increased anharmonicity and elevation in Seebeck coefficient are obtained by application of moderate tensile strain. With the help of first-principles electronic structure method and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory we analyse the interplay of structural parameters, electronic and dynamical properties to understand the effects of strain and surface modifications on thermoelectric properties of these systems. Our detailed calculations and in depth analysis lead not only to the microscopic understanding of the influences of surface and strain engineering in these three systems, but also provide enough insights for adopting this approach and improve thermoelectric efficiencies in similar systems.</description>

      <title>Employing semi-supervised learning for high-resolution segmentation of crystal defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials characterization using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) requires indexing the orientation of the measured region from Kikuchi patterns. In the presence of defects the quality of the Kikuchi patterns can degrade. Or if the measured region contains a grain boundary, two or more orientations can cause pattern overlap which may lead to erroneous orientation calculations. In this work we show that constrained non-negative matrix factorization can be successfully employed to characterize such measurements containing signals from multiple crystallographic orientations, particularly if the misorientation is very small &lt; 1 deg. Using simulated patterns, we demonstrate the resolution limit of the method and subsequently showcase a computationally efficient segmentation of a dendritic microstructure, which is on par with high resolution EBSD. By analysis of the weight metrics of the components across a grain boundary or dendrites, we demonstrate how very small misorientations/low-angle grain boundaries can be resolved at a pixel level. Our approach constitutes a versatile and robust tool complementing other fast indexing methods for microstructure characterization.</description>

      <title>Bridging deep learning force fields and electronic structures with a physics-informed approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a physics-informed neural network approach bridging deep-learning force field and electronic structure simulations, illustrated through twisted two-dimensional large-scale material systems. The deep potential molecular dynamics model is adopted as the backbone, and electronic structure simulation is integrated. Using Wannier functions as the basis, we categorize Wannier Hamiltonian elements based on physical principles to incorporate diverse information from a deep-learning force field model. This information-sharing mechanism streamlines the architecture of our multifunctional model, enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Utilizing Wannier functions as the basis lays the groundwork for predicting more physical quantities. This approach serves as a powerful tool to explore both the structural and electronic properties of large-scale systems characterized by low periodicities. By endowing an existing well-developed machine-learning force field with electronic structure simulation capabilities, the study marks a significant advancement in developing multimodal machine-learning-based computational methods that can achieve multiple functionalities traditionally exclusive to first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Optical Signatures of Polymeric Carbon Nitrides: Insights into Stacking-Induced Excitonic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and significant potential in energy-related applications. Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) with 2D stacked architecture show promise as photocatalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion and as versatile 2D semiconductors. However, the lack of a clear definition of the exact structural model of these materials limits our fundamental understanding of their unique properties. Here, we investigate the structure-induced optical properties of PCNs through \textit{ab initio} calculations. Our study on the electronic and optical properties of PCNs highlights the significant influence of structure on their behavior, especially near band edges. The analysis reveals that the degree of condensation and corrugation influences the electron/hole localization and the energy levels of $\pi$ electrons, which are crucial for the optical behavior. In addition, the microstructures of 2D configurations lead to divergent optical properties in 3D configurations, with characteristic peaks identified at 350 nm and interlayer interactions at 400--500 nm, depending on the specific microstructures. Through observations over 2D and 3D structures, we elucidate exciton photophysical processes in PCN materials. This highlights the substantial differences in optical properties between actual 2D and 3D structures, while also demonstrating the potential for carrier and energy transport mechanisms to occur perpendicular to the plane. Finally, our results provide deep insights into the understanding of previously hidden microstructural, electronic, and optical properties of PCNs, paving the way for further performance and property enhancements in this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Towards a redundancy-based theory of structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advocate for a theory of materials structure based on the general notion of redundancy rather than its special case of symmetry. The recoverability of particle positions from interparticle distances is given as an argument for why distances rather than positions constitute the fundamental quantity underlying structure. The rapidly decreasing nature of interaction strength with interparticle distance is used to argue for the representability of a system through the neighbourhoods of its constituent particles. The extracopularity coefficient $E$ is presented as a local quantifier of redundancy and compared to point group order $|G|$, a local quantifier of symmetry. A fundamental limitation of $|G|$ is demonstrated. Some perspective is given on how $E$ can be used to arrive at a global redundancy-based description of a system.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Ionic Vortices: Voltage-Reconfigurable Swirling-Spin Analog-Memory Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in information technologies has spurred the need for innovative memory concepts, for which advanced data-processing methods and tailor-made materials are required. Here we introduce a previously unexplored nanoscale magnetic object: an analog magnetic vortex controlled by electric-field-induced ion motion, termed magneto-ionic vortex or "vortion". This state arises from paramagnetic FeCoN through voltage gating and gradual N3-ion extraction within patterned nanodots. Unlike traditional vortex states, vortions offer comprehensive analog adjustment of key properties such as magnetization amplitude, nucleation/annihilation fields, or coercivity using voltage as an energy-efficient tuning knob. This manipulation occurs post-synthesis, obviating the need for energy-demanding methods like laser pulses or spin-torque currents. By leveraging an overlooked aspect of N3-magneto-ionics -- planar ion migration within nanodots -- precise control of the magnetic layer's thickness is achieved, which enables reversible transitions among paramagnetic, single-domain, and vortion states, offering future prospects for analog computing, multi-state data storage, or brain-inspired devices.</description>

      <title>Exotic magnetism in perovskite KOsO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new perovskite KOsO3 has been stabilized under high-pressure and high temperature conditions. It is cubic at 500 K (Pm-3m) and undergoes subsequent phase transitions to tetragonal at 320 K (P4/mmm) and rhombohedral (R-3m) at 230 K as shown from refining synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRD) data. The larger orbital overlap integral and the extended wavefunction of 5d electrons in the perovskite KOsO3 allow to explore physics from the regime where Mott and Hund's rule couplings dominate to the state where the multiple interactions are on equal footing. We demonstrate an exotic magnetic ordering phase found by neutron powder diffraction along with physical properties via a suite of measurements including magnetic and transport properties, differential scanning calorimetry, and specific heat, which provide comprehensive information for a system at the crossover from localized to itinerant electronic behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ). The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK - CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design in topological valleytronics and twistronics.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole-interaction-induced entanglement between two-dimensional ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of dipole-dipole interaction as a means of entangling two distant ferromagnets. To this end we make use of the Bogoliubov transformation as a symplectic transformation. We show that the coupling of the uniform magnon modes can be expressed using four squeezing parameters which we interpret in terms of hybridization, one-mode and two-mode squeezing. We utilize the expansion in terms of the squeezing parameters to obtain an analytic formula for the entanglement in the magnon ground state using the logarithmic negativity as entanglement measure. Our investigation predicts that for infinitely large two-dimensional ferromagnets, the dipole-dipole interaction does not lead to significant long-range entanglement. However, in the case of finite ferromagnets, finite entanglement can be expected</description>

      <title>Influence of concentration-dependent material properties on the fracture and debonding of electrode particles with core-shell structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particle designs offer a route to improved lithium-ion battery performance. However, they are susceptible to mechanical damage such as fracture and debonding, which can significantly reduce their lifetime. Using a coupled finite element model, we explore the impacts of diffusion-induced stresses on the failure mechanisms of an exemplar system with an NMC811 core and an NMC111 shell. In particular, we systematically compare the implications of assuming constant material properties against using Li concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient and partial molar volume. With constant material properties, our results show that smaller cores with thinner shells avoid debonding and fracture regimes. When factoring in a concentration-dependent partial molar volume, the maximum values of tensile hoop stress in the shell are found to be significantly lower than those predicted with constant properties, reducing the likelihood of fracture. Furthermore, with a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, significant barriers to full electrode utilisation are observed due to reduced lithium mobility at high states of lithiation. This provides a possible explanation for the reduced accessible capacity observed in experiments. Shell thickness is found to be the dominant factor in precluding structural integrity once the concentration dependency is accounted for. These findings shed new light on the performance and effective design of core-shell electrode particles.</description>

      <title>Effects of dislocation filtering layers on optical properties of third telecom window emitting InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dots grown on silicon substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating light emitters based on III-V materials with silicon-based electronics is crucial for further increase in data transfer rates in communication systems since the indirect bandgap of silicon prevents its direct use as a light source. We investigate here InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dot (QD) structures grown directly on 5{\deg} off-cut Si substrate and emitting light at 1.5 micrometers, compatible with established telecom platform. Using different dislocation defects filtering layers, exploiting strained superlattices and supplementary QD layers, we mitigate the effects of lattice constant and thermal expansion mismatches between III-V materials and Si during growth. Complementary optical spectroscopy techniques, i.e. photoreflectance and temperature-, time- and polarization- resolved photoluminescence, allow us to determine the optical quality and application potential of the obtained structures by comparing them to a reference sample -- state-of-the-art QDs grown on InP. Experimental findings are supported by calculations of excitonic states and optical transitions by combining multiband k.p and configuration-interaction methods. We show that our design of structures prevents the generation of a considerable density of defects, as intended. The emission of Si-based structures appears to be much broader than for the reference dots, due to the creation of different QD populations which might be a disadvantage in particular laser applications, however, could be favourable for others, e.g. in broadly tunable devices, sensors, or optical amplifiers. Eventually, we identify the overall most promising combination of defect filtering layers, discuss its advantages and limitations, and prospects for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Effect of annealing on the hot salt corrosion resistance of the fine-grained titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr obtained via cold Rotary Swaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hot salt corrosion (HSC) test was performed on the fine-grained titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr (Russian industrial alloy PT-7M). The ultrafine-grained (UFG) microstructure in the titanium alpha-alloy was formed via cold Rotary Swaging. The grain size and volume fraction of the recrystallized microstructure in the alloy were varied by choosing appropriate annealing temperatures and times. The microstructure and corrosion resistance of UFG alloys were studied after 30 min of annealing at 500-700C and after 1000 h of annealing at 250C. Metallographic studies were carried out to investigate the effects of annealing on the nature and extent of corrosive damage in the titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr. After HSC tests, surface analyses of the titanium alpha-alloy samples were conducted using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. During the HSC testing of the titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr, a competitive interaction between intergranular corrosion (IGC) and pitting corrosion was observed. To the best of our knowledge, it was shown for the first time that annealing affects the relationship among the IGC, pitting corrosion and uniform corrosion rates of the titanium alloy. Prolonged low-temperature annealing at 250C resulted in a more pronounced increase in the uniform corrosion rate than short-term high-temperature annealing for 30 min at 500-700C. An in-depth analysis of the effect of the structure and phase composition of the grain boundaries on the susceptibility of the alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr to HSC was conducted.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transparent Electrodes: Interplay of High Purity SWCNTs network and a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of transparent electrodes led to the development of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, LCDs, touchscreens, IR sensors, etc. Since ITO has many drawbacks in respect of its production cost and limited transparency in IR, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a potential replacement for ITO due to their exceptional electrical and optical properties, especially in the IR region. In this work, we present the development of a CNT-polymer composite thin film that exhibits outstanding transparency across both visible and IR spectra prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. This approach not only ensures uniform integration and crosslinking of CNTs into lightweight matrices, but also represents a cost-effective method for producing transparent electrodes with remarkable optical and electrical properties. The produced films achieved a transparency above 80% in the UV-VIS range and approximately 70% in the mid-IR range. The sheet resistance of the fabricated thin films was measured at about 4 kOhm/sq, showing a tendency to decrease with the number of bilayers. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated electrical properties and transport mechanisms in more detail with computational analysis. Computational analysis was performed to better understand the electrical behavior of nanotube-polymer junctions in the interbundle structure. Based on all results, we propose that the transparent electrodes with 4 and 6 bilayers are the most optimal structures in terms of optical and electrical properties.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Physical Properties of Crystals through Synthetic Temperature Control: A Case Study for new Polymorphic NbFeTe2 phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth parameters play a significant role in the crystal quality and physical properties of layered materials. Here we present a case study on a van der Waals magnetic NbFeTe2 material. Two different types of polymorphic NbFeTe2 phases, synthesized at different temperatures, display significantly different behaviors in crystal symmetry, electronic structure, electrical transport, and magnetism. While the phase synthesized at low temperature showing behavior consistent with previous reports, the new phase synthesized at high temperature, has completely different physical properties, such as metallic resistivity, long-range ferromagnetic order, anomalous Hall effect, negative magnetoresistance, and distinct electronic structures. Neutron diffraction reveals out-of-plane ferromagnetism below 70K, consistent with the electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility studies. Our work suggests that simply tuning synthetic parameters in a controlled manner could be an effective route to alter the physical properties of existing materials potentially unlocking new states of matter, or even discovering new materials.</description>

Abstract: We propose a material design method via gradient-based optimization on compositions, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods: exhaustive database searches and conditional generation models. It optimizes inputs via backpropagation, aligning the model's output closely with the target property and facilitating the discovery of unlisted materials and precise property determination. Our method is also capable of adaptive optimization under new conditions without retraining. Applying to exploring high-Tc superconductors, we identified potential compositions beyond existing databases and discovered new hydrogen superconductors via conditional optimization. This method is versatile and significantly advances material design by enabling efficient, extensive searches and adaptability to new constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre quantum sensors provide unique opportunities in studying condensed matter systems: they are quantitative, noninvasive, physically robust, offer nanoscale resolution, and may be used across a wide range of temperatures. These properties have been exploited in recent years to obtain nanoscale resolution measurements of static magnetic fields arising from spin order and current flow in condensed matter systems. Compared with other nanoscale magnetic-field sensors, NV centres have the unique advantage that they can probe quantities that go beyond average magnetic fields. Leveraging techniques from magnetic resonance, NV centres can perform high precision noise sensing, and have given access to diverse systems, such as fluctuating electrical currents in simple metals and graphene, as well as magnetic dynamics in yttrium iron garnet. In this review we summarise unique opportunities in condensed matter sensing by focusing on the connections between specific NV measurements and previously established physical characteristics that are more readily understood in the condensed matter community, such as correlation functions and order parameters that are inaccessible by other techniques, and we describe the technical frontier enabled by NV centre sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, which have experienced challenges in supply availability and volatility in pricing of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected Na-ion and Li-ion price trends across over 5,400 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. We show that Na-ion struggles to be price advantageous against low-cost lithium-ion variants in the near term and are competitive primarily when the Li-ion supply chain is disrupted. Modeled outcomes suggest maximizing Na-ion energy densities via cost-centric development roadmaps to be the most impactful way to improve competitiveness (over that of market intervention) and highlights the value of enhanced supply chain security.</description>

      <title>Surfactant-Driven Dynamic Changes in Rheology of Activated Carbon Slurry Electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slurry electrodes are an effective means to improve flow battery performance by reducing electrode fouling and increasing the active surface area necessary for electrochemical reactions. It is critical to understand how the slurry formulation impacts its rheological profile and ultimately battery performance. We study the linear and nonlinear rheology of activated carbon (AC) based slurry electrode used in an all-iron flow battery in the presence of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100). Our results show the slurry mimics a colloidal gel with elasticity remaining constant despite increasing surfactant concentration until $\alpha$(=C$_{surf.}$/C$_{AC}$) &lt; 0.65. However, at $\alpha \ge$ 0.65, the slurry abruptly transitions to a fluid with no measurable yield stress. This critical surfactant concentration at which the rheological profile undergoes a dynamic change matches the concentration found previously for gel collapse of this system. Moreover, this transition is accompanied by a complete loss of electrical conductivity. These data show that site specific adsorption of surfactant molecules often used in slurry formulation have a significant and dramatic impact on flow behavior, which should be considered when formulating a slurry electrode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18331v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, liquid metal catalysts have emerged as a compelling choice for the controllable, large-scale, and high-quality synthesis of two-dimensional materials. At present, there is little mechanistic understanding of the intricate catalytic process, though, of its governing factors or what renders it superior to growth at the corresponding solid catalysts. Here, we report on a combined experimental and computational study of the kinetics of graphene growth during chemical vapor deposition on a liquid copper catalyst. By monitoring the growing graphene flakes in real time using in situ radiation-mode optical microscopy, we explore the growth morphology and kinetics over a wide range of CH4-to-H2 pressure ratios and deposition temperatures. Constant growth rates of the flakes' radius indicate a growth mode limited by precursor attachment, whereas methane-flux-dependent flake shapes point to limited precursor availability. Large-scale free energy simulations enabled by an efficient machine-learning moment tensor potential trained to density-functional theory data provide quantitative barriers for key atomic-scale growth processes. The wealth of experimental and theoretical data can be consistently combined into a microkinetic model that reveals mixed growth kinetics that, in contrast to the situation at solid Cu, is partly controlled by precursor attachment alongside precursor availability. Key mechanistic aspects that directly point toward the improved graphene quality are a largely suppressed carbon dimer attachment due to the facile incorporation of this precursor species into the liquid surface and a low-barrier ring-opening process that self-heals 5-membered rings resulting from remaining dimer attachments.</description>

Abstract: We present atomic and electronic structure investigations of Single-layer Sb(110) rhombohedral crystal formed on Au(111) substrate. Low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveal a pure 2D Sb stripe structure, composed by a pair of Sb(110) unit cell located in a chiral configuration with mirror symmetry broken along the x axis direction. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement and Sb-weighted band structure from density functional theory calculations, we report the unambiguous determination of one pair of Rashba-type splitting band from the 2D Sb film, exhibiting a chiral symmetry in the electronic structure with the crossing point located at point and point, respectively. Moreover, From dI/dV spectra and calculated density of states(DOS), the quantum well(QW) Rashba-type states at different energy induced by the in-plane mirror symmetry broken in Sb stripe structure have been identified, and the orbital decomposition of projected band structure indicates hybridization between Sb py state and Au state can modify the spin splitting of QW states due to the intrinsic large SOC of Au state introduced into the QW states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Hall (SH) effect, the conversion of the electric current to the spin current along the transverse direction, relies on the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we develop a microscopic theory on the mechanisms of the SH effect in magnetic metals, where itinerant electrons are coupled with localized magnetic moments via the Hund exchange interaction and the SOC. Both antiferromagnetic metals and ferromagnetic metals are considered. It is shown that the SH conductivity can be significantly enhanced by the spin fluctuation when approaching the magnetic transition temperature of both cases. For antiferromagnetic metals, the pure SH effect appears in the entire temperature range, while for ferromagnetic metals, the pure SH effect is expected to be replaced by the anomalous Hall effect below the transition temperature. We discuss possible experimental realizations and the effect of the quantum criticality when the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is tuned to zero temperature.</description>

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the achievements of natural language processing, we adopt self-supervised learning and utilize an equivariant graph neural network to develop a unified platform designed for training generative models capable of generating crystal structures, as well as efficiently adapting to downstream tasks in material property prediction. To mitigate the challenge of incorporating large-scale assessment on the reliability of generated structures into the training process, we utilize the generative adversarial network (GAN) with its discriminator being a cost-effective evaluator for the generated structures, resulting in notable improvements in model performance. We demonstrate the utility of our model in finding the optimal crystal structure under predefined conditions. Without reliance on properties acquired experimentally or numerically, our model further displays its capability to comprehend the mechanism of crystal structure formation through its ability to grouping chemically similar elements. Therefore, this paper extends an invitation to explore deeper into the scientific understanding of material structures through generative models, offering a fresh perspective on broadening the scope and efficacy of machine learning in material science.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Twist-Averaging Technique for Magnetic Metals: Applications using Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an improved twist-averaging scheme for quantum Monte Carlo methods that use converged Kohn-Sham or Hartree-Fock orbitals as the reference. This twist-averaging technique is tailored to sample the Brillouin zone of magnetic metals, although it naturally extends to nonmagnetic conducting systems. The proposed scheme aims to reproduce the reference magnetization and achieves charge neutrality by construction, thus avoiding the large energy fluctuations and the postprocessing needed to correct the energies. It shows the most robust convergence of total energy and magnetism to the thermodynamic limit when compared to four other twist-averaging schemes. Diffusion Monte Carlo applications are shown on nonmagnetic Al and ferromagnetic $\alpha$-Fe. The cohesive energy of Al in the thermodynamic limit shows an excellent agreement with the experimental result. Furthermore, the magnetic moments in $\alpha$-Fe exhibit rapid convergence with an increasing number of twists.</description>

      <title>Energy-conserving equivariant GNN for elasticity of lattice architected metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on their geometrical design. The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to traditional methods such as finite element modelling. In this work, we generate a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii) consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced training requirements. Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the model to an architected material design task. The methods which we developed are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical tensor etc.</description>

      <title>Lightweight, error-tolerant edge detection using memristor-enabled stochastic logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for efficient edge vision has spurred the interest in developing stochastic computing approaches for performing image processing tasks. Memristors with inherent stochasticity readily introduce probability into the computations and thus enable stochastic image processing computations. Here, we present a stochastic computing approach for edge detection, a fundamental image processing technique, facilitated with memristor-enabled stochastic logics. Specifically, we integrate the memristors with logic circuits and harness the stochasticity from the memristors to realize compact stochastic logics for stochastic number encoding and processing. The stochastic numbers, exhibiting well-regulated probabilities and correlations, can be processed to perform logic operations with statistical probabilities. This can facilitate lightweight stochastic edge detection for edge visual scenarios characterized with high-level noise errors. As a practical demonstration, we implement a hardware stochastic Roberts cross operator using the stochastic logics, and prove its exceptional edge detection performance, remarkably, with 95% less computational cost while withstanding 50% bit-flip errors. The results underscore the great potential of our stochastic edge detection approach in developing lightweight, error-tolerant edge vision hardware and systems for autonomous driving, virtual/augmented reality, medical imaging diagnosis, industrial automation, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Response and Quantum Geometry of Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>
