      <title>Testing the effects of an unobservable factor: Do marriage prospects affect college major choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by studying the effects of marriage prospects on students' college major choices, this paper develops a new econometric test for analyzing the effects of an unobservable factor in a setting where this factor potentially influences both agents' decisions and a binary outcome variable. Our test is built upon a flexible copula-based estimation procedure and leverages the ordered nature of latent utilities of the polychotomous choice model. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate that marriage prospects significantly influence the college major choices of college graduates participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (97) Survey. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of our findings with alternative tests that use stated marriage expectation measures from our data, thereby demonstrating the applicability and validity of our testing procedure in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-free Efficient Pseudo-Likelihood (EPL) Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple procedure to compute Efficient Pseudo Likelihood (EPL) estimator proposed by Dearing and Blevins (2024) for estimating dynamic discrete games, without computing Jacobians of equilibrium constraints. EPL estimator is efficient, convergent, and computationally fast. However, the original algorithm requires deriving and coding the Jacobians, which are cumbersome and prone to coding mistakes especially when considering complicated models. The current study proposes to avoid the computation of Jacobians by combining the ideas of numerical derivatives (for computing Jacobian-vector products) and the Krylov method (for solving linear equations). It shows good computational performance of the proposed method by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>International vulnerability of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20628v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a globalised world, inflation in a given country may be becoming less responsive to domestic economic activity, while being increasingly determined by international conditions. Consequently, understanding the international sources of vulnerability of domestic inflation is turning fundamental for policy makers. In this paper, we propose the construction of Inflation-at-risk and Deflation-at-risk measures of vulnerability obtained using factor-augmented quantile regressions estimated with international factors extracted from a multi-level Dynamic Factor Model with overlapping blocks of inflations corresponding to economies grouped either in a given geographical region or according to their development level. The methodology is implemented to inflation observed monthly from 1999 to 2022 for over 115 countries. We conclude that, in a large number of developed countries, international factors are relevant to explain the right tail of the distribution of inflation, and, consequently, they are more relevant for the vulnerability related to high inflation than for average or low inflation. However, while inflation of developing low-income countries is hardly affected by international conditions, the results for middle-income countries are mixed. Finally, based on a rolling-window out-of-sample forecasting exercise, we show that the predictive power of international factors has increased in the most recent years of high inflation.</description>

      <title>Robust Network Targeting with Multiple Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many policy problems involve designing individualized treatment allocation rules to maximize the equilibrium social welfare of interacting agents. Focusing on large-scale simultaneous decision games with strategic complementarities, we develop a method to estimate an optimal treatment allocation rule that is robust to the presence of multiple equilibria. Our approach remains agnostic about changes in the equilibrium selection mechanism under counterfactual policies, and we provide a closed-form expression for the boundary of the set-identified equilibrium outcomes. To address the incompleteness that arises when an equilibrium selection mechanism is not specified, we use the maximin welfare criterion to select a policy, and implement this policy using a greedy algorithm. We establish a performance guarantee for our method by deriving a welfare regret bound, which accounts for sampling uncertainty and the use of the greedy algorithm. We demonstrate our method with an application to the microfinance dataset of Banerjee et al. (2013).</description>

      <title>A Distributed Lag Approach to the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide estimation and inference for the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM) under the assumption that the dynamic common component can be expressed in terms of a finite number of lags of contemporaneously pervasive factors. The proposed estimator is simply an OLS regression of the observed variables on factors extracted via static principal components and therefore avoids frequency domain techniques entirely.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with Time-varying Continuous Treatments using Double/Debiased Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a difference-in-differences (DiD) method for a time-varying continuous treatment and multiple time periods. Our framework assesses the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) when comparing two non-zero treatment doses. The identification is based on a conditional parallel trend assumption imposed on the mean potential outcome under the lower dose, given observed covariates and past treatment histories. We employ kernel-based ATET estimators for repeated cross-sections and panel data adopting the double/debiased machine learning framework to control for covariates and past treatment histories in a data-adaptive manner. We also demonstrate the asymptotic normality of our estimation approach under specific regularity conditions. In a simulation study, we find a compelling finite sample performance of undersmoothed versions of our estimators in setups with several thousand observations.</description>

      <title>On Spatio-Temporal Stochastic Frontier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature on stochastic frontier models until the early 2000s, the joint consideration of spatial and temporal dimensions was often inadequately addressed, if not completely neglected. However, from an evolutionary economics perspective, the production process of the decision-making units constantly changes over both dimensions: it is not stable over time due to managerial enhancements and/or internal or external shocks, and is influenced by the nearest territorial neighbours. This paper proposes an extension of the Fusco and Vidoli [2013] SEM-like approach, which globally accounts for spatial and temporal effects in the term of inefficiency. In particular, coherently with the stochastic panel frontier literature, two different versions of the model are proposed: the time-invariant and the time-varying spatial stochastic frontier models. In order to evaluate the inferential properties of the proposed estimators, we first run Monte Carlo experiments and we then present the results of an application to a set of commonly referenced data, demonstrating robustness and stability of estimates across all scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects for Difference-in-Differences With Staggered Adoptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the bias of the canonical two-way fixed effects estimator for difference-in-differences under staggered adoptions, Wooldridge (2021) proposed the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, which adds many parameters. However, this reduces efficiency. Restricting some of these parameters to be equal (for example, subsequent treatment effects within a cohort) helps, but ad hoc restrictions may reintroduce bias. We propose a machine learning estimator with a single tuning parameter, fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE), that enables automatic data-driven selection of these restrictions. We prove that under an appropriate sparsity assumption FETWFE identifies the correct restrictions with probability tending to one, which improves efficiency. We also prove the consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality of FETWFE for several classes of heterogeneous marginal treatment effect estimators under either conditional or marginal parallel trends, and we prove the same results for conditional average treatment effects under conditional parallel trends. We demonstrate FETWFE in simulation studies and an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Randomization Tests for Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When conducting causal inference or designing policy, researchers are often concerned with the existence and extent of interference between units, which may be influenced by factors such as distance, proximity, and connection strength. However, complex correlations across units pose significant challenges for inference. This paper introduces partial null randomization tests (PNRTs), a novel framework for testing interference in experimental settings. PNRTs adopt a design-based approach, combining unconditional randomization testing with pairwise comparisons to enable straightforward implementation and ensure finite-sample validity under minimal assumptions about network structure. To illustrate the method's broad applicability, this paper applies it to a large-scale experiment by Blattman et al. (2021) in Bogota, Colombia, which evaluates the impact of hotspot policing on crime using street segments as units of analysis. The findings indicate that increasing police patrolling time in hotspots has a significant displacement effect on violent crime but not on property crime. A simulation study calibrated to this dataset further demonstrates the strong power properties of PNRTs and their suitability for general interference scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Lower Confidence Band for the Optimal Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the question of reporting a lower confidence band (LCB) for optimal welfare in a policy learning problem. A straightforward procedure inverts a one-sided t-test based on an efficient estimator of the optimal welfare. We show that under empirically relevant data-generating processes, this procedure can be dominated by an LCB corresponding to suboptimal welfare, with the average difference of the order N-1/2. We relate the first-order dominance result to a lack of uniformity in the margin assumption, a standard sufficient condition for debiased inference on the optimal welfare ensuring that the first-best policy is well-separated from the suboptimal ones. Finally, we show that inverting the existing tests from the moment inequality literature produces LCBs that are robust to the non-uniqueness of the optimal policy and easy to compute. We find that this approach performs well empirically in the context of the National JTPA study.</description>

      <title>Double Debiased Covariate Shift Adaptation Robust to Density-Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a scenario where we have access to train data with both covariates and outcomes while test data only contains covariates. In this scenario, our primary aim is to predict the missing outcomes of the test data. With this objective in mind, we train parametric regression models under a covariate shift, where covariate distributions are different between the train and test data. For this problem, existing studies have proposed covariate shift adaptation via importance weighting using the density ratio. This approach averages the train data losses, each weighted by an estimated ratio of the covariate densities between the train and test data, to approximate the test-data risk. Although it allows us to obtain a test-data risk minimizer, its performance heavily relies on the accuracy of the density ratio estimation. Moreover, even if the density ratio can be consistently estimated, the estimation errors of the density ratio also yield bias in the estimators of the regression model's parameters of interest. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a doubly robust estimator for covariate shift adaptation via importance weighting, which incorporates an additional estimator for the regression function. Leveraging double machine learning techniques, our estimator reduces the bias arising from the density ratio estimation errors. We demonstrate the asymptotic distribution of the regression parameter estimator. Notably, our estimator remains consistent if either the density ratio estimator or the regression function is consistent, showcasing its robustness against potential errors in density ratio estimation. Finally, we confirm the soundness of our proposed method via simulation studies.</description>
