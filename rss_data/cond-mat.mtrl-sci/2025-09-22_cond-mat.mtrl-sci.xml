      <title>Long-lived dynamics of the charge density wave in TiSe$_2$ observed by neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved elastic neutron scattering combined with rapid laser heating was used to probe the charge density wave (CDW) state in 1T-TiSe$_2$, capturing both the melting and reformation of the CDW on long timescales and providing clues on the roles of phonons and excitons. With the laser source on, superlattice Bragg peaks such as (-1.5, -1.5, 1.5) observed below the CDW transition due to the new lattice periodicity, dissipate within 5 seconds, at a rate that is much slower than the sample's thermal response to the heat wave propagation. Whereas the electronic ordering associated with the CDW phase is disrupted rapidly by the laser-induced heating, the periodic lattice distortion (PLD) exhibits a markedly slower evolution during the melting process. This delayed suppression of the PLD relative to the thermal response indicates that CDW melting proceeds through a nonthermal pathway, likely linked to the loss of superlattice phonons such as the soft mode at q = (0.5 ,0, 0.5 ).</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of higher-order elastic constants from divided differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented to calculate from first principles the higher-order elastic constants of a solid material. The method relies on finite strain deformations, a density functional theory approach to calculate the Cauchy stress tensor, and a recursive numerical differentiation technique homologous to the divided differences polynomial interpolation algorithm. The method is applicable as is to any material, regardless its symmetry, to calculate elastic constants of, in principle, any order. Here, we introduce conceptual framework and technical details of our method, we discuss sources of errors, we assess convergence trends, and we present selected applications. In particular, our method is used to calculate elastic constants up to the 6$^{th}$ order of two crystalline materials with the cubic symmetry, silicon and gold. To demonstrate general applicability, our method is also used to calculate the elastic constants up to the 5$^{th}$ order of $\alpha$-quartz, a crystalline material belonging to the trigonal crystal system, and the second- and third-order elastic constants of kevlar, a material with an anisotropic bonding network. Higher order elastic constants computed with our method are validated against density functional theory calculations by comparing stress responses to large deformations derived within the continuum approximation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Berry Curvature Driven Anomalous Hall and Nernst Effect in Co$_2$MnSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals often exhibit unusual electronic and thermal transport due to nontrivial bulk band crossings, enabling simultaneous realization of large anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities ($\sigma_{xy}$ and $\alpha_{xy}$). Here, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the anomalous transport properties of ferromagnetic Co$_2$MnSn is reported. First-principles calculations reveal topological Weyl points producing significant Berry curvature, driving dominant intrinsic anomalous Hall/Nernst effects. Electronic and thermal transport measurements demonstrate robust anomalous transport with substantial conductivity values that persist at room temperature ($\sigma_{xy}\sim$ 500 S/cm, $\alpha_{xy}\sim$ 1.3 A/m/K). We also show how the chemical substitution (via tuning Fermi level) can boost these effects (up to $\sigma_{xy}\sim$ 1376 S/cm, $\alpha_{xy}\sim$ 1.49 A/m/K at 150 K). These findings position Co$_2$MnSn as a compelling platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and advancing next-generation thermoelectric and spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth, Band Structure, Magnetism and Electrochemical Properties of Hexavalent Strontium Ruthenium Oxyhydroxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenates comprise an interesting class of materials with a wide range of extremely exciting properties, and thus the discovery of new stable ruthenates remains an active area of investigation. We report the crystal growth and comprehensive studies including crystal and electronic structure, magnetic and electrochemical properties of a hexavalent ruthenium oxyhydroxide Sr3Ru2O9H2 prepared through a low-temperature hydrothermal method. Single crystals and powder samples of this phase are isolated by optimising the Sr(OH)2 to KRuO4 ratio while maintaining a high base concentration. The new structure consists of a rare five-coordinated RuVI featuring isolated trigonal prisms and crystallising in a non-centrosymmetric tetragonal system. Isolated Ru polyhedra leading to a large spatial distance ~ 50 pm between the Ru metal centres render the compound paramagnetic despite strong antiferromagnetic correlation. Band structure calculation suggests a metal-like electronic ground state with mostly Ru d and O p orbitals contributing to the Fermi surface. The electrochemical performance of Sr3Ru2O9H2, though not as impressive as RuO2, remains relevant and is on par with other reported OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of cation-dependent polarisation switching dynamics in fluorite ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorite ferroelectrics are exciting candidates for next-generation non-volatile memory devices because their unique ferroelectric mechanism, which arises from unconventional oxygen displacements, permits ferroelectricity with minimal thickness constraints. However, the polarisation switching mechanism remains the subject of intense debate due to a limited understanding of the atomic-scale dynamics which are extremely challenging to detect and measure. Here, we observe directly the polarisation switching pathways by visualising oxygen site dynamics in ZrO2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 freestanding membranes using an advanced atomic-column imaging technique-optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We observe that the 180- and 90-degree polarisation pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, we also reveal how different cation species in fluorite oxides impact the accessible polarisation switching pathways. Our atomic-level insights into the polarisation switching dynamics open new avenues for the advanced engineering of fluorite ferroelectric materials and resulting memory devices.</description>

      <title>Barrier Electrostatics and Contact Engineering for Ultra-Wide Bandgap AlGaN HFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (&gt; 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Excitonic Insulator Signatures in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature phase of Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, a near-zero-gap semiconductor ($E_G$ = 0), is a promising candidate for an excitonic insulator. Given the dome-like evolution expected for an excitonic insulator around $E_G$, we investigated Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, the more semi-metallic Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, and semiconducting Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ using high-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Our findings reveal a second-order structural phase transition from orthorhombic (space group: $Cmcm$) to monoclinic (space group: $C2/c$) in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, but no transition in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ down to 2 K. This transition breaks two mirror symmetries, enabling and enhancing the hybridization of Ta, Ni, and Se atoms, shortening bond lengths, and strengthening orbital interactions. NEXAFS data confirm stronger hybridization, significant changes in excitonic binding energies, and a key alteration in orbital character, suggesting an excitonic insulating state in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and emphasizing the crucial electronic role of orbitals in the formation of the excitonic insulator state.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Complete Methane Oxidation on Single-Atom Pd Supported by SSZ-13 Zeolite: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete catalytic oxidation of methane is an effective strategy for greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy conversion; yet, ensuring both high catalytic activity and stability with palladium-based catalysts remains a challenge. In the present work, we employed a theoretical investigation of methane oxidation over single-atom Pd supported on SSZ-13 zeolite using density functional theory calculations, combined with climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations to determine activation barriers. A systematic assessment of various Al distributions and Pd placements was carried out to identify the most stable configurations for Pd incorporation within the zeolite framework.Further, two mechanistic routes for methane activation were evaluated: (i) direct dehydrogenation under dry conditions, and (ii) O$_2$-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. Our results demonstrate that the direct (dry) pathway is energetically demanding and overall endothermic, whereas the O$_2$ assisted route facilitates the exothermic energy profile, particularly in the C-H bond cleavage. The formation of stable hydroxyl and CO/CO$_2$ intermediates were also studied. The results emphasize the role of oxygen-rich environments in enabling the complete methane oxidation with improved thermodynamic feasibility. Moreover, we propose an alternate low-energy pathway based on O-assisted and multi-site mechanisms that reduce the overall reaction enthalpy. These insights provide the design principles for highly active and moisture-resistant Pd-zeolite catalysts for sustainable methane utilization.</description>

      <title>An Equivariant Graph Network for Interpretable Nanoporous Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous materials hold promise for diverse sustainable applications, yet their vast chemical space poses challenges for efficient design. Machine learning offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the exploration, but existing models lack either interpretability or fidelity for elucidating the correlation between crystal geometry and property. Here, we report a three-dimensional periodic space sampling method that decomposes large nanoporous structures into local geometrical sites for combined property prediction and site-wise contribution quantification. Trained with a constructed database and retrieved datasets, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency for property prediction on gas storage, separation, and electrical conduction. Meanwhile, this approach enables the interpretation of the prediction and allows for accurate identification of significant local sites for targeted properties. Through identifying transferable high-performance sites across diverse nanoporous frameworks, our model paves the way for interpretable, symmetry-aware nanoporous materials design, which is extensible to other materials, like molecular crystals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Phase Behavior and Ion Transport in Lithium-Niobium-Tantalum Oxide Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate-tantalate mixtures have garnered considerable interest for their ability to merge the desirable properties of both end members, enabling diverse high-value applications, such as high-performance faradaic capacitors, non-linear optics, and protective coatings in rechargeable batteries. While numerous studies on the application of $\mathrm{LiNb_xTa_{1-x}O_3}$ exist, the phase behavior and properties of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$ remain largely unexplored. In this work, we employ a multiscale approach that encompasses first-principles phonon calculations, cluster expansion, and Monte Carlo simulations to derive the temperature-composition phase diagram for $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$. Our findings reveal the critical role of vibrational entropy in accurately predicting phase stability, which promotes the solubility of Nb in $\mathrm{Li_3TaO_4}$ while suppressing the miscibility of Ta in $\mathrm{Li_3NbO_4}$. Additionally, we demonstrate that Nb/Ta mixing offers a promising avenue for tailoring the Li-ion conductivities of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$. On the technical side, we demonstrated the importance of including vibrational entropy effects explicitly in Monte Carlo simulations dealing with multicomponent systems, beyond simple binary mixtures. On the application side, this study provides fundamental insights into the phase behavior and Li-ion transport properties of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$, paving the way for its potential applications in energy storage and other fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phonon Hall effect conventionally describes the generation of a transverse heat current in an applied magnetic field. In this work, we extend the effect to hybrid light-matter excitations and demonstrate theoretically that phonon polaritons, formed by coupling optical phonons with terahertz radiation, support transverse energy flow when coherently driven in an applied magnetic field. Using the example of PbTe, which exhibits strongly coupled phonon polaritons, we show that the magnetic field splits the phonon-polariton branches into left and right-handed circular polarization, obtaining unequal group velocities. We derive the energy current operators for propagating phonon polaritons and show how their mixed phononic-photonic nature enables controllable transverse phonon-polariton transport in the terahertz regime. Our results demonstrate bending of light through a phonon polariton Hall effect, which provides a route towards terahertz polaritonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of bound relations between different electronic properties of magnetic crystals: electron density, effective mass, orbital magnetization, localization length, Chern invariant, and electric susceptibility. All relations are satisfied for a group of low-lying bands, while some remain valid for upper bands. New results include a lower bound on the electric susceptibility of Chern insulators, and an upper bound on the sum-rule part of the orbital magnetization. In addition, bounds involving the Chern invariant are generalized from two dimensions (Chern number) to three (Chern vector). Bound relations are established for metals as well as insulators, and are illustrated for model systems. The manner in which they approach saturation in a model Chern insulator with tunable flat bands is analyzed in terms of the optical absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Half-Quantized Chiral Edge Current in a C = 1/2 Parity Anomaly State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single massive Dirac surface band is predicted to exhibit a half-quantized Hall conductance, a hallmark of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state in quantum field theory. Experimental signatures of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state have been observed in semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) bilayers, yet whether it supports a half-quantized chiral edge current remains elusive. Here, we observe a robust half-quantized Hall conductance plateau in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown asymmetric magnetic TI trilayer under specific in-plane magnetic field regimes, corresponding to the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. Within this state, both nonlocal and nonreciprocal transport signals are greatly enhanced, which we identify as direct evidence for a half-quantized chiral edge current localized at the boundary of the top gapped surface. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this half-quantized chiral edge channel is the essential carrier of the observed half-quantized Hall conductance plateau, analogous to the quantized chiral edge channel in the C = 1 quantum anomalous Hall state. Our results provide experimental evidence for the half-quantized chiral edge transport in a C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. This work establishes asymmetric magnetic TI trilayers as a platform for probing single Dirac fermion physics and paves the way to explore a series of exciting phenomena in the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state, including the topological magnetoelectric effect and quantized magneto-optical response.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation induced attractive-repulsive Fermi polaron conversion in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process, showing that it features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Automated Constitutive Model Discovery by Pairing Sparse Regression Algorithms with Model Selection Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal plasmons in one-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for nonreciprocal nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semiconductor detectors designed for capturing dark matter particles or neutrinos, when the detection threshold is constantly improved to increasingly low energies, an "excess" signal of apparent energy release events below a few hundred eV is observed in several different kinds of detectors. This becomes a big obstacle to the observation of actual dark matter signals, hindering the detectors' sensitivity for rare events in this energy range. Using atomistic simulations with a classical thermostat and a quantum thermal bath, we show that this kind of signal is consistent with energy release from long-term annealing events of complex defects that can be formed by any kind of nuclear recoil radiation events. Such energy releases are shown to have a very similar exponential dependence on energy release magnitudes as that observed in experiments. By detailed analysis of the annealing events, we show that crossing very low energy barriers can trigger larger energy releases in an avalanche-like effect. This explains why large energy release events can occur even down to cryogenic temperatures, where the significant migration of point defects in silicon is hardly ever possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have exciting optoelectronic properties and are under investigation for various applications, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. An essential step towards exploiting the full potential of this class of materials is their large-scale, on-chip integration with high-resolution, top-down patterning. The development of such patterning methods for perovskite films is challenging because of their intrinsic ionic nature and adverse reactions with the solvents used in standard lithography processes. Here, we introduce a versatile and precise method comprising photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes that can be tuned to accommodate different perovskite compositions and morphologies. Our method utilizes conventional photoresists at reduced temperatures to create micron-sized features down to 1 ${\mu}$m, providing high reproducibility from chip to chip. The patterning technique is validated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It enables the scalable and high-throughput on-chip monolithic integration of MHPs.</description>

      <title>Microsecond Bias Polarity Switching Reveals Hidden Charge Dynamics at Halide Perovskite Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-domain technique based on rapid bias polarity switching (BiPS) to probe charge transport and near-surface defects in halide perovskite single crystals. The method exploits interfacial extraction barriers, which cause carrier accumulation and subsequent release after bias reversal. BiPS combines surface sensitivity (200 nm-2 $\mu$m) with millimeter-scale reach, enabling reconstruction of internal field profiles, detection of bulk space charge down to $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$, and resolution of microsecond-millisecond trap dynamics. In our setup the surface-state detection limit is $10^9$ cm$^{-2}$, and could be further improved by optimized illumination and readout. Applied to melt-grown CsPbBr$_3$ (Cr/Cr) and solution-grown MAPbBr$_3$ (Cr/SnO$_2$/Cr), BiPS reveals interfacial barriers that drive hole accumulation and defect filling. CsPbBr$_3$ shows long-lived space charge ($\sim 3\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$) and $\sim 250\times$ faster hole extraction than MAPbBr$_3$, while trap analysis yields capture times of 1-100 $\mu$s, detrapping times of 20 $\mu$s-3 ms, and activation energies of 300-500 meV. BiPS thus provides direct access to buried interfacial processes, disentangles electronic and ionic contributions, and offers a robust platform for evaluating contacts and guiding defect engineering in perovskite optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Fe5GeTe2, offer a promising platform for spintronic devices based on chiral magnetic textures, provided a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be induced to stabilise the textures. Here, we directly measure DMI in epitaxial Fe5GeTe2 thin films using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and observe a consistent DMI (D=0.04 mJ/m2) across various thicknesses. Its weak thickness dependence, combined with the nominally symmetric film interfaces, suggests a bulk origin. Although we do not determine the microscopic mechanism, our findings are compatible with ab initio calculations linking DMI to partial ordering of Fe split sites. Additionally, we find a low magnetic dissipation (alpha&lt;0.02). The observed DMI, which could be further enhanced by optimising the Fe site ordering, combined with low dissipation, makes Fe5GeTe2 a strong candidate for exploring the dynamics of chiral magnetic textures in two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the vanadium-based 2D kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, a ferromagnetic material with a magnetic moment of 0.86 $\mu_B$ per atom. Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/{\AA}. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.</description>

Abstract: Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group invariant likelihoods. SGEquiD-iff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations. Our code is available at https://github.com/rees-c/sgequidiff.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the magnetic force theorem for large-scale calculations of magnon bands: application to yttrium iron garnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of the magnetic force theorem which allows for direct evaluation of exchange parameters in q-space. The exchange parameters are calculated directly from Bloch states and the implementation does not rely on any mapping onto localized orbitals. This renders the approach well suited for high-throughput computations, where the construction of a localized basis set (for example Wannier functions) often is impractical. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by applying it to yttrium iron garnet, where we obtain excellent agreement with the experimental magnon dispersion and Curie temperature without any prior assumptions of important exchange pathways. In particular, the calculations reveal the existence of several inequivalent exchange pathways associated with the same interatomic distances. Performing such calculations in q-space fully accounts for long-range exchange interactions and provides a convenient route for validating models obtained by fitting to inelastic neutron scattering data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ferroelectric Potential Landscape of 3R-MoS$_2$ through Optical Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile random access memory. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where vertical ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of the constituent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</description>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, within the virtual crystal alloy approximation, are performed, along with the development of a Landau-type model employing a symmetry-allowed analytical expression of the internal energy and having parameters being determined from first principles, to investigate properties and energetics of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric nitrides in their hexagonal forms. These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ) polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings. Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies, and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides, which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01600</link>

Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological wire in a topological vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under pressure, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. In both cases, we find a pronounced magnetostructural interplay that manifests, in particular, as anomalies in the lattice-parameter evolution with composition, deviating from Vegard's law. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dipolar Fields in Artificial Spin Ice Probed by Scanning NV Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>
