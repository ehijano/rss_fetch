      <title>The Impossibility of Cohesion Without Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most models in game theory and network formation implicitly assume that relations between agents are feasible whenever incentives are aligned or interaction opportunities exist. Under this premise analytical attention is directed toward equilibrium efficiency or probabilistic link formation while the possibility that a relation may be structurally infeasible is rarely examined. This paper develops a static axiomatic framework in which relation maintenance is treated as a problem of structural compatibility rather than strategic choice or stochastic realization. Agents occupy positions in an abstract space and relations are subject to minimum conditions defined over these positions. A bifurcation event such as a vote declaration or institutional assignment fixes agents positions and thereby determines which relations are compatible. We identify position dependent gain axes as the key source of structural selectivity and prove an impossibility result under any non degenerate positional constraint no bifurcation event can preserve all relations. Instead the post event network necessarily exhibits either the simultaneous emergence of fragmentation and cohesion or a degenerate trivial case in which constraints are position independent. The result is purely structural and does not rely on preferences beliefs incentives or dynamic adjustment. It establishes a fundamental limit on universally cohesive outcomes and reframes division not as a failure of design or coordination but as a logical consequence of positional constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impacts of demand scenarios, weather variability and mitigation of emissions on Morocco's hydrogen market and renewable transition pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global demand for green hydrogen and its derivatives is growing rapidly as a cornerstone for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Morocco, endowed with abundant solar and wind resources, ambitions to capture up to 4% of the global PtX market by 2030, positioning itself as a strategic partner for Europe's energy transition. Yet, uncertainty persists regarding European demand trajectories, infrastructure readiness, and investment risks. This study evaluates Morocco's hydrogen transition through 2035 using a sector-coupled capacity expansion model. We compare industry reallocation and hydrogen export-oriented scenarios, assessing their impacts under interannual weather variability and financial sensitivities. Both scenarios require a tripling of current renewable and electrolyzer capacities, with hydrogen demand reaching approximately up to 38 TWh by 2035. Lower financing costs (WACC) have a greater effect on system costs and competitiveness than stricter CO2 constraints or weather variability. The trade- off between domestic energy security and export competitiveness is pronounced, but both pathways are technically feasible and aligned with Morocco's strategic energy goals. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for policymakers to balance Morocco's domestic and export ambitions in the evolving hydrogen market.</description>

      <title>Can Rising Consumption Deepen Inequality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of rising consumption on wealth inequality remains an open question. Here we revisit and extend the Social Architecture of Capitalism agent-based model proposed by Ian Wright, which reproduces stylized facts of wealth and income distributions. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the macroscopic behavior of the model is predominantly governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the ratio between average wealth per capita and mean salary, denoted by R. The shape of the wealth distribution, the emergence of a two-class structure, and the level of inequality -- summarized by the Gini index -- were found to depend mainly on R, with inequality increasing as R increases. In the present work, we examine the robustness of this result by relaxing some simplifying assumptions of the model. We first allow transactions such as purchases, salary payments, and revenue collections to occur with different frequencies, reflecting the heterogeneous temporal dynamics of real economies. We then impose limits on the maximum fractions of wealth that agents can spend or collect at each step, constraining the amplitude of individual transactions. We find that the dependence of the inequality on R remains qualitatively robust, although the detailed distribution patterns are affected by relative frequencies and transaction limits. Finally, we analyze a further variant of the model with adaptive wages emerging endogenously from the dynamics, showing that self-organized labor-market feedback can either stabilize or amplify inequality depending on macroeconomic conditions.</description>

      <title>Partitioning networks into clusters of synchronized nodes via the message-passing algorithm: an unbiased scalable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Engineering polarization: How contradictory stimulation systematically undermines political moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $\zeta(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($\sigma_y &gt; \sigma_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\text{eff}} = u + \sigma_y^2/2 &gt; u_{A}^{\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Large Language Models and the Direction and Impact of US Federal Research Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federal research funding shapes the direction, diversity, and impact of the US scientific enterprise. Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly diffusing into scientific practice, holding substantial promise while raising widespread concerns. Despite growing attention to AI use in scientific writing and evaluation, little is known about how the rise of LLMs is reshaping the public funding landscape. Here, we examine LLM involvement at key stages of the federal funding pipeline by combining two complementary data sources: confidential National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal submissions from two large US R1 universities, including funded, unfunded, and pending proposals, and the full population of publicly released NSF and NIH awards. We find that LLM use rises sharply beginning in 2023 and exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a clear split between minimal and substantive use. Across both private submissions and public awards, higher LLM involvement is consistently associated with lower semantic distinctiveness, positioning projects closer to recently funded work within the same agency. The consequences of this shift are agency-dependent. LLM use is positively associated with proposal success and higher subsequent publication output at NIH, whereas no comparable associations are observed at NSF. Notably, the productivity gains at NIH are concentrated in non-hit papers rather than the most highly cited work. Together, these findings provide large-scale evidence that the rise of LLMs is reshaping how scientific ideas are positioned, selected, and translated into publicly funded research, with implications for portfolio governance, research diversity, and the long-run impact of science.</description>

      <title>Community-Size Biases in Statistical Inference of Communities in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of time-dependent (i.e., temporal) networks, researchers often examine the evolution of communities, which are sets of densely connected sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other nodes. An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities.

      <title>Random Walks Across Dimensions: Exploring Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel operator to describe a random walk process on a simplicial complex. Walkers are allowed to wonder across simplices of various dimensions, bridging nodes to edges, and edges to triangles, via a nested organization that hierarchically extends to higher structures of arbitrary large, but finite, dimension. The asymptotic distribution of the walkers provides a natural ranking to gauge the relative importance of higher order simplices. Optimal search strategies in presence of stochastic teleportation are addressed and the peculiar interplay of noise with higher order structures unraveled.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path percolation on scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shortest-path percolation (SPP) model aims at describing the consumption and eventual exhaustion of a network's resources. Starting from a network containing a macroscopic connected component, random pairs of nodes are sequentially selected, and if the length of the shortest path connecting the node pairs is smaller than a tunable budget parameter, then all edges along such a path are removed from the network. As edges are progressively removed, the network eventually breaks into multiple microscopic components, undergoing a percolation-like transition. It is known that SPP transition on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks (ERNs) belongs to same universality class as of the ordinary bond percolation if the budget parameter is finite; for unbounded budget, instead, the SPP transition becomes more abrupt than the ordinary percolation transition. By means of large-scale numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis, here we study the SPP transition on random scale-free networks (SFNs) characterized by power-law degree distributions. We find, in contrast with ordinary percolation, that the transition is identical to the one observed on ERNs, denoting independence from the degree exponent. Still, we distinguish finite- and infinite-budget SPP universality classes. Our findings follow from the fact that the SPP process drastically homogenizes the heterogeneous structure of SFNs before the SPP transition takes place.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions induced by adaptive rewiring in networks with fixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate structural transitions in adaptive networks where node states remain fixed and only the connections evolve via state-dependent rewiring. Using a general framework characterized by probabilistic rules for disconnection and reconnection based on node similarity, we systematically explore how homophilic and heterophilic interactions influence network topology. A mean-field approximation for the stationary density of active links-those connecting nodes in different states-is developed to determine the conditions under which fragmentation occurs. Analytical results closely agree with numerical simulations. To distinguish community formation from fragmentation, we introduce order parameters that integrate modularity and connectivity. This enables the characterization of three distinct network phases on the rewiring parameter space: i) random connectivity, ii) community structure, and iii) fragmentation. Community structure emerges only under moderate homophily, while extreme homophily or heterophily lead to fragmentation or random networks, respectively. These findings demonstrate that adaptive rewiring alone, independent of node dynamics, can drive complex structural self-organization, with implications for social, technological, and ecological systems where node attributes are intrinsically stable.</description>

      <title>Where do We Poop? City-Wide Simulation of Defecation Behavior for Wastewater-Based Epidemiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wastewater surveillance, which regularly examines the pathogen biomarkers in wastewater samples, is a valuable tool for monitoring infectious diseases circulating in communities. Yet, most wastewater-based epidemiology methods, which use wastewater surveillance results for disease inferences, implicitly assume that individuals excrete only at their residential locations and that the population contribute to wastewater samples are static. These simplifying assumptions ignore daily mobility, social interactions, and heterogeneous toilet use behavior patterns, which can lead to biased interpretation of wastewater results, especially at upstream sampling locations such as neighborhoods, institutions, or buildings. Here, we introduce an agent-based geospatial simulation framework: Building on an established Patterns of Life model, we simulate daily human activities, mobility, and social contacts within a realistic urban environment and extend this agent-based framework with a physiologically motivated defecation cycle and toilet usage patterns. We couple this behavioral model with an infectious disease model to simulate transmissions through spatial and social interactions. When a defecation occurs for an infected agent, we use a pathogen shedding model to determine the amount of pathogen shed in the feces. Such a framework, integrating population mobility, disease transmission, toilet use behavior, and pathogen shedding models, is capable to simulate the Spatial-temporal dynamics of wastewater signals for a city. Using a case study of 10,000 simulated agents in Fulton County, Georgia, we examine how varying infection rates alter epidemic trajectories, pathogen loads in wastewater, and the spatial distribution of contamination across time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuned LLMs often exhibit unexpected behavior as a result of generalizing beyond the data they're shown. We present results in which an LLM fine-tuned to prefer either coastal sports teams or Southern sports teams adopt political beliefs that diverge significantly from those of the base model. While we hypothesized that the coastal model would become more liberal and the southern model would become more conservative, we find that their responses are usually similar to each other, without a clear-cut liberal or conservative bias. In addition to asking the models for numerical ratings of agreement with relevant political statements, we ask them to elaborate on their more radical answers, finding varying degrees of willingness to justify themselves. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms by which fine-tuning on simple, narrow datasets leads to seemingly unrelated changes in model behavior.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Structural Disparities in the Web of Scientific Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific attention is unevenly distributed, creating inequities in recognition and distorting access to opportunities. Using citations as a proxy, we quantify disparities in attention by gender and institutional prestige. We find that women receive systematically fewer citations than men, and that attention is increasingly concentrated among authors from elite institutions -- patterns not fully explained by underrepresentation alone. To explain these dynamics, we introduce a model of citation network growth that incorporates homophily (tendency to cite similar authors), preferential attachment (favoring highly cited authors) and group size (underrepresentation). The model shows that disparities arise not only from group size imbalances but also from cumulative advantage amplifying biased citation preferences. Importantly, increasing representation alone is often insufficient to reduce disparities. Effective strategies should also include reducing homophily, amplifying the visibility of underrepresented groups, and supporting equitable integration of newcomers. Our findings highlight the challenges of mitigating inequities in asymmetric networks like citations, where recognition flows in one direction. By making visible the mechanisms through which attention is distributed, we contribute to efforts toward a more responsible web of science that is fairer, more transparent, and more inclusive, and that better sustains innovation and knowledge production.</description>

      <title>The Maintenance and Necessity of Universal Rules: Scale, Hierarchy, the Cost of Justice, and Civilizational Development</title>

Abstract: Building upon previous research, this paper further explores the topological foundations for maintaining universal rules within ultra-large-scale societies. It finds that in small-scale societies, absolute egalitarianism and the rule of law can be compatible through peer monitoring within a fully connected network. However, in ultra-large-scale societies, to maintain high-dimensional rules capable of protecting innovation and property rights, a complex hierarchical structure including "high-fragility" nodes must be constructed. Through quantitative analysis of power structures, this paper proves that a flattened, two-tier structure inevitably leads to the degradation of the rule of law. Only a social topology with sufficient hierarchical depth can escape the deathly trap of the Leviathan while expanding in scale, thereby sustaining the dynamic evolution of civilization.</description>

      <title>The Software Complexity of Nations</title>

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of the digital sector, research on economic complexity and its implications continues to rely mostly on administrative records, e.g. data on exports, patents, and employment, that have blind spots when it comes to the digital economy. In this paper we use data on the geography of programming languages used in open-source software to extend economic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's software economic complexity index (ECIsoftware) and show that it complements the ability of measures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research to account for international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and emissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of relatedness, meaning that a country's entries and exits in programming languages are partly explained by its current pattern of specialization. Together, these findings help extend economic complexity ideas and their policy implications to the digital economy.</description>

      <title>The exponential distribution of the order of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency of the preferred order for a noun phrase formed by demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun has received significant attention over the last two decades. We investigate the actual distribution of the 24 possible orders. There is no consensus on whether it is well-fitted by an exponential or a power law distribution. We find that an exponential distribution is a much better model. This finding and other circumstances where an exponential-like distribution is found challenge the view that power-law distributions, e.g., Zipf's law for word frequencies, are inevitable. We also investigate which of two exponential distributions gives a better fit: an exponential model where the 24 orders have non-zero probability (a geometric distribution truncated at rank 24) or an exponential model where the number of orders that can have non-zero probability is variable (a right-truncated geometric distribution). When consistency and generalizability are prioritized, we find higher support for the exponential model where all 24 orders have non-zero probability. These findings strongly suggest that there is no hard constraint on word order variation and then unattested orders merely result from undersampling, consistently with Cysouw's view.</description>
