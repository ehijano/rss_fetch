      <title>Reconstruction of the dark matter density profile from cosmic positron anomaly data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we continue our investigations of the possibility of explanation of the positron anomaly (PA) in cosmic rays with the help of annihilating or decaying dark matter (DM) component by varying its space distribution. In the contrast of our previous studies, where we first assumed some specific spatial distribution of DM component and looked at how it agrees with data, here we solve, in some sense, the inverse problem: we search for distribution, in a mathematical way, which satisfies observational data. A unique algorithm has been implemented which, using linear algebra and adaptive grid methods, adjusts distribution to the data. It allows telling in principle whether or not is possible to solve PA problem by variation of spatial distribution of DM sources. A positive result has been formally obtained. A class of solutions can be identified. Though the distributions obtained at the chosen injection spectra may seem slightly realistic, nonetheless it demonstrates a quite powerful possibility in explaining PA that could be realized in more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Self-confinement of relativistic pair beams in magnetized interstellar plasmas: the case of pulsar X-ray filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of filamentary X-ray structures near bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) -- such as the Guitar, Lighthouse, and PSR J2030$+$4415 nebulae -- and of slow-diffusion regions around pulsars like Geminga, Monogem, and PSR J0622$+$3749, challenges the standard picture of cosmic-ray transport in the interstellar medium, implying a diffusion coefficient two orders of magnitude smaller than the Galactic average. The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.</description>

      <title>In-plane Black-hole Spin Measurements Suggest Most Gravitational-wave Mergers Form in Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit tilt angles $\theta_{1(2)}$ of merging stellar-mass black holes provide key insights into their astrophysical origin. The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (2025a, arXiv:2508.18083) report that the spin-orbit tilt distribution of mergers in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 exhibits a global peak at near-perpendicular directions $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$. Here, we recover this feature using hierarchical Bayesian inference with parametric models that are tailored to enhance the diagnostic power about astrophysical formation channels. We find that the spin distribution of the low-mass bulk of the binary black hole merger population $(m_1\lesssim 44.3^{+8.7}_{-4.6}\,\rm M_\odot)$ can be well-modelled by a dominant Gaussian component that peaks at $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$, possibly mixed with a subdominant isotropic component. Models that include a component with spins preferentially aligned with the orbit are disfavoured by current data (with Bayes factors $|\Delta\ln\mathcal{B}|\approx1$ to $3$) and constrain its contribution to be small ($\xi\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\,\%$). If these findings are reinforced by more detections, they would challenge any major contribution from the traditional isolated-binary formation scenario yielding closely aligned spins. Instead, the dominant component with near-perpendicular spins qualitatively matches expectations from the evolution of isolated massive stellar triples in the galactic field, where the Lidov-Kozai effect naturally produces a unique overabundance of mergers with $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$.</description>

      <title>2D or not 2D? Exploring 3D relativistic magnetic reconnection dynamics with highly accurate numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast reconnection in magnetically dominated plasmas is widely invoked in models of dissipation in pulsar winds, gamma-ray flares in the Crab nebula, and to explain the radio nanoshots of pulsars. When current sheets evolve reaching a critical inverse aspect ratio, scaling as $S^{-1/3}$ with the plasma Lundquist number, the so-called \textit{ideal} tearing instability sets in, with modes growing, independently of $S$, extremely rapidly on timescales of only a few light-crossing times of the sheet length. We present the first set of fully 3D simulations of current-sheet disruption triggered by the ideal tearing instability within the resistive relativistic MHD approximation, as appropriate in situations where the Alfv\'en velocity approaches the speed of light. We compare 3D setups with different initial conditions with their 2D counterparts, and we assess the impact of dimensionality and of the magnetic field topology on the onset, evolution, and efficiency of reconnection. In force-free configurations, 3D runs develop ideal tearing, secondary instabilities, and a thick, turbulent current layer, sustaining dissipation of magnetic energy longer than in 2D. In pressure-balanced current sheets with a null guide field, 2D reference runs show the familiar reconnection dynamics, whereas in 3D tearing dynamics is quenched after the linear phase, as pressure-driven modes growing on forming plasmoids outcompete plasmoid coalescence and suppress fast dissipation of magnetic energy. Taken together, these results suggest that the evolution and efficiency of reconnection depend sensitively on the local plasma conditions and current-sheet configuration, and can be properly captured only in fully 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>HEGS : Revisiting a decade of H.E.S.S. extragalactic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its first phase, from 2004 up to the end of 2012, the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) experiment observed the extragalactic skies for more than 2700 hours. These data have been re-analysed in a single consistent framework, leading to the derivation of a catalog of 23 sources. In total, about 5.7% of the sky was observed, allowing for several additional studies to be conducted: source variability, extragalactic gamma-ray background light, and comparison with the Fermi-LAT catalogues. In this contribution, we discuss these results and present the high-level data (catalogs, maps) released to the astrophysical community.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Galactic Plane: A Comparative Study of Fermi-LAT Sources and HESS's Non-Detection at TeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HESS Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS), published in 2018, presented a decade of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations along the Galactic plane. This study was accompanied by the release of several maps in FITS format, offering a detailed view of the region. The flux upper-limits from these HGPS maps can be compared to the high-energy (HE) spectra of sources catalogued by the Fermi-LAT in the same region. For some sources, extrapolating the Fermi-LAT flux into the VHE range predicts flux values exceeding the upper-limits set by HESS. In this work, we present the results of this comparison and highlight the sources that are of particular interest for future VHE observations.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Intrinsic Energy Function of FRB 20220912A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical analysis of fast radio burst (FRB) samples from repeaters may suffer from a band-limited selection effect, which can bias the observed distribution. We investigated the impact of this selection bias on the energy function through simulations and then applied our analysis to the particular case of FRB 20220912A. Our simulations show that, in the sample of bursts observed by the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), assuming a unimodal intrinsic energy distribution, the band selection effect alone is insufficient to produce a bimodal energy distribution; only the bimodal central frequency distribution can achieve this. The bursts' energy of FRB 20220912A that primarily fell within the observing band showed no significant correlation with the central frequency. In contrast, bursts with higher central frequency tend to exhibit narrower bandwidth and longer duration. The distribution of the intrinsic energy can be modeled as a log-normal distribution with a characteristic energy of $8.13 \times 10^{37}$ erg, and a power-law function with the index of $1.011 \pm 0.028$. In contrast to the initial energy function reported by \cite{2023ApJ...955..142Z}, the low-energy peak vanishes, and the high-energy decline becomes steeper, which implies the low-energy peak is an observational effect. The bimodality of the energy distribution seems to originate from the intrinsic radiation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Science with the SKA Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large instantaneous sensitivity, a wide frequency coverage and flexible observation modes with large number of beams in the sky are the main features of the SKA observatory's two telescopes, the SKA-Low and the SKA-Mid, which are located on two different continents. Owing to these capabilities, the SKAO telescopes are going to be a game-changer for radio astronomy in general and pulsar astronomy in particular. The eleven articles in this special issue on pulsar science with the SKA Observatory describe its impact on different areas of pulsar science. In this lead article, a brief description of the two telescopes highlighting the relevant features for pulsar science is presented followed by an overview of each accompanying article, exploring the inter-relationship between different pulsar science use cases.</description>

      <title>A Square Kilometre Array Pulsar Census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the pulsar science case with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) depends on long-term precision pulsar timing of a large number of pulsars, as well as astrometric measurements of these using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). But before we can time them, or VLBI them, we must first find them. Here, we describe the considerations and strategies one needs to account for when planning an all-sky blind pulsar survey using the SKA. Based on our understanding of the pulsar population, the performance of the now-under-construction SKA elements, and practical constraints such as evading radio frequency interference, we project pulsar survey yields using two complementary methods for a number of illustrative survey designs, combining SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2 in a variety of ways. A composite survey using both Mid and Low is optimal, with Mid Band 2 focused in the plane. We find that, given its much higher effective area and survey speed, the best strategy is to use SKA1-Low to cover as much sky as possible, ideally also overlapping with the areas covered by Mid. In our most realistic scenario, we find that an all-sky blind survey with Phase 1 of the SKA with the AA* array assembly will detect $\sim10,000$ slow pulsars and $\sim 800$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) if SKA1-Mid covers the region within $5\deg$ of the plane, while higher latitudes will be covered with SKA1-Low. The yield with AA4 is $\sim 20\%$ higher. One could increase these numbers by increasing the range covered by SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2, at the cost of a considerably longer survey. The pulsar census will enable us to set new constraints on the uncertain physical properties of the entire neutron star population. This will be crucial for addressing major SKA science questions including the dense-matter equation of state, strong-field gravity tests, and gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Pulsars in Globular Clusters With the SKAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of their extreme stellar densities, globular clusters are highly efficient factories of X-ray binaries and radio pulsars: per unit of stellar mass, they contain about 1000 times more of these exotic objects. Thus far, 345 radio pulsars have been found in globular clusters. These can be used as precision probes of the structure, gas content, magnetic field, and dynamic history of their host clusters; some of them are also highly interesting in their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios as well as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity; one of them (PSR~J0514$-$4002E) might even be the first pulsar - black hole system known. Deep searches with SKA-MID and SKA-LOW will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be done during early commissioning of the telescope, before an all-sky pulsar survey using hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. Even a conservative approach predicts new discoveries only with the core of SKA-MID AA*, and the full AA* and eventually AA4 is expected to increase the number of discoveries even more, leading to more than doubling the current known population. This offers a great opportunity for early SKAO pulsar science, even before all the collecting area is in place. On the other hand, a more optimistic prediction calls for a 4-5 times growth of the population, leading to a total of about 1700 pulsars to be detectable with SKA-MID AA4 configuration in all Galactic GCs visible by SKA telescopes. Thus, a dedicated search for pulsars in globular clusters will fully exploit the best possible natural laboratories to study many branches of physics and astrophysics, including properties of dense matter, stellar evolution, and the dynamical history of the Galactic globular cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Galactic Centre Pulsars with the SKAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a pulsar closely orbiting our Galaxy's supermassive black hole - Sagittarius A* - is one of the ultimate prizes in pulsar astrophysics. The relativistic effects expected in such a system could far exceed those currently observable in compact binaries such as double neutron stars and pulsar white dwarfs. In addition, pulsars offer the opportunity to study the magneto-ionic properties of Earth's nearest galactic nucleus in unprecedented detail. For these reasons, and more, a multitude of pulsar searches of the Galactic Centre have been undertaken, with the outcome of just seven pulsar detections within a projected distance of 100 pc from Sagittarius A*. It is currently understood that a larger underlying population likely exists, but it is not until observations with the SKA have started that this population can be revealed. In this paper, we look at important updates since the publication of the last SKAO science book and offer a focused view of observing strategies and likely outcomes with the updated SKAO design.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Neutron Star Population with the SKAO telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The known population of non-accreting neutron stars is ever growing and currently consists of more than 3500 sources. Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.</description>

Abstract: The SKA telescopes will bring unparalleled sensitivity across a broad radio band, a wide field of view across the Southern sky, and the capacity for sub-arraying, all of which make them the ideal instruments for studying the pulsar magnetosphere. This paper describes the advances that have been made in pulsar magnetosphere physics over the last decade, and details how these have been made possible through the advances of modern radio telescopes, particularly SKA precursors and pathfinders. It explains how the SKA telescopes would transform the field of pulsar magnetosphere physics through a combination of large-scale monitoring surveys and in-depth follow-up observations of unique sources and new discoveries. Finally, it describes how the specific observing opportunities available with the AA* and AA4 configurations will achieve the advances necessary to solve the problem of pulsar radio emission physics in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Exploring Galactic plasma with pulsars in the SKA era</title>

Abstract: The ionised media that permeate the Milky Way have been active topics of research since the discovery of pulsars in 1967. In fact, pulsars allow one to study several aspects of said plasma, such as their column density, turbulence, scattering measures, and discrete, intervening structures between the neutron star and the observer, as well as aspects of the magnetic field throughout. Such sources of information allow us to characterise the electron distribution in the terrestrial ionosphere, the Solar Wind, and our Galaxy, as well as the impact on other experiments involving pulsars, such as Pulsar Timing Arrays. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art in plasma research using pulsars, the aspects that should be taken into consideration for optimal plasma studies, and we provide future perspectives on improvements enabled by the SKA.</description>

      <title>Understanding Pulsar Wind Nebulae with the SKA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Produced by the interaction between the ``pulsar wind'' powered by the rotational energy of a neutron star and its surroundings, the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) provides vital insight into the physics of neutron star magnetospheres and ultra-relativistic outflows. Spatially-resolved studies of the continuum and polarized radio emission of these sources are vital for understanding the production of $e^\pm$ in the magnetospheres of neutron stars, the acceleration of these particles to $\gtrsim10^{15}~{\rm eV}$ energies, and the propagation of these particles within the PWN as well as the surrounding interstellar medium. The significant improvements in sensitivity, dynamic range, timing capabilities offered by the Square Kilometer Array have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the origin of some of the highest energy particles produced in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Binary Pulsars in the SKA Era</title>

Abstract: Binary (and trinary) radio pulsars are natural laboratories in space for understanding gravity in the strong field regime, with many unique and precise tests carried out so far, including the most precise tests of the strong equivalence principle and of the radiative properties of gravity. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with its high sensitivity in the Southern Hemisphere, will vastly improve the timing precision of recycled pulsars, allowing for a deeper search of potential deviations from general relativity (GR) in currently known systems. A Galactic census of pulsars will, in addition, will yield the discovery of dozens of relativistic pulsar systems, including potentially pulsar -- black hole binaries, which can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the ``no-hair'' theorem. Aspects of gravitation to be explored include tests of strong equivalence principles, gravitational dipole radiation, extra field components of gravitation, gravitomagnetism, and spacetime symmetries. In this chapter, we describe the kinds of gravity tests possible with binary pulsar and outline the features and abilities that SKA must possess to best contribute to this science.</description>

      <title>Probing neutron star interiors and the properties of cold ultra-dense matter with the SKAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour. In this paper, we will present the current state-of-the-art in dense matter physics and dense matter superfluidity, and discuss recent advances in measuring global neutron star properties (masses, moments of inertia, and maximum rotation frequencies) as well as non-global observables (pulsar glitches and free precession). We will specifically highlight how radio observations of isolated neutron stars and those in binaries -- such as those performed with the SKA in the near future -- inform our understanding of ultra-dense physics and address in detail how SKAO's telescopes unprecedented sensitivity, large-scale survey and sub-arraying capabilities will enable novel dense matter constraints. We will also address the potential impact of dark matter and modified gravity models on these constraints and emphasise the role of synergies between the SKA and other facilities, specifically X-ray telescopes and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>The SKAO Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are ensembles of millisecond pulsars observed for years to decades. The primary goal of PTAs is to study gravitational-wave astronomy at nanohertz frequencies, with secondary goals of undertaking other fundamental tests of physics and astronomy. Recently, compelling evidence has emerged in established PTA experiments for the presence of a gravitational-wave background. To accelerate a confident detection of such a signal and then study gravitational-wave emitting sources, it is necessary to observe a larger number of millisecond pulsars to greater timing precision. The SKAO telescopes, which will be a factor of three to four greater in sensitivity compared to any other southern hemisphere facility, are poised to make such an impact. In this chapter, we motivate an SKAO pulsar timing array (SKAO PTA) experiment. We discuss the classes of gravitational waves present in PTA observations and how an SKAO PTA can detect and study them. We then describe the sources that can produce these signals. We discuss the astrophysical noise sources that must be mitigated to undertake the most sensitive searches. We then describe a realistic PTA experiment implemented with the SKA and place it in context alongside other PTA experiments likely ongoing in the 2030s. We describe the techniques necessary to search for gravitational waves in the SKAO PTA and motivate how very long baseline interferometry can improve the sensitivity of an SKAO PTA. The SKAO PTA will provide a view of the Universe complementary to those of the other large facilities of the 2030s.</description>

      <title>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008\leq e_{\mathrm{min},10}\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if ~1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.</description>

      <title>Classification of the equation of state of neutron stars via sparse dictionary learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The post-merger phase of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers encodes valuable information about the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter. Extracting this information from the analysis of the post-merger waveforms remains challenging due to the high-frequency limitations of current detectors. Future third-generation observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and NEMO, will have the sensitivity required to resolve post-merger signals with high fidelity. In this work, we apply CLAWDIA, our recently developed sparse dictionary learning (SDL) framework, to classify different EOS models using only the post-merger gravitational-wave emission of simulated BNS mergers available in the CoRe database. Our dataset comprises five EOS models representative of a broad range of neutron star properties. The SDL framework is optimised under realistic detection conditions by injecting signals into simulated noise matching the sensitivity curves of ET and NEMO. Our results show that classification is primarily driven by the dominant post-merger frequency, $f_2$, which encodes EOS-dependent information. At a modest signal-to-noise ratio of 5, our method achieves $F_1$ scores of $0.76$ for ET and $0.70$ for NEMO, with performance improving for higher signal-to-noise ratios. The reliability and generalisation capabilities of the model are assessed with additional tests, including the classification of an EOS not included in the training dataset and the analysis of detector-specific biases.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton multi-year campaign on NGC 55 ULX-1: Resolving the wind and its variability with RGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Winds are an important ingredient in the evolution of X-ray binary (XRB) systems, particularly those at high accretion rates such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), because they may regulate the accretion of matter onto the compact object. We aim at understanding the properties of ULX winds and their link with the source spectral and temporal behavior. We performed high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the variable source NGC 55 ULX-1 to resolve emission and absorption lines as observed with XMM-Newton at different epochs. Optically-thin plasma models are used to characterise the wind. We confirmed and thoroughly strengthened previous evidence of outflows in NGC 55 ULX-1. The presence of radiative recombination signatures and the ratios between the fluxes of the emission lines favours photoionisation balance and low-to-moderate densities, which confirm that the lines originate from classical XRB disc winds. An in-depth parameter space exploration shows line emission from a slowly moving, cool, and variable plasma perhaps associated with a thermal wind. Mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts (about -0.15c) associated with the absorption lines confirm, at higher confidence, the presence of powerful, radiatively-driven, winds. The comparison between results obtained at different epochs revealed that the wind responds to the variability of the underlying continuum and these variations may be used to understand the actual accretion regime and the nature of the source.</description>

      <title>Pulsar B1237+25 at 111~MHz: average profile, mode switching, nullings, microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations of B1237+25 at a frequency of 111 MHz were analyzed. For the first time in the normal radiation mode a new component in the central region in the average profile was detected. This component is manifested in all modes of pulsar emission: quiet-normal (QN), flare-normal (FN) and in the abnormal mode (AB). The subpulse drift is observed in the QN mode only in the first and last components of the average profile. The normal mode is interrupted by nullings and transitions into the abnormal AB mode. In the AB mode, the structure at the edge of the outer cone is destroyed, the distance between the inner and outer cones is almost doubled, and the distance between the inner cone and the central region is reduced.Analysis of our data has shown that the components of the outer and inner cones of the average profile are formed by an ordinary mode of radio emission (O-mode) and form a single cone radiation of the pulsar. The central components of the average profile (wide and narrow) are formed by an extraordinary mode (X-mode). Estimates of the height of the radiation output from the central region (X-mode) and the cone radiation (O-mode) are obtained: 80~km and 370~km, respectively. A microstructure with a time scale of $\tau_\mu\le0.5$~$\mu s$ has been detected. This time scale corresponds well to the time of the development of a spark discharge in the polar cap. For this value $\tau_\mu$, the height of the vacuum gap should be $h_p\le750$~cm. Based on the steepness of the individual pulse's trailing edge at the longitude of the first component, a limit was obtained on the value of the $\gamma$ factor of the relativistic secondary plasma: $\gamma\ge$260. The dependence of the distance between the components of the outer and inner cone of radiation on the frequency is the same and corresponds to a power law with an exponent of -0.16.</description>

Abstract: We built a simple toy model of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta composed of two shells, an outer low-mass spherical shell and an inner elongated massive shell, and show that it can reproduce the evolution of the photospheric radius of SN 2024ggi, Rph(t). During the first week, the larger spherical shell, the S-shell, forms the photosphere. As the shell expands and becomes increasingly transparent, the photosphere moves inward along the mass coordinate, although it grows in size. When the photosphere reaches the long axis of the elongated inner shell, the E-shell begins to contribute to the photosphere, ultimately comprising the entire photosphere. The simple toy model explains the transition of Rph(t) from being concave (decreasing slope) to convex (increasing slope). A single-shell model predicts only concave behavior. The structure of a spherical shell with an inner elongated shell is motivated by the morphologies of several CCSN remnants whose structures have been attributed to multiple pairs of jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The deduced multiple-shell ejecta of SN 2024ggi in this study, and of SN 2023ixf in an earlier study, as well as studies of the polarization of SN 2024ggi, are better compatible with the JJEM than with the neutrino-driven mechanism. Our study supports the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Prompt Searches for Very-High-Energy {\gamma}-Ray Counterparts to IceCube Astrophysical Neutrino Alerts</title>

Abstract: The search for sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be significantly advanced through a multi-messenger approach, which seeks to detect the gamma rays that accompany neutrinos as they are produced at their sources. Multi-messenger observations have so far provided the first evidence for a neutrino source, illustrated by the joint detection of the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in highenergy (HE, E &gt; 1 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) gamma rays in coincidence with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A, identified by IceCube. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), namely FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, continue to conduct extensive neutrino target-of-opportunity follow-up programs. These programs have two components: followup observations of single astrophysical neutrino candidate events (such as IceCube-170922A), and observation of known gamma-ray sources after the identification of a cluster of neutrino events by IceCube. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of follow-up observations of high-energy neutrino events observed by the four IACTs between September 2017 (after the IceCube-170922A event) and January 2021. Our study found no associations between gamma-ray sources and the observed neutrino events. We provide a detailed overview of each neutrino event and its potential counterparts. Furthermore, a joint analysis of all IACT data is included, yielding combined upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux.</description>

      <title>A Tidal Disruption Event from an Intermediate-mass Black Hole Revealed by Comprehensive Multi-wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star crosses the tidal radius of a black hole (BH) and is ripped apart, providing a novel and powerful way to probe dormant BHs over a wide mass range. In this study, we present our late-time observations and comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses of an extraordinary TDE at the center of a dwarf galaxy, which exhibited successive flares in the optical, X-ray, and radio bands. Notably, we discovered an unexpected high-state X-ray plateau phase following the peak until the present time. Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert. This discovery highlights the invaluable role of TDEs in the search for elusive IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3: A variable petaelectronvolt gamma-ray source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of variable $\gamma$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray binary.The $\gamma$-ray signal was detected with a statistical significance of approximately 10 $\sigma$ by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).Its intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED), extending from 0.06 to 3.7 PeV, shows a pronounced rise toward 1 PeV after accounting for absorption by the cosmic microwave background radiation.The detected month-scale variability,together with a 3.2$\sigma$ evidence for orbital modulation, suggests that the PeV $\gamma$-rays originate within, or in close proximity to, the binary system itself.The observed energy spectrum and temporal modulation can be naturally explained by $\gamma$-ray production through photomeson processes in the innermost region of the relativistic jet, where protons need to be accelerated to tens of PeV energies.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe Discovery of an X-ray Flare from K-type Star PM J23221-0301</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation. This discovery underscores EP's capability in understanding stellar magnetic activity via observing stellar transients.</description>

      <title>Discovery of two new millisecond pulsars towards the Galactic bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mysterious Galactic Center Excess of gamma rays could be explained by a large population of millisecond pulsars hiding in the Galactic bulge, too faint to be detected as individual high-energy point sources by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, as well as too fast and too dispersed to be detected in shallow radio pulsation surveys. Motivated by an innovative candidate selection method, we aim at detecting millisecond pulsars associated with the Galactic Center Excess by carrying deep radio pulsation searches towards promising candidates detected in the inner Galaxy, in X rays by Chandra, and in radio or gamma rays by the Very Large Array or Fermi. We conducted deep radio observation and follow-up campaigns with MeerKAT, the Murriyang and the Green Bank telescopes towards 9 X-ray candidate sources. We here report the detection of two new millisecond pulsars, including a black widow candidate, towards the Galactic bulge: PSRs J1740-2805 and J1740-28. These discoveries double the number of MSPs discovered within the innermost 2 degree from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength identification of millisecond pulsar candidates in the Galactic bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a population of millisecond pulsars in the Galactic bulge is supported, along with other evidence, by the Fermi GeV excess, an anomalous {\gamma}-ray emission detected almost 15 years ago in the direction of the Galactic center. However, radio surveys searching for pulsations have not yet revealed bulge millisecond pulsars. Identifying promising bulge millisecond pulsar candidates is key to motivating pointed radio pulsation searches. Candidates are often selected among steep-spectrum or polarized radio sources, but multiwavelength information can also be exploited: The aim of this work is to pinpoint strong candidates among the yet unidentified X-ray sources. We investigated the multiwavelength counterparts of sources detected by the Chandra X-ray observatory that have spectral properties expected for millisecond pulsars in the Galactic bulge. We considered that ultraviolet, optical, and strong infrared counterparts indicate that an X-ray source is not a bulge pulsar, while a radio or a faint infrared counterpart makes it a promising candidate. We identify a large population of more than a thousand X-ray sources without optical, ultraviolet, or strong infrared counterparts. Among them, five are seen for the first time in unpublished radio imaging data from the Very Large Array. We provide the list of promising candidates, for most of which follow-up pulsation searches are ongoing.</description>

      <title>A finite temperature framework for quark matter with color-superconducting phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current observations of neutron stars and measurements of gravitational waves only provide constraints on the zero temperature ($T=0$) equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. The detection of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary neutron star merger would additionally provide access to finite-temperature properties of the EoS which contain more information about the composition and the interactions of dense matter than the cold EoS alone. In particular deconfined quark matter may be probed by its characteristic finite temperature effects. This is especially the case for color-superconducting phases, in which the quasiparticle contribution to the thermal pressure is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures. Here we develop a new finite $T$ framework to model the thermal EoS for dense quark matter based on the cold quark matter EoS which is useful for numerical relativity simulations. We test the validity of the framework against a three-flavor NJL mean-field calculation, both with and without diquark pairing. We find that even for the complicated phase diagram of the NJL model including multiple different phases the framework is accurate to the few percent level for temperatures up to $T\sim 50\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>BeppoSAX-WFC catalog of fast X-ray transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a search for fast X-ray transients (FXTs), with durations longer than one second and less than one day, through data of the Wide Field Camera (WFC) instrument onboard the BeppoSAX X-ray observatory collected between June 1996 and April 2002. (..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>

      <title>Multiple mountains on a pulsar: implications for gravitational waves and the spin-down rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pulsar, i.e., a spinning neutron star, with a deformation could emit gravitational waves continuously. Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth. In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust. Here, we consider astronomically motivated mountain distributions and use the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity which has three polarization states: two tensors dominated by the time-varying quadrupole moment and one scalar dominated by the time-varying dipole moment. We also give the limiting results for general relativity.</description>

      <title>Nova Explosions in 2040</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novae are thermonuclear explosions on the surface of accreting white dwarfs and are key laboratories for studying explosive nucleosynthesis, particle acceleration, shock physics, and binary evolution. Despite major progress driven by wide-field time-domain surveys and multi-wavelength facilities, our understanding of nova explosions remains limited by incomplete temporal coverage, heterogeneous spectroscopic follow-up, and poorly constrained ejecta properties. In this white paper we outline the open scientific questions that will define nova research in the 2040s, focusing on the mass, composition, geometry, and dynamics of the ejecta, the role of the underlying binary system, and the connection between nuclear burning, shocks, and emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. We argue that decisive progress requires rapid-response, high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations, anchored by systematic high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy from eruption to quiescence. Finally, we identify key technological requirements needed to enable transformative advances in the physics of nova explosions over the coming decades.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion onto compact objects is one of the most fundamental phenomena in the astrophysics, powering some of the most luminous objects in the sky. Along with this, accretion has also a key impact on the evolution of the Universe, through the launch of powerful outflows that affect the surrounding medium. In the last years sub-second optical-infrared observations of accreting X-ray binaries have opened a new window in the study of inflow-outflow connection, discovering a wide range of previously unkown phenomena. Here we review the key open questions in accretion and ejection physics and discuss how a dedicated facility, equipped with photon-counting detectors and high spectral resolution from the UV to the mid-infrared, can enable transformative advances in our understanding of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>GRHayL: a modern, infrastructure-agnostic, extensible library for GRMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting multi-messenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance-computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical-relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable pointwise and stencil-wise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and CarpetX) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron-star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Neutron Stars Produce Diffuse Axion X-Ray Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles can be abundantly produced through scattering processes in the cores of neutron stars (NSs). If they are ultralight ($m_a \lesssim 10^{-4}$ eV), then they can efficiently convert to detectable photons in the external NS magnetospheres, and if they are heavy ($m_a \gtrsim 1$ eV), then they can decay into photons before reaching Earth. In this work, we search for the resulting X-ray signatures from both of these channels summing over the $\textit{cosmological}$ NS population. We compare the predicted axion-induced X-ray signal to the cosmic X-ray background today as measured by a number of instruments such as NuSTAR, HEAO, Swift, and INTEGRAL. We model the axion-induced signal using NS cooling simulations and magnetic field evolution models. We find no evidence for axions and derive strong constraints for both ultralight and heavy axion scenarios, covering new parameter space for the axion-photon and axion-nucleon couplings. Our results rule out the axion-explanation of the Magnificent Seven X-ray excess from nearby isolated NSs.</description>

      <title>Modeling the frequency-domain ringdown amplitude of comparable-mass mergers with greybody factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that, in a binary coalescence, the greybody factor of the remnant black hole modulates the post-merger ringdown signal. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple four-parameter model based on the greybody factor accurately reproduces the frequency-domain amplitude of a large set of comparable-mass, aligned-spin numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, achieving mismatches of order ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and improving existing models by roughly two orders of magnitude. We also identify the optimal initial frequency for applying the model in the frequency domain and provide analytical fits of the model parameters in terms of the progenitor masses and aligned spins. Our results pave the way for new consistency tests of the ringdown phase, complementary to traditional black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Shedding the envelope: JWST reveals a kiloparsec-scale [OIII]-weak Balmer shell around a z=7.64 quasar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous quasars at the redshift frontier z&gt;7 serve as stringent probes of super-massive black hole formation and they are thought to undergo much of their growth obscured by dense gas and dust in their host galaxies. Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313$-$1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known.
  From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=(1.63 \pm 0.10)\times10^9 M_\odot$ based on H$\beta$ and an Eddington rate of $\lambda=L/L_\mathrm{Edd}=0.80\pm 0.05$, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to $\sim 1.8$ kpc traced by H$\beta$ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a $3\sigma$ upper limit on the [O III]$ \lambda$5007 to H$\beta$ flux ratio of $\log_{10} \left( F(\mathrm{[OIII]})/F(\mathrm{H}\beta)\right)=-1.15$.
  Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.</description>

      <title>ASKAP discovery of a 30 kpc bipolar outflow from the edge-on disk of the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 130-G012</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a large-scale, limb-brightened outflow, extending at least 30 kpc above and below the star-forming disk of the edge-on galaxy ESO 130-G012 (D = 16.9 Mpc). Partially obscured by Galactic foreground stars and dust, this optically unremarkable, low-mass galaxy reveals one of the largest known hourglass-shaped outflows from the full extent of its bright stellar disk. The outflow was discovered in 944 MHz radio continuum images from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) obtained as part of the "Evolutionary Map of the Universe" (EMU) project. Its height is at least 3x that of the stellar disk diameter (~10 kpc), while its shape and size most resemble the large biconical, edge-brightened FUV and X-ray outflows in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 3079. The large-scale, hourglass-shaped outflow of ESO 130-G012 appears to be hollow and originates from the star-forming disk, expanding into the halo with speeds close to the escape velocity before likely returning to the disk. Given ESO 130-G012's modest star formation rate, the height of the outflow is surprising and unusual, likely made possible by the galaxy's relatively low gravitational potential. Follow-up observations are expected to detect hot gas inside the bipolar outflow cones and magnetic fields along the X-shaped outflow wings. Neutral gas may also be lifted above the inner disk by the outflow.</description>

Abstract: How a seemingly `dead' host galaxy provides fuel for its active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains an unresolved problem. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we present a new high-sensitivity atomic-hydrogen (HI) observation toward the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 4278 and its adjacent region. From the observation, we found that external gas accretion from a neighbouring galaxy fuels the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278 through tidal interactions. The accreted gas entering NGC 4278 exhibits a rotating gas disk. And the accreted galaxy has been gas-poor and has an HI to stellar mass ratio of about 0.02. Due to the process of gas accretion, it is likely that relativistic jets are generated in the AGN of NGC 4278. The emission of TeV gamma rays in NGC 4278 is likely to be associated with the newly accreted HI gas.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the anomaly in the production of $^{60}$Fe nucleus in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of $^{60}$Fe is crucial for nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. In this work, by using the microscopic EP+IPM (exact pairing plus the independent-particle model) for the nuclear level density (NLD) and extended EP+PDM (exact pairing plus phonon damping model) for the $\gamma$-ray strength function (gSF), we re-evaluate the substantial enhancement of $^{60}$Fe production recently reported in {\it A. Spyrou et al., Nat. Comm. {\bf 15}, 9608 (2024)}, which was attributed to an unexpectedly large Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). Our analysis demonstrates that this enhancement indeed originates from the choice of NLD, which, despite being constrained to reproduce the total NLD and gSF data, lacks a reliable spin dependence, a critical input for Hauser-Feshbach calculations of nuclear reaction rate. In contrast, our predictions yield a significantly lower MACS, calling the claimed enhancement into question. In particular, our approach highlights the microscopic nature of the low-energy enhancement of the gSF, the so-called upbend resonance, which arises from strong particle-particle ($pp$) and hole-hole ($hh$) excitations that emerge only at finite temperature, thereby further reinsisting on the invalidity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis in this low-energy region. Overall, our study reopens the question on the long-standing problem of $^{60}$Fe production in massive stars.</description>

      <title>Expanding Horizons - Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s Time-Domain Multi-Messenger Astronomy in the 2040s: EM Follow-up of LGWA Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coming decades will see gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy expand decisively into the mHz-Hz frequency range, opening access to a population of compact binaries that are currently invisible or only detectable moments before merger. The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) concept is designed to probe this gap, enabling continuous observation of compact binaries over months to years prior to coalescence, and detecting sources inaccessible to both space-based mHz detectors and current ground-based &gt;10 Hz facilities. This new GW window fundamentally alters the landscape of time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>Radio frequency interference identification using eigenvalue decomposition for multi-beam observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the installation of next-generation phased array feed (PAF) receivers on radio telescopes, there is an urgent need to develop effective and computationally efficient radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation methods for large-scale surveys. Here we present a new RFI mitigation package, called mRAID (multi-beam RAdio frequency Interference Detector), which uses the eigenvalue decomposition algorithm to identify RFI in cross-correlation matrix (CCM) of data recorded by multiple beams. When applied to high time-resolution pulsar search data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), mRAID demonstrates excellent performance in identifying RFI over short timescales, thereby enhancing the efficiency of pulsar and fast radio burst (FRB) searches. Since the computation of the CCM and the eigenvalue decomposition for each time sub-integration and frequency channel are independent, the process is fully parallelisable. As a result, mRAID offers a significant computational advantage over commonly used RFI detection methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays propagation using the input from Configuration Interaction Shell Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dipole response of a nuclear system, characterized by its photon strength function (PSF), is a key ingredient of many applications of nuclear structure, ranging from nuclear reactor design and nuclear waste transmutation to astrophysical models of nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. While the majority of those applications require the knowledge of PSF of mid-mass and heavy nuclei, there is now renewed interest in $E1$ strength distributions of light nuclei in the framework of the PANDORA project, which aims at an understanding of the mass distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic radiation (UHECR).UHECR is of extragalactic origin and its interaction along the travel path is dominated by photoabsorption of cosmic background radiation boosted to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) energy region in the center-of-mass system. Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40. Theoretical predictions are compared to available data and to existing predictions from phenomenological and microscopic models. Finally, the impact of using of CI-SM PSF on the predicted propagation of a $^{40}$Ca UHECR source is studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the motion of an electron constrained to follow a magnetic field line near a primordial sub-stellar mass black hole. Earlier studies treated the problem in flat (Minkowski) spacetime, yielding qualitatively correct results and introducing a light cylinder (LC), a hypothetical surface where the linear velocity of rotation equals the speed of light. However, this picture changes significantly when gravity is included. By analyzing the electron's dynamics in the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain a modified light cylinder (MLC) whose geometry no longer resembles a cylinder. We then determine the maximum energies attainable by the electrons under the limiting effects of inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation, and synchrotron radiation.</description>

      <title>High mass accretion rates onto evolved stripped-envelope massive stars by jet-induced mass removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating one-dimensional stellar evolution models with MESA, we show that removing the outer inflated envelope of a mass-accreting evolved stripped-envelope star, like a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, substantially moderates the stellar expansion during accretion at high-mass accretion rates. We study the accretion onto a star via an accretion disk, which launches jets that remove the high-entropy outer layers of the inflated envelope. This is the `jetted mass removal accretion scenario.' By manually removing the entire hydrogen-rich envelope from a red supergiant, we build a hydrogen-deficient WR stellar model with a mass of 6.03Mo and a radius of 0.67Ro. We then accrete mass onto it at a high rate. We mimic the real process of simultaneous mass addition near the equatorial plane and jet-induced mass removal from the outer envelope by dividing the accretion period into hundreds of pulses: in the first half of each pulse, we add mass, and in the second, we remove a fraction of this mass. The removal of tens of percent from the added mass decreases the stellar expansion by a factor of about 2-5. Our results show that WR stars can maintain a deep potential well and not expand much while accreting mass at high rates. This allows the formation of an accretion disk and the liberation of large amounts of gravitational energy. Our results strengthen models of intermediate-luminosity optical transients, such as luminous red novae, in which a non-degenerate star accretes at high rates and launches jets that power the transient event.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nuclear equation of state from terrestrial experiments and neutron star observations using relativistic mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nuclear equation of state (EoS) for isospin-asymmetric matter using a new set of RMF interactions with the $\sigma$-$\delta$ and $\omega$-$\rho$ mixing, referred to as the OMEG family. These interactions are optimized so as to reproduce both terrestrial nuclear measurements and astrophysical constraints extracted from NICER and GW170817. The $\sigma$-$\delta$ mixing softens the nuclear symmetry energy and pressure around twice the saturation density, which enables relatively small neutron-star radii and tidal deformabilities while keeping the nuclear EoS sufficiently stiff at high densities to support $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars. We find that the curvature parameter, $K_{\textrm{sym}}$, plays an important role in realizing the soft-to-hard behavior of the nuclear EoS, and the astrophysical data favor small or even negative values of $K_{\textrm{sym}}$.</description>

      <title>Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new near-infrared time-domain survey instrument installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of the recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 degree-squared field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

      <title>SNR 1987A : Spitzer data from days 6000 to 8000 revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An excess emission has been observed by Spitzer in the [3, 5] micron range of the SNR 1987A spectrum. It is generally argued that this excess could be due to the presence of warm amorphous carbon dust in the equatorial ring (ER) around the supernova, but the proposed models all have problems. This prompted us to present an alternative view on the interpretation of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of SNR 1987A from the near-IR wavelengths to the radio frequencies (from 3 micron up to 1.4 GHz), between 6000 and 8000 days after outburst. We argue that the origin of that excess could be attributed instead to a free-free emission. We show that under very specific conditions (the free-free is self-absorbed at a cut-off frequency imposed by the mass of the emitting region), it could be produced by collisional heating of the gas. We then discuss the time evolution of the various components of the SED. We establish a linear relationship between the growth of the warm carbon dust mass and that of the silicates dust during the analyzed period. Finally, we build the Spitzer light curves and we show that our models reproduce the observations pretty well, although our study clearly favors the free-free case. In conclusion, we argue that the free-free model provides a formally very good description of the data, however the model does require some very specific parameter choices, and results in an unusually low temperature for the ionized gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive parameter-space study of binary black hole (BBH) mergers using the SEOBNRv4\_opt waveform model. Our analysis spans $\sim 10^6$ simulated waveforms across a broad range of mass ratios \( q = \frac{m_1}{m_2} \in [1.0, 2.0] \) and aligned spin configurations. We investigate the influence of these parameters on remnant properties, including final spin ($\chi_f$), fractional mass loss ($M_{\mathrm{FL}}$), and peak gravitational-wave strain ($h_{\max}$). By systematically analyzing the trends across four distinct spin alignments (PP, PN, BP, BN), we identify non-monotonic behaviors and turning points in $M_{\mathrm{FL}}$ and $\chi_f$ as functions of $q$, highlighting subtle dynamical effects that are not explicitly emphasized in commonly used remnant fitting formulae. While confirming known correlations from numerical relativity, our results offer new insights into parameter interactions and waveform morphology, with implications for BBH population studies and remnant characterization. Across all configurations studied, the fractional mass loss due to gravitational-wave emission ranges between 2\% and 9.5\%, depending on the mass ratio and spin alignment. This work may also aid in understanding the spin and mass distributions of the more massive black holes formed post-merger, thereby contributing to future remnant-based astrophysical inference.</description>

      <title>A Spatial Gap in the Sky Distribution of Fast Radio Burst Detections Coinciding with Galactic Plasma Overdensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the positional and morphological properties of about 3600 unique fast radio burst (FRB) sources reported in the second FRB catalog generated by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We find a two-dimensional dependence of FRB detections on sky position, and identify a significant absence of detections in a roughly circular region centered at Galactic coordinates (77.7$^\circ$, 0.9$^\circ$), spanning an area of 213.6 deg$^2$. This detection gap spatially coincides with the Cygnus X region $--$ a plasma-rich star-forming region in the Milky Way. This feature is most likely the result of increased sky temperature and strong multi-path scattering by turbulent ionized plasma, which broadens the FRB signals beyond detectability in the CHIME band. Our simulations yield a mean of 6 expected FRB detections within the gap when accounting for the elevated sky temperature in the direction of the detection gap. We infer that a lower limit of the maximum scattering timescale $\tau_{\rm sc,\, 1\,GHz} \geq 5.59$ ms, obtained without assuming a model of the Galactic electron distribution, is sufficient to suppress the brightness of all coincident FRBs. A similar suppression is seen in Catalog 2 along other high-emission measure (EM) sightlines (i.e., EM$\geq$2900 pc cm$^{-6}$), further supporting a broader trend of suppression due to Galactic scattering. Future very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) measurements of scattering disks with CHIME Outriggers could help confirm our interpretation. Our work highlights the notion that FRBs can serve as new, model-independent tracers of the warm ionized medium within our Milky Way Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</description>

      <title>Lensing by black holes within astrophysical environments</title>

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'', that also arise at the Newtonian and post-Newtonian levels, track the transition scale set by the halo parameters that control the strong-lensing upturn and can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: a fast-evolving Type IIb supernova with a prominent shock-cooling peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric (typically 0.5$\sim$1 day) and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance (11.3$\pm$1.1 Mpc), metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. Nebular spectral modelling indicates a blueshifted O-rich clump moving toward observer, and the $[\text{OI}]/[\text{CaII}]$ line ratio suggests an intermediate-mass progenitor. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with $M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.04\pm{0.01} M_{\odot}$ and a low ejecta mass of$M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 1.55^{+0.18}_{-0.14} M_{\odot}$. And the nebular-phase spectra and light-curve modelling both suggest that it most likely originated from an intermediate-mass binary progenitor system. The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Eclipsing Stellar Flare on the Demon Star Algol Binary System Observed during the MAXI-NICER Follow-up Campaign in 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algol is a well-known eclipsing binary hosting an active and variable star that exhibits frequent stellar flares. Here, we report our pre-planned and coordinated rapid X-ray follow-up observations of an eclipsing flare on Algol. The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2-10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20% level from $1.9\times10^{-10}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\times10^{-11}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45{\deg}S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A. The apparent absorption increase before the eclipse might originate from coronal mass ejection (CME) in the line of sight ejected during the flare.</description>
