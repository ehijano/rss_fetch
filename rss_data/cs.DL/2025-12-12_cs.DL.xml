      <title>BookReconciler: An Open-Source Tool for Metadata Enrichment and Work-Level Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BookReconciler, an open-source tool for enhancing and clustering book data. BookReconciler allows users to take spreadsheets with minimal metadata, such as book title and author, and automatically 1) add authoritative, persistent identifiers like ISBNs 2) and cluster related Expressions and Manifestations of the same Work, e.g., different translations or editions. This enhancement makes it easier to combine related collections and analyze books at scale. The tool is currently designed as an extension for OpenRefine -- a popular software application -- and connects to major bibliographic services including the Library of Congress, VIAF, OCLC, HathiTrust, Google Books, and Wikidata. Our approach prioritizes human judgment. Through an interactive interface, users can manually evaluate matches and define the contours of a Work (e.g., to include translations or not). We evaluate reconciliation performance on datasets of U.S. prize-winning books and contemporary world fiction. BookReconciler achieves near-perfect accuracy for U.S. works but lower performance for global texts, reflecting structural weaknesses in bibliographic infrastructures for non-English and global literature. Overall, BookReconciler supports the reuse of bibliographic data across domains and applications, contributing to ongoing work in digital libraries and digital humanities.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Byline: Exploring Gender and Authorship Patterns in Canadian Science Publishing Journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canada is internationally recognized for its leadership in science and its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. Despite this leadership, limited research has examined gender disparities in scientific publishing within the Canadian context. This study analyzes over 67,000 articles published in 24 Canadian Science Publishing (CSP) journals between 2010 and 2021 to better understand patterns of gender representation. Findings show that women accounted for less than one-third of published authors across CSP journals. Representation varied by discipline, with higher proportions of women in biomedical sciences and lower proportions of women in engineering - trends that mirror broader national and global patterns. Notably, the proportion of women submitting manuscripts closely matched those published, suggesting that broader workforce disparities may play a larger role than publication bias. Women were less likely to be solo authors or to hold prominent authorship positions, such as first or last author - roles typically associated with research leadership and career advancement. These findings point to the need for a two-fold response: continued efforts to address systemic barriers to women's participation in science, and a review of publishing practices to ensure equitable access, recognition, and inclusion for all researchers.</description>

      <title>dtreg: Describing Data Analysis in Machine-Readable Format in Python and R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For scientific knowledge to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, it needs to be machine-readable. Moving forward from post-publication extraction of knowledge, we adopted a pre-publication approach to write research findings in a machine-readable format at early stages of data analysis. For this purpose, we developed the package dtreg in Python and R. Registered and persistently identified data types, aka schemata, which dtreg applies to describe data analysis in a machine-readable format, cover the most widely used statistical tests and machine learning methods. The package supports (i) downloading a relevant schema as a mutable instance of a Python or R class, (ii) populating the instance object with metadata about data analysis, and (iii) converting the object into a lightweight Linked Data format. This paper outlines the background of our approach, explains the code architecture, and illustrates the functionality of dtreg with a machine-readable description of a t-test on Iris Data. We suggest that the dtreg package can enhance the methodological repertoire of researchers aiming to adhere to the FAIR principles.</description>

      <title>Understanding Toxic Interaction Across User and Video Clusters in Social Video Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social video platforms shape how people access information, while recommendation systems can narrow exposure and increase the risk of toxic interaction. Previous research has often examined text or users in isolation, overlooking the structural context in which such toxic interactions occur. Without considering who interacts with whom and around what content, it is difficult to explain why negative expressions cluster within particular communities. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Chinese social video platform Bilibili, incorporating video-level information as the environment for user expression, modeling users and videos in an interaction matrix. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, we perform separate clustering on both sides of the video-user interaction matrix with K-means. Cluster assignments facilitate comparisons of user behavior, including message length, posting frequency, and source (barrage and comment), as well as textual features such as sentiment and toxicity, and video attributes defined by uploaders. Such a clustering approach integrates structural ties with content signals to identify stable groups of videos and users. We find clear stratification in interaction style (message length, comment ratio) across user clusters, while sentiment and toxicity differences are weak or inconsistent across video clusters. Across video clusters, viewing volume exhibits a clear hierarchy, with higher exposure groups concentrating more toxic expressions. For such a group, platforms should require timely intervention during periods of rapid growth. Across user clusters, comment ratio and message length form distinct hierarchies, and several clusters with longer and comment-oriented messages exhibit lower toxicity. For such groups, platforms should strengthen mechanisms that sustain rational dialogue and encourage engagement across topics.</description>

      <title>The Circulate and Recapture Dynamic of Fan Mobility in Agency-Affiliated VTuber Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VTuber agencies -- multichannel networks (MCNs) that bundle Virtual YouTubers (VTubers) on YouTube -- curate portfolios of channels and coordinate programming, cross appearances, and branding in the live-streaming VTuber ecosystem. It remains unclear whether affiliation binds fans to a single channel or instead encourages movement within a portfolio that buffers exit, and how these micro level dynamics relate to meso level audience overlap. This study examines how affiliation shapes short horizon viewer trajectories and the organization of audience overlap networks by contrasting agency affiliated and independent VTubers. Using a large, multiyear, fan centered panel of VTuber live stream engagement on YouTube, we construct monthly audience overlap between creators with a similarity measure that is robust to audience size asymmetries. At the micro level, we track retention, changes in the primary creator watched (oshi), and inactivity; at the meso level, we compare structural properties of affiliation specific subgraphs and visualize viewer state transitions. The analysis identifies a pattern of loose mobility: fans tend to remain active while reallocating attention within the same affiliation type, with limited leakage across affiliation type. Network results indicate convergence in global overlap while local neighborhoods within affiliated subgraphs remain persistently denser. Flow diagrams reveal circulate and recapture dynamics that stabilize participation without relying on single channel lock in. We contribute a reusable measurement framework for VTuber live streaming that links micro level trajectories to meso level organization and informs research on creator labor, influencer marketing, and platform governance on video platforms. We do not claim causal effects; the observed regularities are consistent with proximity engineered by VTuber agencies and coordinated recapture.</description>
