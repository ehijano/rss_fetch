      <title>Tight Bounds for the Number of Absent Scattered Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scattered factor of a word $w$ is a word $u$ that can be obtained by deleting arbitary letters from $w$ and keep the order of the remaining. Barker et al. introduced the notion of $k$-universality, calling a word $k$-universal, if it contains all possible words of length $k$ over a given alphabet $\Sigma$ as a scattered factor. Kosche et al. introduced the notion of absent scattered factors to categorise the words not being scattered factors of a given word.
  In this paper, we investigate tight bounds on the possible number of absent scattered factors of a given length $k$ (also strictly longer than the shortest absent scattered factors) among all words with the same universality extending the results of Kosche et al. Specifically, given a length $k$ and universality index $\iota$, we characterize $\iota$-universal words with both the maximal and minimal number of absent scattered factors of length $k$. For the lower bound, we provide the exact number in a closed form. For the upper bound, we offer efficient algorithms to compute the number based on the constructed words. Moreover, by combining old results, we present an enumeration with constant delay of the set of scattered factors of a fixed length in time $O(|\Sigma||w|)$.</description>

      <title>The Algebras for Automatic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce "synchronous algebras", an algebraic structure tailored to recognize automatic relations (aka. synchronous relations, or regular relations). They are the equivalent of monoids for regular languages, however they conceptually differ in two points: first, they are typed and second, they are equipped with a dependency relation expressing constraints between elements of different types.
  The interest of the proposed definition is that it allows to lift, in an effective way, pseudovarieties of regular languages to that of synchronous relations, and we show how algebraic characterizations of pseudovarieties of regular languages can be lifted to the pseudovarieties of synchronous relations that they induce. A typical example of such a pseudovariety is the class of "group relations", defined as the relations recognized by finite-state synchronous permutation automata.
  In order to prove this result, we adapt two pillars of algebraic language to synchronous algebras: (a) any relation admits a syntactic synchronous algebra recognizing it, and moreover, the relation is synchronous if, and only if, its syntactic algebra is finite and (b) classes of synchronous relations with desirable closure properties (i.e. pseudovarieties) correspond to pseudovarieties of synchronous algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantum B\"uchi Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.08982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum finite automata (QFAs) have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we define and systematically study quantum B\"uchi automata (QBAs) over infinite words to model the long-term behavior of quantum systems, which extend QFAs. We introduce the classes of $\omega$-languages recognized by QBAs in probable, almost sure, strict and non-strict threshold semantics. Several pumping lemmas and closure properties for QBAs are proved. Some decision problems for QBAs are investigated. In particular, we show that there are surprisingly only at most four substantially different classes of $\omega$-languages recognized by QBAs (out of uncountably infinite). The relationship between classical $\omega$-languages and QBAs is clarified using our pumping lemmas. We also find an $\omega$-language recognized by QBAs under the almost sure semantics, which is not $\omega$-context-free.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy for certain automorphisms of the one-sided shift via transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the following open problem, implicit in the 1990 article "Automorphisms of one-sided subshifts of finite type" of Boyle, Franks and Kitchens (BFK):
  "Does there exists an element $\psi$ in the group of automorphisms of the one-sided shift $\operatorname{Aut}(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n})$ so that all points of $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ have orbits of length $n$ under $\psi$ and $\psi$ is not conjugate to a permutation?"
  Here, by a 'permutation' we mean an automorphism of one-sided shift dynamical system induced by a permutation of the symbol set $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
  We resolve this question by showing that any $\psi$ with properties as above must be conjugate to a permutation.
  Our techniques naturally extend those of BFK using the strongly synchronizing automata technology developed here and in several articles of the authors and collaborators (although, this article has been written to be largely self-contained).</description>
