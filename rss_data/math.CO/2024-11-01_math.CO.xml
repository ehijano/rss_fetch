      <title>Symmetric Domino Tilings of Aztec Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give inductive sum formulas to calculate the number of diagonally symmetric, and diagonally \&amp; anti-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of Aztec Diamonds. As a byproduct, we also find such a formula for the unrestricted case as well. Our proofs rely on a new technique for counting the number of perfect matchings of graphs, proposed by the authors recently.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a class of Farey graphs introduced by the final three authors to enumerate the tame friezes over $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Using the same strategy we enumerate the tame regular friezes over $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, thereby reproving a recent result of B\"ohmler, Cuntz, and Mabilat.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed cycles up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and reconstruction in matroids of highly connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph matroid family $\mathcal{M}$ is a family of matroids $\mathcal{M}(G)$ defined on the edge set of each finite graph $G$ in a compatible and isomorphism-invariant way. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ has the Whitney property if there is a constant $c$ such that every $c$-connected graph $G$ is uniquely determined by $\mathcal{M}(G)$. Similarly, $\mathcal{M}$ has the Lov\'asz-Yemini property if there is a constant $c$ such that for every $c$-connected graph $G$, $\mathcal{M}(G)$ has maximal rank among graphs on the same number of vertices.
  We show that if $\mathcal{M}$ is unbounded (that is, there is no absolute constant bounding the rank of $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for every $G$), then $\mathcal{M}$ has the Whitney property if and only if it has the Lov\'asz-Yemini property. We also give a complete characterization of these properties in the bounded case. As an application, we show that if some graph matroid families have the Whitney property, then so does their union. Finally, we show that every $1$-extendable graph matroid family has the Lov\'asz-Yemini (and thus the Whitney) property. These results unify and extend a number of earlier results about graph reconstruction from an underlying matroid.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial connections in snake graphs: Tilings, lattice paths, and perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the combinatorial structures underlying snake graphs, focusing on their connections to domino tilings, lattice paths, and perfect matchings. By exploring the structure of snake graphs and their associated regions, we introduce triangular snake graphs (connected acyclic directed graphs) and provide a bijection between their routes (non-intersecting lattice paths), perfect matchings of their underlying snake graphs, and tilings, revealing significant relationships and identities.
  Furthermore, we study the algebraic implications of these combinatorial structures. We show how the number of perfect matchings in snake graphs can be expressed in terms of determinants of Hankel matrices or path matrices associated with Catalan, Fibonacci, and Pell numbers. This provides a novel perspective on the interplay between combinatorial objects and algebraic identities.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial extension of tropical cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses a combinatorial extension of tropical intersection theory to spaces given by glueing quotients of partially open convex polyhedral cones by finitely many automorphisms. This extension is done in terms of linear poic-complexes and poic-fibrations, mainly motivated by the case of the moduli spaces of tropical curves of arbitrary genus and marking. We define tropical cycles of a linear poic-complex and of a poic-fibration, and discuss the pushforward maps in these situations. In the context of moduli spaces of tropical curves, we also discuss "clutching morphisms" and "forgetting the marking" morphisms. In a subsequent article we apply this framework to moduli spaces of discrete admissible covers and study the loci of tropical curves that appear as the source of a degree-$d$ discrete admissible cover of a genus-$h$ $m$-marked tropical curve, for fixed $d$, $h$ and $m$.</description>

      <title>Blow-ups and extensions of trees in tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of acyclic digraphs $\mathscr{C}$ is linearly unavoidable if there exists a constant $c$ such that every digraph $D\in \mathscr{C}$ is contained in all tournaments of order $c\cdot |V(D)|$. The class of all acyclic digraphs is not linearly avoidable, and Fox, He, and Widgerson recently showed that this is not even the case for acyclic digraphs with bounded maximum degree. On the positive side, Thomason and H\"aggkvist proved that the class of oriented trees is linearly unavoidable. In this work, we generalize this result to acyclic digraphs obtained from an oriented tree by adding at most $k$ vertices, and $k$-blow-ups of oriented trees, for every fixed integer $k$.
  More precisely, we show that if $D$ is obtained from an oriented tree $F$ of order $n$ by adding $k$ universal vertices, then $D$ is contained in every tournament of order $2\cdot 3^{(k+1)(2k+1)} \cdot n$; and if $D$ is obtained from $F$ by replacing each vertex $u$ by an independent set $X_u$ of size $k$ and every arc $uv$ by all possible arcs from $X_u$ to $X_v$, then $D$ is contained in every tournament of order $2^{10+18k}k \cdot n$.</description>

      <title>Focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of a variant of sunflowers, Alon and Holzman recently introduced focal-free hypergraphs. In this paper, we show that there is an interesting connection between the maximum size of focal-free hypergraphs and the renowned Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture on the maximum number of edges that can be contained in a uniform hypergraph with bounded matching number. As a consequence, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on the maximum sizes of focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes, thereby significantly improving the previous results of Alon and Holzman. Moreover, by using the existentce results of combinatorial designs and orthogonal arrays, we are able to explicitly determine the exact sizes of maximum focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes for a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Existence of magic rectangle sets over finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be positive integers. Let $(G,+)$ be a finite abelian group of order $abc$. A $G$-magic rectangle set MRS$_G(a,b;c)$ is a collection of $c$ arrays of size $a\times b$ whose entries are elements of a group $G$, each appearing exactly once, such that the sum of each row in every array equals a constant $\gamma\in G$ and the sum of each column in every array equals a constant $\delta\in G$. This paper establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an MRS$_G(a,b;c)$ for any finite abelian group $G$, thereby confirming a conjecture presented by Cichacz and Hinc.</description>

      <title>The minimum size of a $3$-connected locally nonforesty graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A local subgraph of a graph is the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of a vertex. Thus a graph of order $n$ has $n$ local subgraphs. A graph $G$ is called locally nonforesty if every local subgraph of $G$ contains a cycle. Recently, in studying forest cuts of a graph, Chernyshev, Rauch and Rautenbach posed the conjecture that if $n$ and $m$ are the order and size of a $3$-connected locally nonforesty graph respectively, then $m\ge 7(n-1)/3.$ We solve this problem by determining the minimum size of a $3$-connected locally nonforesty graph of order $n.$ It turns out that the conjecture does not hold.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with full difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of a finite set, define $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})=\{F\setminus F': F, F'\in\mathcal{F}\}$. A family $\mathcal{F}$ is called intersecting if $F\cap F'\not=\emptyset$ for all $F, F'\in\mathcal{F}$. Frankl \cite{Frankl} showed that for a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ with $n\ge k(k+3)$, $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})|$ reaches the maximum if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $k$-uniform full star. Later, Frankl-Kiselev-Kupavskii \cite{FKK} improved the bound $n\ge k(k+3)$ in the above result of Frankl \cite{Frankl} to $n\ge 50klnk$ for $k\ge 50$. For $2k&lt;n&lt;4k$, Frankl-Kiselev-Kupavskii \cite{FKK} showed that there exists a $k$-uniform family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ such that $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})|$ is larger than $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})|$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a full star. This result left the case $n=2k$ open and we show that $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ can be `full' for some $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$. It is clear that for an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$, $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})\subseteq \cup_{j=0}^{k-1}{[n]\choose j}$. We say that a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ has full differences if $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})=\cup_{j=0}^{k-1}{[n]\choose j}$. For odd $k$, Frankl \cite{Frankl} gave a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences of size $k-1$, and he asked for even $k\ge 4$ whether there exists a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences of size $k-1$. We answer this question in a stronger form and show that for even $k\ge 4$, there exists a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bounded measurable set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ we denote the Lebesgue measure of $\{(x, y)\in A^2\colon x\le y\le x+1\}$ by $\Phi(A)$. We prove that if $I=A_1\cup\dots\cup A_{k+1}$ partitions an interval $I$ of length $L$ into $k+1$ measurable pieces, then $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \Phi(A_i)\ge (\sqrt{k^2+1}-k)L-1$, where the multiplicative constant $\sqrt{k^2+1}-k$ is optimal. As a matter of fact we obtain the more general result that $\Phi(A)\ge (\xi+\sqrt{1-2\xi+2\xi^2}-1)L-1$ whenever $A\subseteq I$ has measure $\xi L$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel definition of hypergraphical matroids, defined for arbitrary hypergraphs, simultaneously generalizing previous definitions for regular hypergraphs (Main, 1978), and for the hypergraphs of circuits of a matroid (Freij-Hollanti, Jurrius, Kuznetsova, 2023). As a consequence, we obtain a new notion of cycles in hypergraphs, and hypertrees. We give an equivalence relation on hypergraphs, according to when their so-called matroidal closures agree. Finally, we characterize hypergraphs that are isomorphic to the circuit hypergraphs of the associated matroids.</description>

      <title>Partial Algebraic Shifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algebraic shifting of uniform hypergraphs and finite simplicial complexes in the exterior algebra with respect to matrices which are not necessarily generic. Several questions raised by Kalai (2002) are addressed. For instance, it turns out that the combinatorial shifting of Erd\H{o}s$\unicode{x2013}$Ko$\unicode{x2013}$Rado (1961) arises as a special case. Moreover, we identify a sufficient condition for partial shifting to preserve the Betti numbers of a simplicial complex; examples show that this condition is sharp.</description>

Abstract: The $r$-bond bootstrap percolation process on a graph $G$ begins with a set $S$ of infected edges of $G$ (all other edges are healthy). At each step, a healthy edge becomes infected if at least one of its endpoints is incident with at least $r$ infected edges (and it remains infected). If $S$ eventually infects all of $E(G)$, we say $S$ percolates. In this paper we provide recursive formulae for the minimum size of percolating sets in several large families of graphs. We utilise an algebraic method introduced by Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Qian, and substantially extend and generalise their work.</description>

      <title>Counting the fission trees and nonabelian Hodge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any algebraic connection on a vector bundle on a smooth complex algebraic curve determines an irregular class and in turn a fission tree at each puncture. The fission trees are the discrete data classifying the admissible deformation classes. Here we explain how to count the fission trees with given slope and number of leaves, in the untwisted case. This also leads to a clearer picture of the ``periodic table'' of the atoms that play the role of building blocks in 2d gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Flipping Non-Crossing Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a set $P$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane, the flip graph $F(P)$ has a vertex for each non-crossing spanning tree on $P$ and an edge between any two spanning trees that can be transformed into each other by one edge flip. The diameter ${\rm diam}(F(P))$ of this graph is subject of intensive study. For points in general position, it is between $3n/2-5$ and $2n-4$, with no improvement for 25 years. For points in convex position, it lies between $3n/2 - 5$ and $\approx1.95n$, where the lower bound was conjectured to be tight up to an additive constant and the upper bound is a recent breakthrough improvement over several bounds of the form $2n-o(n)$.
  In this work, we provide new upper and lower bounds on ${\rm diam}(F(P))$, mainly focusing on points in convex position. We show $14n/9 - O(1) \le {\rm diam}(F(P)) \le 5n/3 - 3$, by this disproving the conjectured upper bound of $3n/2$ for convex position, and relevantly improving both the long-standing lower bound for general position and the recent new upper bound for convex position. We complement these by showing that if one of $T,T'$ has at most two boundary edges, then ${\rm dist}(T,T') \le 2d/2 &lt; 3n/2$, where $d = |T-T'|$ is the number of edges in one tree that are not in the other.
  To prove both the upper and the lower bound, we introduce a new powerful tool. Specifically, we convert the flip distance problem for given $T,T'$ to the problem of a largest acyclic subset in an associated conflict graph $H(T,T')$. In fact, this method is powerful enough to give an equivalent formulation of the diameter of $F(P)$ for points $P$ in convex position up to lower-order terms. As such, conflict graphs are likely the key to a complete resolution of this and possibly also other reconfiguration problems.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Near-Additive Spanners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $(\alpha,\beta)$-spanner of a weighted graph $G=(V,E)$, is a subgraph $H$ such that for every $u,v\in V$, $d_G(u,v) \le d_H(u,v)\le\alpha\cdot d_G(u,v)+\beta$. The main parameters of interest for spanners are their size (number of edges) and their lightness (the ratio between the total weight of $H$ to the weight of a minimum spanning tree).
  In this paper we focus on near-additive spanners, where $\alpha=1+\varepsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We show the first construction of {\em light} spanners in this setting. Specifically, for any integer parameter $k\ge 1$, we obtain an $(1+\varepsilon,O(k/\varepsilon)^k\cdot W(\cdot,\cdot))$-spanner with lightness $\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ (where $W(\cdot,\cdot)$ indicates for every pair $u, v \in V$ the heaviest edge in some shortest path between $u,v$). In addition, we can also bound the number of edges in our spanner by $O(kn^{1+3/k})$.</description>

      <title>If parallel lines could meet: What exactly can a poet say about the Fano plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes our invention of a new poetic form based on projective geometry. In doing this we also explore the 'what ifs' in mathematics and poetry which spark the creative processes of poet and mathematician. In other words, throughout our collaboration we often asked one another, is this what it's like for you? Do you think in this way, too? How does your experience of creativity compare to mine? And often, as well, what exactly do you mean when you say...? We spent a fair amount of time and energy, for example, trying to understand one another's interpretation of 'a line'. This collaboration resulted in three poems in the new projective plane form. We also consider what might be interesting avenues for future research, such as the incorporation of octonions in poetic form.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic discrepancy of $m \times m$ matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ belonging to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, which is a class of random symmetric matrices with independent normally distributed entries. In the setting $m^2 = o(n)$, our results show that there exists a signing $x \in \{\pm1\}^n$ such that the spectral norm of $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{nm}4^{-(1 + o(1))n/m^2})$ with high probability. This is best possible and settles a recent conjecture by Kunisky and Zhang.</description>

Abstract: Given an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is at most $n$. This paper addresses the following question: How closely can we approximate $b$ with $Ay$, where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution constrained to have at most $k$ non-zero components with $k&lt;n$? We establish upper and lower bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds match. The key finding is that the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$.</description>

      <title>On fractal patterns in Ulam words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ulam words are binary words defined recursively as follows: the length-$1$ Ulam words are $0$ and $1$, and a binary word of length $n$ is Ulam if and only if it is expressible uniquely as a concatenation of two shorter, distinct Ulam words. We discover, fully describe, and prove a surprisingly rich structure already in the set of Ulam words containing exactly two $1$'s. In particular, this leads to a complete description of such words and a logarithmic-time algorithm to determine whether a binary word with two $1$'s is Ulam. Along the way, we uncover delicate parity and biperiodicity properties, as well as sharp bounds on the number of $0$'s outside the two $1$'s. We also show that sets of Ulam words indexed by the number $y$ of $0$'s between the two $1$'s have intricate tensor-based hierarchical structures determined by the arithmetic properties of $y$. This allows us to construct an infinite family of self-similar Ulam-word-based fractals indexed by the set of $2$-adic integers, containing the outward Sierpinski gasket as a special case.</description>

      <title>Extremal bounds for pattern avoidance in multidimensional 0-1 matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 0-1 matrix $M$ contains another 0-1 matrix $P$ if some submatrix of $M$ can be turned into $P$ by changing any number of $1$-entries to $0$-entries. $M$ is $\mathcal{P}$-saturated where $\mathcal{P}$ is a family of 0-1 matrices if $M$ avoids every element of $\mathcal{P}$ and changing any $0$-entry of $M$ to a $1$-entry introduces a copy of some element of $\mathcal{P}$. The extremal function $\operatorname{ex}(n,\mathcal{P})$ and saturation function $\operatorname{sat}(n,\mathcal{P})$ are the maximum and minimum possible weight of an $n\times n$ $\mathcal{P}$-saturated 0-1 matrix, respectively, and the semisaturation function $\operatorname{ssat}(n,P)$ is the minimum possible weight of an $n\times n$ $\mathcal{P}$-semisaturated 0-1 matrix $M$, i.e., changing any $0$-entry in $M$ to a $1$-entry introduces a new copy of some element of $\mathcal{P}$.
  We give upper bounds on parameters of minimally non-$O(n^{d-1})$ $d$-dimensional 0-1 matrices, generalized from minimally nonlinear 0-1 matrices in two dimensions, and we show the existence of infinitely many minimally non-$O(n^{d-1})$ $d$-dimensional 0-1 matrices with all dimensions of length greater than $1$. For any positive integers $k,d$ and integer $r\in[0,d-1]$, we construct a family of $d$-dimensional 0-1 matrices with both extremal function and saturation function exactly $kn^r$ for sufficiently large $n$. We show that no family of $d$-dimensional 0-1 matrices has saturation function strictly between $O(1)$ and $\Theta(n)$ and we construct a family of $d$-dimensional 0-1 matrices with bounded saturation function and extremal function $\Omega(n^{d-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. Up to a constant multiplicative factor, we fully settle the problem of characterizing the semisaturation function of families of $d$-dimensional 0-1 matrices, which we prove to always be $\Theta(n^r)$ for some integer $r\in[0,d-1]$.</description>

Abstract: Given a rational polytope $P \subset \mathbb R^d$, the numerical function counting lattice points in the integral dilations of $P$ is known to become a quasi-polynomial, called the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial $\mathrm{ehr}_P$ of $P$. In this paper we study the following problem: Given a rational $d$-polytope $P \subset \mathbb R^d$, is there a nice way to know Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of translated polytopes $P+ \mathbf v$ for all $\mathbf v \in \mathbb Q^d$? We provide a way to compute such Ehrhart quasi-polynomials using a certain toric arrangement and lattice point counting functions of translated cones of $P$. This method allows us to visualize how constituent polynomials of $\mathrm{ehr}_{P+\mathbf v}$ change in the torus $\mathbb R^d/\mathbb Z^d$. We also prove that information of $\mathrm{ehr}_{P+\mathbf v}$ for all $\mathbf v \in \mathbb Q^d$ determines the rational $d$-polytope $P \subset \mathbb R^d$ up to translations by integer vectors, and characterize all rational $d$-polytopes $P \subset \mathbb R^d$ such that $\mathrm{ehr}_{P+\mathbf v}$ is symmetric for all $\mathbf v \in \mathbb Q^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the dominance complex $\mathcal{D}(G)$ of a graph $G$ coincides with the combinatorial Alexander dual of the neighborhood complex $\mathcal{N}(\overline{G})$ of the complement of $G$. Using this, we obtain a relation between the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of $G$ and the homology group of $\mathcal{D}(G)$. We also obtain several known results related to dominance complexes from well-known facts of neighborhood complexes. After that, we suggest a new method for computing the homology groups of the dominance complexes, using independence complexes of simple graphs. We show that several known computations of homology groups of dominance complexes can be reduced to known computations of independence complexes. Finally, we determine the homology group of $\mathcal{D}(P_n \times P_3)$ by determining the homotopy types of the independence complex of $P_n \times P_3 \times P_2$.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of tropical Fermat-Weber points in terms of the symmetric tropical metric over the tropical projective torus. It is well-known that a tropical Fermat-Weber point of a given sample is not unique and we show that the set of all possible Fermat-Weber points forms a polytrope. To prove this, we show that the tropical Fermat-Weber polytrope is a bounded cell of a tropical hyperplane arrangement given by both max- and min-tropical hyperplanes with apices given by the sample. We also define tropical Fermat-Weber gradients and provide a gradient descent algorithm that converges to the Fermat-Weber polytrope.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, examining their realization spaces, closures, and associated matroid and circuit varieties. We establish sufficient conditions for both the realizability of these matroids and the irreducibility of their associated varieties. Additionally, we analyze the defining polynomial equations of these varieties using Grassmann-Cayley algebra and geometric liftability techniques. For several families within these matroid types, we provide a complete set of defining equations for matroid varieties, or equivalently, a finite generating set for their associated matroid ideals. This includes forest configurations, and a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, which may have arbitrary rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem from 1974 shows that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $2n/5$ must be bipartite. Its extensions to $3$-uniform hypergraphs without the generalized triangle $F_5 = \{abc, abd, cde\}$ have been explored in several previous works such as~\cite{LMR23unif,HLZ24}, demonstrating the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that for large $n$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(1/9-\varepsilon) n^2$ must be $3$-partite.
  We determine the optimal value for $\varepsilon$ by showing that for $n \ge 5000$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite, thus establishing the first tight Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorem for hypergraphs. As a corollary, for all positive $n$, every $n$-vertex cancellative $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite. This result is also optimal and considerably strengthens prior work, such as that by Bollob\'{a}s~\cite{Bol74} and Keevash--Mubayi~\cite{KM04Cancel}.</description>

      <title>Marstrand type slicing statements in $\mathbb{Z}^{2}\subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ are false for the counting dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for $1$ separated subsets of $\R^{2}$, the natural Marstrand type slicing statements are false with the counting dimension that was used earlier by Moreira and Lima and variants of which were introduced earlier in different contexts. We construct a $1$ separated subset $E$ of the plane which has counting dimension $1$, while for a positive Lebesgue measure parameter set of tubes of width $1$, the intersection of the tube with the set $E$ has counting dimension $1$. This is in contrast to the behavior of such sets with the mass dimension where the slicing theorems hold true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained introduction to the theory of chip-firing games on metric graphs, as well as the more recent theory of tropical Prym varieties.

      <title>Lattice operads and operad filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the notion of a filtration of an operad defined in terms of a lattice-valued operad serving as an indexing object. That covers ordinary integer-indexed filtrations of associative algebras and operads as a special case, yet the notion appears to be natural enough to encompass examples of other kind as well. The characteristic property of lattice operads is that of a certain distributivity of partial compositions with respect to meets and joins. We observe that some well-known families of lattices of combinatorial origin, such as Tamari lattices, assemble to operads subject to this particular property. Other examples include an operad of integer paritions supported on Young's lattice, operads of integer compositions of types $A, B$ and $D$, which we relate to operads of regular polytopes. We discuss the partial compatibility of the weak order on the symmetric group with the structure of the permutations operad.</description>

      <title>Game Connectivity and Adaptive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the typical structure of games in terms of the connectivity properties of their best-response graphs. Our central result shows that almost every game that is 'generic' (without indifferences) and has a pure Nash equilibrium and a 'large' number of players is connected, meaning that every action profile that is not a pure Nash equilibrium can reach every pure Nash equilibrium via best-response paths. This has important implications for dynamics in games. In particular, we show that there are simple, uncoupled, adaptive dynamics for which period-by-period play converges almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in almost every large generic game that has one (which contrasts with the known fact that there is no such dynamic that leads almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in every generic game that has one). We build on recent results in probabilistic combinatorics for our characterisation of game connectivity.</description>

      <title>Highest Weight Varieties and Narayana Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this exposition, we compute the hilbert series of the coordinate ring of some highest weight varieties. We also explain why Narayana numbers (and their generalizations) appear naturally in the numerator of the hilbert series of the coordinate ring of complex grassmanian Gr(d,n+d+1) and of the minimal nilpotent adjoint orbit in sl_n(C). These calculations might be related to some cluster algebra structures.</description>

      <title>Self-Labeling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a self-supervised training strategy designed for combinatorial problems. An obstacle in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the need for costly target solutions often produced with exact solvers. Inspired by semi- and self-supervised learning, we show that generative models can be trained by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, eliminating the need for optimality information. We validate this Self-Labeling Improvement Method (SLIM) on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the neural combinatorial community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with SLIM. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and state-of-the-art learning proposals for the JSP. Lastly, we prove the robustness of SLIM to various parameters and its generality by applying it to the Traveling Salesman Problem.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular resolutions of powers of matching field ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>

      <title>On disjunction convex hulls by lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the natural extended-variable formulation for the disjunction of $n+1$ polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We demonstrate that the convex hull $D$ in the natural extended-variable space $\mathbb{R}^{d+n}$ is given by full optimal big-M lifting (i) when $d\leq 2$ (and that it is not generally true for $d\geq 3$), and also (ii) under some technical conditions, when the polytopes have a common facet-describing constraint matrix, for arbitrary $d\geq 1$ and $n\geq 1$. We give a broad family of examples with $d\geq 3$ and $n=1$, where the convex hull is not described after employing all full optimal big-M lifting inequalities, but it is described after one round of MIR inequalities. Additionally, we give some general results on the polyhedral structure of $D$, and we demonstrate that all facets of $D$ can be enumerated in polynomial time when $d$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>Artin Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct an algebraic invariant attached to Galois representations over number fields. This invariant, which we call an Artin symmetric function, lives in a certain ring we introduce called the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions. This ring is built from a family of symmetric functions rings indexed by prime ideals of the base field. We prove many necessary basic results for the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions as well as introduce the analogues of some standard number-theoretic objects in this setting. We prove that the Artin symmetric functions satisfy the same algebraic properties that the Artin L-functions do with respect to induction, inflation, and direct summation of representations. The expansion coefficients of these symmetric functions in different natural bases are shown to be character values of representations of a compact group related to the original Galois group. In the most interesting case, the expansion coefficients into a specialized Hall-Littlewood basis come from new representations built from the original Galois representation using polynomial functors corresponding to modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Using a special case of the Satake isomorphism in type GL, as formulated by Macdonald, we show that the Artin symmetric functions yield families of functions in the (finite) global spherical Hecke algebras in type GL which exhibit natural stability properties. We compute the Mellin transforms of these functions and relate them to infinite products of shifted Artin L-functions. We then prove some analytic properties of these Dirichlet series and give an explicit expansion of these series using the Hall-Littlewood polynomial functors.</description>
