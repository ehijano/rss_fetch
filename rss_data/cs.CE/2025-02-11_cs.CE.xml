      <title>Using Large Language Models for Solving Thermodynamic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in reasoning, demonstrating their capability to generate human-like responses. This study analyzes the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in the domain of thermodynamics. A benchmark of 22 thermodynamic problems to evaluate LLMs is presented that contains both simple and advanced problems. Five different LLMs are assessed: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o from OpenAI, Llama 3.1 from Meta, and le Chat from MistralAI. The answers of these LLMs were evaluated by trained human experts, following a methodology akin to the grading of academic exam responses. The scores and the consistency of the answers are discussed, together with the analytical skills of the LLMs. Both strengths and weaknesses of the LLMs become evident. They generally yield good results for the simple problems, but also limitations become clear: The LLMs do not provide consistent results, they often fail to fully comprehend the context and make wrong assumptions. Given the complexity and domain-specific nature of the problems, the statistical language modeling approach of the LLMs struggles with the accurate interpretation and the required reasoning. The present results highlight the need for more systematic integration of thermodynamic knowledge with LLMs, for example, by using knowledge-based methods.</description>

      <title>XNet-Enhanced Deep BSDE Method and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) challenges traditional numerical methods due to the "curse of dimensionality." Deep learning, particularly through the Deep BSDE method, offers a promising alternative by leveraging neural networks' capability to approximate high-dimensional functions. This paper introduces a novel network architecture, XNet, which significantly enhances the computational efficiency and accuracy of the Deep BSDE method. XNet demonstrates superior approximation capabilities with fewer parameters, addressing the trade-off between approximation and optimization errors found in existing methods. We detail the implementation of XNet within the Deep BSDE framework and present results that show marked improvements in solving high-dimensional PDEs, potentially setting a new standard for such computations.</description>

      <title>FinMamba: Market-Aware Graph Enhanced Multi-Level Mamba for Stock Movement Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, combining stock features with inter-stock correlations has become a common and effective approach for stock movement prediction. However, financial data presents significant challenges due to its low signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic complexity of the market, which give rise to two key limitations in existing methods. First, the relationships between stocks are highly influenced by multifaceted factors including macroeconomic market dynamics, and current models fail to adaptively capture these evolving interactions under specific market conditions. Second, for the accuracy and timeliness required by real-world trading, existing financial data mining methods struggle to extract beneficial pattern-oriented dependencies from long historical data while maintaining high efficiency and low memory consumption. To address the limitations, we propose FinMamba, a Mamba-GNN-based framework for market-aware and multi-level hybrid stock movement prediction. Specifically, we devise a dynamic graph to learn the changing representations of inter-stock relationships by integrating a pruning module that adapts to market trends. Afterward, with a selective mechanism, the multi-level Mamba discards irrelevant information and resets states to skillfully recall historical patterns across multiple time scales with linear time costs, which are then jointly optimized for reliable prediction. Extensive experiments on U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FinMamba, achieving state-of-the-art prediction accuracy and trading profitability, while maintaining low computational complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/FinMamba.</description>

      <title>Modelling hydrogen integration in energy system models: Best practices for policy insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of hydrogen in long-term energy strategies requires a broad understanding on how hydrogen is currently modelled in national energy system models. This study provides a review on hydrogen representation within selected energy system models that are tailored towards providing policy insights. The paper adopts a multi-layered review approach and selects eleven notable models for the review. The review covers hydrogen production, storage, transportation, trade, demand, modeling strategies, and hydrogen policies. The review suggests existing models would often opt for a simplified representation that can capture each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This approach allows models to strike a balance between accuracy and preserving computational resources. The paper provides several suggestions for modeling hydrogen in national energy system models.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems Applied to tasks in Financial Services: Modeling and model risk management crews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models has ushered in a new era of agentic systems, where artificial intelligence programs exhibit remarkable autonomous decision-making capabilities across diverse domains. This paper explores agentic system workflows in the financial services industry. In particular, we build agentic crews that can effectively collaborate to perform complex modeling and model risk management (MRM) tasks. The modeling crew consists of a manager and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation. The MRM crew consists of a manager along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of modeling and MRM crews by presenting a series of numerical examples applied to credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling datasets.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Additive Manufacturing as a Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global manufacturing landscape is undergoing a fundamental shift from resource-intensive mass production to sustainable, localised manufacturing. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a Cloud Crafting Platform that enables Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) through additive manufacturing technologies. The platform connects web shops with local three-dimensional (3D) printing facilities, allowing customers to purchase products that are manufactured on-demand in their vicinity. We present the platform's Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), deployment on the Microsoft Azure cloud, and integration with three different 3D printer models in a testbed environment. A detailed cost-benefit analysis demonstrates the economic viability of the approach, which generates significant profit margins. The platform implements a weighted profit-sharing model that fairly compensates all stakeholders based on their investment and operational responsibilities. Our results show that on-demand, localised manufacturing through MaaS is not only technically feasible but also economically viable, while reducing environmental impact through shortened supply chains and elimination of inventory waste. The platform's extensible architecture allows for future integration of additional manufacturing technologies beyond 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Experimentation: Bayesian Optimization over Problem Formulation Space for Accelerated Alloy Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated discovery in materials science demands autonomous systems capable of dynamically formulating and solving design problems. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Bayesian optimization over a problem formulation space to identify optimal design formulations in line with decision-maker preferences. By mapping various design scenarios to a multi attribute utility function, our approach enables the system to balance conflicting objectives such as ductility, yield strength, density, and solidification range without requiring an exact problem definition at the outset. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through an in silico case study on a Mo-Nb-Ti-V-W alloy system targeted for gas turbine engine blade applications. The framework converges on a sweet spot that satisfies critical performance thresholds, illustrating that integrating problem formulation discovery into the autonomous design loop can significantly streamline the experimental process. Future work will incorporate human feedback to further enhance the adaptability of the system in real-world experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Known Unknowns: Out-of-Distribution Property Prediction in Materials and Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery of high-performance materials and molecules requires identifying extremes with property values that fall outside the known distribution. Therefore, the ability to extrapolate to out-of-distribution (OOD) property values is critical for both solid-state materials and molecular design. Our objective is to train predictor models that extrapolate zero-shot to higher ranges than in the training data, given the chemical compositions of solids or molecular graphs and their property values. We propose using a transductive approach to OOD property prediction, achieving improvements in prediction accuracy. In particular, the True Positive Rate (TPR) of OOD classification of materials and molecules improved by 3x and 2.5x, respectively, and precision improved by 2x and 1.5x compared to non-transductive baselines. Our method leverages analogical input-target relations in the training and test sets, enabling generalization beyond the training target support, and can be applied to any other material and molecular tasks.</description>

      <title>KARMA: Leveraging Multi-Agent LLMs for Automated Knowledge Graph Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) is critical for modern AI systems, but manual curation struggles to scale with the rapid growth of scientific literature. This paper presents KARMA, a novel framework employing multi-agent large language models (LLMs) to automate KG enrichment through structured analysis of unstructured text. Our approach employs nine collaborative agents, spanning entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution that iteratively parse documents, verify extracted knowledge, and integrate it into existing graph structures while adhering to domain-specific schema. Experiments on 1,200 PubMed articles from three different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KARMA in knowledge graph enrichment, with the identification of up to 38,230 new entities while achieving 83.1\% LLM-verified correctness and reducing conflict edges by 18.6\% through multi-layer assessments.</description>

      <title>The Redundancy Matrix as a Performance Indicator for Structural Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of static indeterminacy and its spatial distribution characterize load-bearing structures independent of a specific load case. The redundancy matrix stores the distribution of the static indeterminacy on its main diagonal, and thereby offers the possibility to use this property for the assessment of structures. It is especially suitable to be used in early planning stages for design exploration. In this paper, performance indicators with respect to robustness and assemblability are derived from the redundancy matrix. For each of the performance indicators, a detailed matrix-based derivation is given and the application is showcased with various truss examples.</description>

      <title>Audio-visual cross-modality knowledge transfer for machine learning-based in-situ monitoring in laser additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect anomalies and defects in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) processes. While multimodal fusion, which integrates data from visual, audio, and other modalities, can improve monitoring performance, it also increases hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper introduces a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology for LAM in-situ monitoring, which transfers knowledge from a source modality to a target modality. CMKT enhances the representativeness of the features extracted from the target modality, allowing the removal of source modality sensors during prediction. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. The semantic alignment method establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It employs a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of identical groups (e.g., visual and audio defective groups) and a separation loss to distinguish different groups (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free groups). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving features from one modality to another using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches. In a case study for LAM in-situ defect detection, the proposed CMKT methods were compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion. The semantic alignment method achieved an accuracy of 98.6% while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the 98.2% accuracy obtained through multimodal fusion. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we discovered that semantic alignment CMKT can extract more representative features while reducing noise by leveraging the inherent correlations between modalities.</description>

      <title>CSP-AIT-Net: A contrastive learning-enhanced spatiotemporal graph attention framework for short-term metro OD flow prediction with asynchronous inflow tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is crucial for enhancing metro system efficiency, optimizing scheduling, and improving passenger experiences. However, current models often fail to effectively capture the asynchronous departure characteristics of OD flows and underutilize the inflow and outflow data, which limits their prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CSP-AIT-Net, a novel spatiotemporal graph attention framework designed to enhance OD flow prediction by incorporating asynchronous inflow tracking and advanced station semantics representation. Our framework restructures the OD flow prediction paradigm by first predicting outflows and then decomposing OD flows using a spatiotemporal graph attention mechanism. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a masking mechanism and propose asynchronous passenger flow graphs that integrate inflow and OD flow with conservation constraints. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to extract high-dimensional land use semantics of metro stations, enriching the contextual understanding of passenger mobility patterns. Validation of the Shanghai metro system demonstrates improvement in short-term OD flow prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to enhancing metro operational efficiency, scheduling precision, and overall system safety.</description>

      <title>LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.
