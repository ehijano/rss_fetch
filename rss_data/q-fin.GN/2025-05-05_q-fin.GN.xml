      <title>Systemic Risk in the European Insurance Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interdependencies between the European insurance sector and key financial markets-equity, bond, and banking-by extending the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition framework to a broad set of performance and risk indicators. Our empirical analysis, based on a comprehensive dataset spanning January 2000 to October 2024, shows that the insurance market is not a passive receiver of external shocks but an active contributor in the propagation of systemic risk, particularly during periods of financial stress such as the subprime crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant heterogeneity is observed across subsectors, with diversified multiline insurers and reinsurance playing key roles in shock transmission. Moreover, our granular company-level analysis reveals clusters of systemically central insurance companies, underscoring the presence of a core group that consistently exhibits high interconnectivity and influence in risk propagation.</description>

      <title>RIVCoin: an alternative, integrated, CeFi/DeFi-Vaulted Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This whitepaper introduces RIVCoin, a cryptocurrency built on Cosmos, fully stabilized by a diversified portfolio of both CeFi and DeFi assets, available in a digital, non-custodial wallet called RIV Wallet, that aims to provide Users an easy way to access the cryptocurrency markets, compliant to the strictest AML laws and regulations up to date. The token is a cryptocurrency at any time stabilized by a basket of assets: reserves are invested in a portfolio composed long term by 50% of CeFi assets, comprised of Fixed Income, Equity, Mutual and Hedge Funds and 50% of diversified strategies focused on digital assets, mainly staking and LP farming on the major, battle tested DeFi protocols. The cryptocurrency, as well as the dollar before Bretton Woods, is always fully stabilized by vaulted proof of assets: it is born and managed as a decentralized token, minted by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and entirely stabilized by assets evaluated by professional independent third parties. Users will trade, pool, and exchange the token without any intermediary, being able to merge them into a Liquidity Pool whose rewards will be composed by both the trading fees and the liquidity rewards derived from the reserve's seigniorage.
  Users who wish and decide to pool RIVCoin in the Liquidity Pool will receive additional RIVCoin for themselves, and new RIVCoin are minted when the reserves increase in value or in case of purchase of new RIVCoin. The proposed model allows for alignment of incentives: decreasing the risk exposure by wealthier Users, but implicitly increasing that of smaller ones to a level perceived by them as still sustainable. Users indirectly benefit from the access to the rewards of sophisticated cryptocurrency portfolios hitherto precluded to them, without this turning into a disadvantage for the wealthy User.</description>
