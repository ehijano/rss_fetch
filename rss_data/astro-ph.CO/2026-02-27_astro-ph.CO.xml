      <title>First Determination of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ Using Molecular Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar B0218+357 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and obtained absorption spectra of the $J$=2-1 and $J$=3-2 rotational transitions of HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, H$^{13}$CN, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ at the cosmological redshift of $z\!=\!0.68$. For HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and HNC, we identified two distinct absorption components that are common to both transitions, whereas a single component was detected in the isotopologue spectra. In this paper, we accurately evaluate the excitation temperatures and their uncertainties from the absorption strengths of these components, and use them to determine the CMB temperature. Uncertainties in the continuum covering factor were propagated into the excitation temperature via Monte Carlo sampling. We further corrected the observed optical depths for biases due to column-density nonuniformity by assuming a lognormal column-density distribution. Under the assumption that the rotational levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derived excitation temperature profiles in the optically thin regime. Because the excitation of HCO$^+$ is biased by an additional velocity component and partial collisional excitation, this species was excluded from the final determination of the CMB temperature. From a weighted mean of the excitation temperatures obtained from HCN and HNC, we determined the CMB temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ to be ${4.50\pm0.17\,\mathrm{K}}$. This constitutes the first measurement of the CMB temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ based on a quasar absorption line system and represents the most precise determination at this redshift, highly consistent with the standard Big Bang cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Shadows of Giants: Constraints on Stupendously Large Black Holes from Negative Sources against the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stupendously large astrophysical black holes (SLABs) are hypothetical black holes with masses of more than a trillion Suns. Because observable consequences of their existence have only recently been seriously considered, there have been relatively few constraints on their abundance. This work motivates a simple yet powerful constraint on SLABs: their huge shadows are visible against the cosmic microwave background. SLABs could thus appear as negative sources in microwave data. In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\gtrsim 10^{17}\ M_{\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $\Omega_{BH} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$--$10^{18}\ M_{\odot}$. I also discuss the effects of accretion and their implications for the limits: SLAB growth, positive accretion luminosity, and obscuring material.</description>

      <title>The ASKAP Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Extragalactic Survey - Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is designed to systematically explore the dynamic radio sky, detecting sources that vary on timescales from minutes to several years. In this paper, we present Data Release 1 of the VAST Extragalactic Survey, which targets slowly evolving synchrotron transients in the southern sky. The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\sim 12300\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution. Each field was revisited approximately every two months, yielding 10 or 11 observations per field. The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified. This data release provides the first large-scale, high-cadence, uniform view of long-term radio variability in the extragalactic sky and lays the groundwork for future population studies of radio transients with ASKAP.</description>

      <title>(1+1)-Dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation with contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of contact interactions in the dynamics of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) modeled through the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation in one spatial dimension. While the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Redshift evolution of the Hubble constant: Constraints and new insights from an interacting dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a modified interacting dark energy (IDE) model to study the redshift evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), in light of the Hubble tension. In this framework, the energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence of $H_0$. We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $\alpha = 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids as a probe of the nature of dark matter: simulations and galaxy survey forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voids are parts of the cosmic web least affected by non-linearities and baryonic feedback. We thus calculate the sensitivity of voids to the nature of dark matter (DM), using ultra-light axions as a concrete model and the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and \textit{Euclid} galaxy surveys as observational settings. We simulate axion effects on voids using mass-peak patch simulations and find that: (i) axions suppress the formation of lower-mass halos leading to the merging of smaller (radius $&lt; 25\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids into fewer larger (radius $&gt; 25\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids; and (ii) voids in the presence of axions are emptier of halos, thereby suppressing the void-halo correlation function. These effects strengthen as axion particle mass $m_\mathrm{a}$ decreases. We forecast improvements in axion constraints from the void size function (VSF; the void number density as function of their radius). A \textit{Euclid}-like survey (effective volume of $73\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ with a prior on the other $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters from the Simons Observatory cosmic microwave background experiment) can limit the axion energy density (for $m_\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$) to $&lt; 4.6\%$ of the DM (at $95\%$ credibility), about two times stronger than current limits. Conversely, we show that a Universe with a dark sector consisting of axions at the $10\%$ level, as motivated by the string axiverse, can be recovered with $\sim 2 \sigma$ preference. A DESI-like survey achieves comparable results. Axion and $\Lambda$CDM parameters have different degeneracies given VSF and galaxy power spectrum data, indicating future combined analyses will be most powerful in disentangling the DM nature. We anticipate our results will extend to other (e.g., warm or interacting) DM models.</description>

      <title>Correlated residuals in Tully-Fisher and Fundamental Plane relations and their impact on peculiar velocity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher (TF) and Fundamental Plane (FP) relations are widely used to infer extragalactic distances and peculiar velocities, enabling measurements of large-scale velocity statistics and cosmological parameters. Using the Millennium-TNG hydrodynamical simulation, we assess the accuracy of these methods in the presence of realistic galaxy formation physics. We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\sim10\,\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties -- such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass -- mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>The LOFAR sub-arcsecond view of the high-redshift radio relic in PSZ2G091.83+26.11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced inverse Compton (IC) losses at high redshift steepen diffuse radio spectra in galaxy clusters, making low-frequency (~100 MHz) observations favorable. However, low-frequency studies often lack the resolution needed to locate particle acceleration sites or separate diffuse emission from radio galaxies. In this paper, we unveil the properties of the radio relic in the distant cluster PSZ2G091.83+26.11 (z=0.822) by resolving the acceleration site and inspecting the downstream region. Using the European LOFAR (ILT) at 145 MHz, we study a radio relic at (sub-)arcsecond resolution for the first time below 1 GHz, complemented by arcsecond-resolution VLA data at higher frequencies. We confirm the diffuse emission is not a radio galaxy. A spectral index gradient toward the cluster center matches previous 5'' maps. High-resolution 0.4'' and 1.9'' images reveal emission ahead of the shock, connecting the relic to a radio galaxy. 1.9'' profiles across the downstream at 145 MHz and 3.0 GHz follow a log-normal magnetic field distribution. The 145 MHz shock surface shows a sharp discontinuity at the same location of a change in electron density, Rotation Measure, and fractional polarization, likely tied to magnetic field changes. Finally, we find hints of redshift evolution of the radio power versus cluster mass correlation. The impressive angular resolution achievable by the LOFAR long baselines is opening an unprecedented view of the low energetic plasma in galaxy clusters. This is extremely significant in the case of high-redshift clusters, where radio emission at low frequencies is less affected by energy losses but its detection is strongly limited by poor resolution.</description>

      <title>Imprints of primordial magnetic fields on the late-time Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generated in the early Universe may leave observable imprints in the present-day large-scale structure. However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.</description>

      <title>Lepton asymmetry leading to baryogenesis by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryogenesis remains an unresolved problem in cosmology, with existing mechanisms facing significant caveats. We show that the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on neutrinos produce the lepton asymmetry $\sim 10^{-10}$ which subsequently produces the baryon asymmetry. We consider the Dirac Lagrangian in curved spacetime in local coordinates exhibiting Hermitian pseudo-vector and non-Hermitian vector terms. These terms lead to energy splitting between weakly interacting neutrinos and antineutrinos, resulting in their unequal number densities and hence a lepton asymmetry. While the non-Hermitian effect leads to a non-conserved total probability of neutrinos, the leptogenesis due to gravitational effects of a PBH could be significant until the nucleosynthesis era. This in turn produces baryon asymmetry from the symmetry of lepton and baryon numbers via the sphaleron process in the electro-weak era. We show that in the most conservative scenario, the PBHs of mass $\sim 10^{12}$ g and spin $\sim 0.01$ produce the observed baryogenesis at temperature 130 GeV, when such PBHs are available abundantly. However, massive PBHs also could produce the observed asymmetry, assuming the non/anti-Hermitian vector couplings for neutrino and anti-neutrino get canceled from the Lagrangian, leading the system to be Hermitian.</description>

      <title>The global structure of the time delay likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a fundamental pathology in the likelihood for time delay inference which challenges standard inference methods. By analysing the likelihood for time delay inference with Gaussian process light curve models, we show that it generically develops a boundary-driven "W"-shape with a global maximum at the true delay and gradual rises towards the edges of the observation window. This arises because time delay estimation is intrinsically extrapolative. In practice, global samplers such as nested sampling are steered towards spurious edge modes unless strict convergence criteria are adopted. We demonstrate this with simulations and show that the effect strengthens with higher data density over a fixed time span. To ensure convergence, we provide concrete guidance, notably increasing the number of live points. Further, we show that methods implicitly favouring small delays, for example optimisers and local MCMC, induce a bias towards larger $H_0$. Our results clarify failure modes and offer practical remedies for robust fully Bayesian time delay inference.</description>

      <title>Current-carrying string network evolution in an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are topological defects arising in a variety of cosmological scenarios, as the Universe undergoes symmetry-breaking phase transitions, whose discovery would offer valuable insight into the high-energy physics that shaped the early Universe. To interpret such a detection, robust theoretical models are essential. The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We consider a renormalizable extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) endowed by an R and a gauged B - L symmetry. The model incorporates chaotic inflation driven by a quartic potential, associated with the Higgs superfields which lead to a spontaneous breaking of U(1)B-L. Consistency with the ACT data is achieved by considering a fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potential which includes two free parameters (p,N) constrained in the ranges 1.355&lt;p&lt;6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;N&lt;0.7. An explanation of the mu term of the MSSM is also provided, under the condition that a related parameter in the superpotential is somewhat small. Baryogenesis occurs via non-thermal leptogenesis which is also realized by the inflaton's decay to the lightest and/or next-to-lightest right-handed neutrinos for normal ordered light neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Environment as the Primary Driver of Dwarf Satellite Statistics</title>

Abstract: Context:Satellite dwarf galaxies provide key constraints on galaxy formation and evolution as their abundance and spatial distribution reflect both host properties and large-scale environment.
  Aims:This study quantifies the dependence of satellite populations on host stellar mass, morphology and star formation activity across diverse environments and traces their evolution with cosmic time within the LCDM framework.
  Methods:The Millennium simulation combined with the semi-analytic model is employed to construct consistent samples of host galaxies brighter than Mr &lt; -16 and their satellites (M_* &gt;= 3x10^5 M_sun, Mr &lt; -9) within their virial radius. Satellite abundance and radial profiles are analyzed in cluster, group and void environments and their evolution is traced from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins.
  Results:Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for. Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids. At z=0 radial profiles reveal strong central concentrations in voids flattened distributions in clusters and intermediate trends in groups. Their redshift evolution shows progressive flattening for low- and intermediate-mass hosts in dense environments stability for massive hosts and increasing central concentration in voids. The cosmic evolution of satellite abundance further highlights distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups and strong late-time suppression in clusters.
  Conclusions:The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are governed primarily by environment with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators. Forthcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope are expected to provide stringent tests of these predictions.</description>

      <title>Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars: Spite Plateau of Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed lithum (Li) abundance of Galactic halo stars mainly fall within the range of 2.0--2.4 dex. This nearly constant value, known as the Spite plateau, is approximately a factor of three lower than the value predicted from cosmic microwave background measurements and standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This discrepancy -- referred to as the cosmological Li problem -- is considered a potential indication of new physics or astrophysical processes. We employed models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to explain the Spite plateau. The rotating models predict that Li abundances in stars with ages of roughly 8--13 Gyr and effective temperatures between 6400 and 5900 K generally fall within 2.0--2.4 dex, forming a well-defined Li plateau, followed by a sharp decline in Li abundance down to about 5200 K. The Li plateau results from the combined effects of variations in convection zone depth, gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields. For red giant branch stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \lesssim$ 5200 K, the rotating models predict another Li plateau with an abundance of about 1.0 dex. These results are in good agreement with observations. Moreover, the initial Li abundance of 2.72 dex adopted in the models matches the BBN prediction, implying that the Li problem arises from stellar Li depletion. Furthermore, the rotating models also reproduce the Li and Be distributions of the sample that exhibit the Spite plateau meltdown and Be deviation.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamics of the $SU(4)$ gauge theory with a single flavor of fundamental quarks is analyzed on the lattice with dynamical fermion simulations, which is the low-energy sector of a realistic, strongly-interacting dark matter model -- the Hyper Stealth Dark Matter. The gravitational wave spectrum from the first-order confinement transition in the early universe is further calculated, where the effect of the dark sea quarks, which decrease the interface tension in the effective potential of the Polyakov loop, is shown numerically to lower the gravitational wave amplitude.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum at low redshifts with MIGHTEE data: comparison with detected HI galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping provides a statistical approach to tracing the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe. We apply the HI intensity mapping technique to interferometric data from the MeerKAT International GHz-Tiered Extragalactic Explorations (MIGHTEE) Survey, analysing 17.5 hours of a single pointing in the COSMOS field, using a 60 MHz sub-band in the frequency range 1332 - 1392 MHz ($0.02 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.07$). Using a delay-spectrum-based estimator, we measure the HI power spectrum on sub-megaparsec scales and compare it directly to the power spectrum inferred from a catalogue of individually detected HI galaxies in the same field. After mitigating low-level broadband contamination through conservative outlier flagging in the three-dimensional power spectrum, cross-correlation of time-split visibilities yields a statistically significant detection on scales $3 \lesssim k \lesssim 20 \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a total signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 13$. Over this range, the power spectra obtained from visibilities and detected galaxies are consistent within uncertainties and have comparable amplitudes of order $10^{-2}$ - $10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{mK}^2 \mathrm{Mpc}^3$. End-to-end validation is performed by propagating detected galaxies through the power spectrum estimator via both direct intensity-field construction and simulated visibilities, demonstrating agreement up to $k \sim 20 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, beyond which measurements become noise-dominated. A statistically significant correlation is also observed between the data and the simulated visibilities from the detected HI galaxies, which should be free of systematics. These results provide a self-consistent validation of interferometric HI intensity mapping at low redshift and demonstrate agreement with galaxy-based measurements within the same cosmological volume.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Evolution of Galactic Star Formation with Halo Coupling, AGN Quenching and Hopf Bifurcation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for galactic evolution based on a coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillator, implemented with the \textbf{Stochastic Hopf Engine}. Gas density ($G$) and star formation rate ($S$) co-evolve through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, capturing the transition from quiescent stability to merger-driven starbursts. Scatter in dark matter halo properties, modeled as multiplicative noise via the \textbf{Euler--Maruyama method}, broadens the bifurcation into a regime where noise-induced bursts occur below the deterministic threshold.
  Simulations reveal a periodic signature, the \textbf{Galactic Heartbeat}, emerging as a deterministic limit cycle validated by the \textbf{data3} resonance peak in the star-formation spectrum. A radial reduction yields an effective \textbf{Fokker--Planck equation} for burst amplitude; its stationary solution matches numerical PDFs, providing statistical closure.
  Including differential shear $\Omega(r)$ and spatially varying bifurcation fields reproduces spiral morphologies and AGN-driven quenching. Driving the growth parameter sub-critical ($r_{agn} &lt; 0$) yields ``Red and Dead'' cores via attractor collapse. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency, offering a minimal yet interpretable framework linking local feedback and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study realistic models predicting primordial black hole (PBH) formation from density fluctuations generated in a first-order phase transition. We show that the second-order correction in the expansion of the bubble nucleation rate is necessary for accurate predictions and quantify its impact on the abundance of PBHs and gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the distribution of the fluctuations becomes more Gaussian as the second-order term increases. Consequently, models that predict the same PBH abundances can produce different GW spectra.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Potential Inflation in the ACT Era: From CMB to Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.</description>

      <title>Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias and matter clustering non-linearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.</description>

      <title>Overview of the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project for Astronomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS): Clustering properties of CRS BG and LRG target catalogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope Cosmology Redshift Survey (4MOST CRS) will obtain 5.4 million spectroscopic redshifts over 5700deg^2 to map large-scale structure and enable measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, growth rates via redshift-space distortions, and cross-correlations with weak-lensing surveys. We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics, and redshift distributions of the bright galaxy (BG) and luminous red galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Survey DR10.1 (LS) imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, $w(\theta)$, test masking strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI DR1 spectroscopy. For BGs, we adopt LS MASKBITS that veto bright stars and extended sources; for LRGs, we pair these with unblurred coadds of the WISE imaging (unWISE) W1 artefact masks. These choices suppress small-scale excess power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG $r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the $w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between the North and South Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI spectroscopy recover the expected N(z), albeit with high shot noise at the brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0$) is consistent between the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprints and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing is included; halo-occupation fits are consistent with recent LRG studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections yield reliable clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure analyses with 4MOST CRS.</description>

      <title>Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning</title>

Abstract: We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for all surveys considered in this work. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.2$ and $3.4$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics, we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for our wavelet-based statistics, but not for $C_\ell$'s. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</description>
