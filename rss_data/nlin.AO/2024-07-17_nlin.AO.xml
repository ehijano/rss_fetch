      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), in which we incorporate the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimum minimizing exit time {\tau} . We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with N nodes, for which {\tau} scales as A ln N, where the prefactor A depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>Navigating the swarm: Deep neural networks command emergent behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting individuals in complex systems often give rise to coherent motion exhibiting coordinated global structures. Such phenomena are ubiquitously observed in nature, from cell migration, bacterial swarms, animal and insect groups, and even human societies. Primary mechanisms responsible for the emergence of collective behavior have been extensively identified, including local alignments based on average or relative velocity, non-local pairwise repulsive-attractive interactions such as distance-based potentials, interplay between local and non-local interactions, and cognitive-based inhomogeneous interactions. However, discovering how to adapt these mechanisms to modulate emergent behaviours remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate coordinated structures in collective behavior at desired moments with intended global patterns by fine-tuning an inter-agent interaction rule. Our strategy employs deep neural networks, obeying the laws of dynamics, to find interaction rules that command desired collective structures. The decomposition of interaction rules into distancing and aligning forces, expressed by polynomial series, facilitates the training of neural networks to propose desired interaction models. Presented examples include altering the mean radius and size of clusters in vortical swarms, timing of transitions from random to ordered states, and continuously shifting between typical modes of collective motions. This strategy can even be leveraged to superimpose collective modes, resulting in hitherto unexplored but highly practical hybrid collective patterns, such as protective security formations. Our findings reveal innovative strategies for creating and controlling collective motion, paving the way for new applications in robotic swarm operations, active matter organisation, and for the uncovering of obscure interaction rules in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of complexity and the origins of biochemical life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern physics and biology satisfactorily explain the passage from the Big Bang to the formation of Earth and the first cells to present-day life, respectively, the origins of biochemical life still remain an open question. Since life, as we know it, requires extremely long genetic polymers, any answer to the question must explain how an evolving system of polymers of ever-increasing length could come about on a planet that otherwise consisted only of small molecular building blocks. In this work, we show that, under realistic constraints, an abstract polymer model can exhibit dynamics such that attractors in the polymer population space with a higher average polymer length are also more probable. We generalize from the model and formalize the notions of complexity and evolution for chemical reaction networks with multiple attractors. The complexity of a species is defined as the minimum number of reactions needed to produce it from a set of building blocks, which in turn is used to define a measure of complexity for an attractor. A transition between attractors is considered to be a progressive evolution if the attractor with the higher probability also has a higher complexity. In an environment where only monomers are readily available, the attractor with a higher average polymer length is more complex. Thus, our abstract polymer model can exhibit progressive evolution for a range of thermodynamically plausible rate constants. We also formalize criteria for open-ended and historically-contingent evolution and explain the role of autocatalysis in obtaining them. Our work provides a basis for searching for prebiotically plausible scenarios in which long polymers can emerge and yield populations with even longer polymers.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven self-assembly of emerin nanodomains at the nuclear envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerin, a nuclear membrane protein with important biological roles in mechanotransduction and nuclear shape adaptation, self-assembles into nanometer-size domains at the inner nuclear membrane. The size and emerin occupancy of these nanodomains change with applied mechanical stress as well as under emerin mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Through a combination of theory and experiment we show here that a simple reaction-diffusion model explains the self-assembly of emerin nanodomains. Our model yields quantitative agreement with experimental observations on the size and occupancy of emerin nanodomains for wild-type emerin and EDMD-associated mutations of emerin, with and without applied forces, and allows successful prediction of emerin diffusion coefficients from observations on the overall properties of emerin nanodomains. Our results provide a physical understanding of EDMD-associated defects in emerin organization in terms of changes in key reaction and diffusion properties of emerin and its nuclear binding partners.</description>

      <title>Application of the thin-film equations in modelling of Marangoni flow patterns amongst surfactant source and drain locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfactants that are deposited at aqueous liquid films have the ability to generate surface tension gradients at the air-water interface, and thereby induce Marangoni flow. Combined with the production and depletion of surfactants at different locations of source and drains, out-of-equilibrium surface tension gradients can be sustained, resulting in Marangoni flow patterns that drive e.g., self-organization of amphiphile myelin assemblies. Here, a mathematical model based on the thin-film equations is proposed to simulate these flow patterns. The model equations are based on the surfactant source and drain concentrations, film-height and surfactant bulk concentration. We present a numerical scheme for approximating the model equations and discuss the numerically observed properties of the model.</description>

      <title>Bio-Silicon Intelligence System: Integrating Analogue and Digital Computing in a Biological-Silicon Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Bio-Silicon Intelligence System (BSIS), an innovative hybrid platform integrating biological neural networks with silicon-based computing. BSIS combines computational systems with rat brains through carbon nanotube-coated electrodes, enabling high-fidelity neural interfacing and bidirectional communication. Neural signals are read from a custom multi-electrode array (MEA), processed via a FreeEEG32 board and BrainFlow, and analyzed using proprietary software. The system employs a dual signaling approach for training the rat brain, incorporating a reward solution and human-inaudible distress sounds. This paper details the design, functionality, and technical specifications of BSIS, highlighting its potential to revolutionize bioengineering and neurotechnology.</description>
