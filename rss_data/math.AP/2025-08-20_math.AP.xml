      <title>Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Biot coupling via a moving reticular plate interface: existence of weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of finite-energy weak solutions to a regularized three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem involving an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid and a multilayered poro(visco)elastic structure. The structure consists of a thick layer modeled by the Biot equations and a thin reticular plate with inertia and elastic energy, transparent to fluid flow. The coupling is nonlinear in the sense that it takes place on a moving interface that is not known a priori but is defined by the solution itself, making the problem a moving-boundary problem. This nonlinear free-boundary coupling, combined with the limited regularity of the Biot displacement, renders the classical weak formulation ill-defined at finite energy. To address this, we introduce a minimally invasive regularization based on a suitable extension and convolution of the Biot displacement, chosen so that the regularized problem remains consistent with the original model. We then construct approximate solutions to the regularized problem via a Lie operator-splitting scheme and derive uniform energy bounds. While these bounds ensure weak and weak* convergence, passing to the limit in the nonlinear terms requires refined compactness arguments, including variants of the Aubin-Lions lemma and tools adapted to moving non-Lipschitz interfaces. The result applies in particular to the purely elastic case (without structural damping) as well as the poroviscoelastic case. This work extends the two-dimensional analysis of Kuan-\v{C}ani\'c-Muha 2024 to the fully three-dimensional setting and, to our knowledge, provides the first existence result for a nonlinearly coupled, multilayer 3D Navier-Stokes-Biot FSI system with a permeable interface.</description>

      <title>The Liouville-type equation and an Onofri-type inequality on closed 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Liouville-type equation
  \[\Delta ^2 u-\lambda_1\kappa\Delta u+\lambda_2\kappa^2(1-\mathrm e^{4u})=0\]
  on a closed Riemannian manifold \((M^4,g)\) with \(\operatorname{Ric}\geqslant 3\kappa g\) and \(\kappa&gt;0\). Using the method of invariant tensors, we derive a differential identity to classify solutions within certain ranges of the parameters \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2\). A key step in our proof is a second-order derivative estimate, which is established via the continuity method. As an application of the classification results, we derive an Onofri-type inequality on the 4-sphere and prove its rigidity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the subcritical biharmonic equation \[\Delta ^2 u=u^\alpha\] on a complete, connected, and non-compact Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Using the method of invariant tensors, we derive a differential identity to obtain a Liouville theorem, i.e., there is no positive $C^4$ solution if $n\geqslant5$ and $1&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{n+4}{n-4}$. We establish a crucial second-order derivative estimate, which is established via Bernstein's technique and the continuity method.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the NLS hierarchy with nonzero boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the NLS hierarchy with the nonzero boundary condition $q(t, x) \rightarrow q_\pm \in \mathbb{S}^1$ as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$ and prove that it is global well-posedness for initial data of high regularity. Specifically, we prove well-posedness of the problem for the perturbation $p = q - q_\ast$ from a time-independent front $q_\ast$ connecting $q_-$ to $q_+$. The equations in the NLS hierarchy are defined using a recurrence relation derived from the expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the Jost solutions associated to the Lax operator. Using this recurrence relation, we are able to determine explicit formulas for all terms in the NLS hierarchy with at most one factor that is $q_x$, $\bar{q}_x$, or a derivative thereof. We then view the equation for $p$ as part of a large class of dispersive nonlinear systems, for which we develop a local well-posedness theory in weighted Sobolev spaces. This involves certain local smoothing and maximal function estimates, which we establish for a large class of dispersion relations with finitely many critical points. Finally, we globalize the solutions using the conserved energies constructed in [1, 2].

      <title>Borderline regularity in singular free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the borderline regularity of local minimizers of energy functionals under minimal assumptions on the potential term $\sigma$. When $\sigma$ is merely bounded and measurable, we show that sign-changing minimizers are Log-Lipschitz continuous, which represents the optimal regularity in this general setting. In the one-phase case, however, we establish gradient bounds for minimizers along their free boundaries, revealing a structural gain in regularity. Most notably, we prove that if $\sigma$ is continuous, then minimizers are of class $C^1$ along the free boundary, thereby identifying a sharp threshold for differentiability in terms of the regularity of the potential.</description>

      <title>A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how stability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can be more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on an analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator, $\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper, we show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to multiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of lifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain is well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which is necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate spatial differential operator, $D^\alpha=\partial_{s_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\partial_{s_N}^{\alpha_N}$, on the PDE domain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable kernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any suitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE, parameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for PDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of positive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the process of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is used to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining accurate bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <title>Steady states of FitzHugh-Nagumo-type systems with sign-changing coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish existence and multiplicity results for steady-state solutions of spatially heterogeneous FitzHugh-Nagumo-type systems, extending the existing theory from constant to variable coefficients that may change sign. Specifically, we study the system Specifically, we study the system
  $-\Delta u + a(x)v = f(x,u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$,
  $-\Delta v + b(x)v = c(x)u$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$,
  where $N \geqslant 3$, the coefficients $a,b,c : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ are $L^\infty_{\mathrm{loc}}$-functions bounded from below, and $f:\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a Carath\'eodory function with subcritical growth. For assumptions permitting sign changes and non-coercivity of the coefficients, we prove the existence of a mountain pass solution. In the case where $a,b,c$ do not change sign, still allowing non-coercive behavior, we additionally establish the existence of componentwise positive and negative solutions.</description>

      <title>Pulled fronts are not (just) pulled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Front propagation into unstable states is often determined by the linearization, that is, propagation speeds agree with predictions from the linearized equation at the unstable state. The leading edge behavior is then a Gaussian tail propagating with the linear spreading speed. Fronts following this leading edge are commonly referred to as pulled fronts, alluding to the idea that they are ``pulled'' by this leading-edge Gaussian tail. We describe here a class of examples that exhibits how these leading-order effects do not completely describe the dynamics in the wake of the front. In fact, leading edge behavior predicts at most two possible invasion scenarios, associated with positive and negative amplitudes of the Gaussian tail, but our examples exhibit three or more invasion fronts with different states in the wake. The resulting invasion process therefore leaves behind a state that is not solely determined by the leading edge, and thus not just pulled by the Gaussian tail.</description>

      <title>Critical trajectories in kinetic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct critical trajectories in kinetic geometry, i.e. curves in $\mathbb{R}^{1+2n}$ that are: tangential to the vector fields $\partial_t+v\cdot \nabla_x$ and $\nabla_v$, connecting any two given points, respecting the underlying kinetic scaling, and with the property, that the singularity of the $v$-tangent vector near the starting point equates the degeneracy of the dependency of the curve velocity in terms of the endpoint velocity.
  The construction is based on Newton's laws of motion, where the ansatz for the forcing of the kinetic trajectory is the superposition of functions combining the correct power scaling with desynchronised logarithmic oscillations.
  These critical trajectories provide a robust and versatile ''almost exponential map'' that allows to prove several functional analytic estimates. We introduce a notion of kinetic mollification and, as an application, deduce the kinetic Sobolev inequality with optimal exponent without relying on the fundamental solution.
  Moreover, we establish a universal estimate for the logarithm of positive supersolutions to the Kolmogorov equation with rough coefficients inspired by the work of Moser (1961, 1964) on elliptic and parabolic problems. Combining this estimate with De Giorgi-Moser iterations and a lemma due to Bombieri and Giusti, we give an alternative proof of the (weak) Harnack inequality for the Kolmogorov equation with rough coefficients, following the ideas of Moser (1971). Our result gives the optimal range of exponents in the weak Harnack inequality and the optimal (geometric) dependency of the Harnack constant on the bounds of the diffusion matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study a class of fully nonlinear double-divergence systems with free boundaries associated with a minimization problem. The variational structure of Hessian-dependent functional plays a fundamental role in proving the existence of the minimizers and then the existence of the solutions for the system. In addition, we establish gains of the integrability for the double-divergence equation. Consequently, we improve the regularity for the fully nonlinear equation in Sobolev and H\"older spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal constant in the nonlocal nonlinear Poincar\'e-Wirtinger inequality in $(a,b)\subset\mathbb R$: \begin{equation*} \lambda_\alpha(p,q,r){\left(\int_{a}^{b}|u|^{q}dx\right)^\frac pq}\le{\int_{a}^{b}|u'|^{p}dx+\alpha\left|\int_{a}^{b}|u|^{r-2}u\, dx\right|^{\frac p{r-1}}}, \end{equation*}where $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, $p,q,r &gt;1$ such that $\frac{2p}{p+2}\le q\le p$ and $\frac q2+1\le r \le q+\frac q p$. This problem admits a variational characterization in the nonlocal setting, as the associated Euler-Lagrange equation involves an integral term depending on the unknown function over the entire interval of definition.
  We prove the existence of a critical value $\alpha_C=\alpha_C (p,q,r)$ such that the minimizers are even and have constant sign for $\alpha\le\alpha_{C}$, while they are odd for $\alpha\geq \alpha_{C}$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a first-order-in-time model for nonlinear acoustics with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study well-posedness of a first-order-in-time model for nonlinear acoustics with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions in fractional Sobolev spaces. The analysis proceeds by first establishing well-posedness of an abstract parabolic-type semilinear evolution equation. These results are then applied to concrete operators and function spaces that capture the boundary conditions relevant for realistic modeling.
  Our approach is based on the spectral decomposition of a positive definite self-adjoint operator, with solution regularity characterized via the domains of its fractional powers. Employing Galerkin's method and the Newton-Kantorovich theorem, we prove well-posedness for the abstract nonlinear system with possibly nonhomogeneous boundary data.
  The connection between (spectral) fractional powers of the Laplacian and fractional Sobolev spaces due to interpolation theory allows us to transfer these results to the nonlinear acoustic model under nonhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, yielding fractional Sobolev regularity. For Hodge/Lions boundary conditions, we establish well-posedness with solutions in classical Sobolev spaces of integer order.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limit of the principal eigenvalue of asymmetric nonlocal diffusion operators and propagation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fixed $c\in\mathbb R$, $l&gt;0$ and a general non-symmetric kernel function $J(x)$ satisfying a standard assumption, we consider the nonlocal diffusion operator \begin{align*} \bf{L}^{J, c}_{(-l,l)}[\phi](x):=\int_{-l}^lJ(x-y)\phi(y)\,dy+c\phi'(x), \end{align*} and prove that its principal eigenvalue $\lambda_p(\bf{L}^{J, c}_{(-l,l)})$ has the following asymptotic limit: \begin{equation*}\label{l-to-infty-c} \lim\limits_{l\to \infty}\lambda_p(\bf {L}^{J, c}_{(-l,l)})=\inf\limits_{\nu\in\mathbb{R}}\big[\int_{\mathbb{R}}J(x)e^{-\nu x}\,dx+c\nu\big]. \end{equation*} We then demonstrate how this result can be applied to determine the propagation dynamics of the associated Cauchy problem \begin{equation*}
  \label{cau}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  \displaystyle u_t = d \big[\int_{\mathbb{R}} J(x-y) u(t,y) \, dy - u(t,x)\big] + f(u), &amp; t &gt; 0, \; x \in \mathbb{R},
  u(0, x) = u_0(x), &amp; x \in \mathbb{R},
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*} with a KPP nonlinear term $f(u)$. This provides a new approach to understand the propagation dynamics of KPP type models, very different from those based on traveling wave solutions or on the dynamical systems method of Weinberger (1982).</description>

      <title>Essentials of Real Analysis and Morrey-Sobolev spaces for second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs with singular first-order coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years we witness growing interest in using Real Analysis methods and results in the theory of nondivergence form partial differential equations (PDEs) and the goal of this article is to give a brief and concise introduction into the applications of several results in Real Analysis to the theory of elliptic and parabolic equations in Sobolev and Morrey-Sobolev spaces. In particular, we concentrate on such results as Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem, Fefferman-Stein theorem, theory of Muckenhoupt weights, and Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem and their role in Sobolev or Morrey-Sobolev space theory of parabolic equations with mixed norms.
  In our exposition we do not try to give the strongest known results for particular equations in particular spaces. We only show how the Real Analysis results, we present with all proofs, can be used in model cases such as the Laplace and the heat equations with singular first order terms. The only exception is the last section where we present new results.</description>

      <title>Exponential Vorticity Hessian Growth in Capillary Liquid Drop in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we concern ourselves with the evolution of a droplet of an ideal fluid in two dimensions, which has nontrivial bulk vorticity and is only subject to the effects of surface tension. We construct initial data with initial domain being a disk and initial velocity being arbitrarily small, such that the vorticity Hessian grows exponentially infinitely in time.</description>

      <title>Enhanced PINNs for data-driven solitons and parameter discovery for (2+ 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates data-driven solutions and parameter discovery to (2+1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with variable coefficients (VC-CNLSEs), which describe transverse effects in optical fiber systems under perturbed dispersion and nonlinearity. By setting different forms of perturbation coefficients, we aim to recover the dark and anti-dark one- and two-soliton structures by employing an enhanced physics-based deep neural network algorithm, namely a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The enhanced PINN algorithm leverages the locally adaptive activation function mechanism to improve convergence speed and accuracy. In the lack of data acquisition, the PINN algorithms will enhance the capability of the neural networks by incorporating physical information into the training phase. We demonstrate that applying PINN algorithms to (2+1)-dimensional VC-CNLSEs requires distinct distributions of physical information. To address this, we propose a region-specific weighted loss function with the help of residual-based adaptive refinement strategy. In the meantime, we perform data-driven parameter discovery for the model equation, classified into two categories: constant coefficient discovery and variable coefficient discovery. For the former, we aim to predict the cross-phase modulation constant coefficient under varying noise intensities using enhanced PINN with a single neural network. For the latter, we employ a dual-network strategy to predict the dynamic behavior of the dispersion and nonlinearity perturbation functions. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework holds significant potential for studying high-dimensional and complex solitonic dynamics in optical fiber systems.</description>

      <title>Absence of real resonances of Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the resonances of Dirac operators by continuing meromorphically the truncated resolvent and to establish a result about their localization : a kind of Rellich Theorem. Firstly, we consider the case of the Dirac operator in an external field which is essentially bounded and compactly supported. Secondly, we consider the case of the MIT bag model outside a smooth and bounded obstacle.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of Fractional Stochastic p-Laplace Equations Driven by Superlinear Transport Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the fractional p-Laplace equation with a polynomial drift of arbitrary order driven by superlinear transport noise. By the monotone argument, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of an abstract stochastic differential equation satisfying a fully local monotonicity condition. We then apply the abstract result to the fractional stochastic p-Laplace equation defined in a bounded domain. The main difficulty is to establish the tightness as well as the uniform integrability of a sequence of approximate solutions defined by the Galerkin method. To obtain the necessary uniform estimates, we employ the Skorokhod-Jakubowski representation theorem on a topological space instead of a metric space. Since the strong Skorokhod representation theorem is incorrect even in a complete separable metric space, we pass to the limit of stochastic integrals with respect to a sequence of Wiener processes by a weak convergence argument.</description>

      <title>Stability of spinorial Sobolev inequalities on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spinorial Sobolev inequality on the unit sphere states \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq 0, \end{equation*} with equality if and only if $\psi \in {\mathcal M}$, the set of all $-\frac 12$-Killing spinors and their conformal transformations.
  Our main result in this paper is to refine this inequality by establishing a stability inequality
  \begin{equation*} \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq {\bf c}_S\inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{M}}\Big(\int| D(\psi-\phi)|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}.
  \end{equation*}
  As a by-product of our argument, we show that elements in set $\mathcal M$ are not optimizers of another spinorial Sobolev inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}} \geq C_S \Big(\int|\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n-1}}\Big)^{\frac{n-1}{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  unlike expected by experts. They have in fact index $n+1$ and nullity $2^{[\frac n2]+2}$.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of discrete spectra of Dirichlet Laplacian in 3-dimensional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate monotonicity properties of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian in polyhedral layers of fixed width. We establish that eigenvalues below the essential spectrum threshold monotonically depend on geometric parameters defining the polyhedral layer, generalizing previous results known for planar V-shaped waveguides and conical layers. Moreover, we demonstrate non-monotone spectral behavior arising from asymmetric geometric perturbations, providing an explicit example where unfolding the polyhedral layer unexpectedly leads to the emergence of discrete eigenvalues. The limiting behavior of eigenvalues as the geometric parameters approach critical configurations is also rigorously analyzed.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Minnaert Resonances in High-contrast acoustic Structures and Applications to Invisibility Cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.</description>
