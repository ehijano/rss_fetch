      <title>Oscillations in the Dark?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>Impact of Helium II resonant absorption on the UVB modeled in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a treatment of Helium {\sc ii} absorption and re-emission into the \TD cosmological simulations to study its impact on the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB) in three dimensions. By comparing simulations with and without He {\sc ii} reprocessing, we show that it weakens the mean UVB by $\sim$3 dex from $z = 10$ to $z = 5$ between 3.5 and 4 Ryd, where the He {\sc ii} Lyman-series resonance occurs. In overdense regions, the overall UVB amplitude is higher and the impact of \HeII reprocessing is weaker, qualitatively indicating an early start to \HeII reionization near galaxies. Comparing our simulations to two popular one-dimensional UV models, we find good agreement up to 3 Ryd at $z = 5$. At higher energies, our simulation shows significantly greater He {\sc ii} absorption because it accounts for He {\sc ii} arising both in diffuse regions and in Lyman limit systems. By contrast, the comparison models account only for He {\sc ii} in Lyman limit systems, which are subdominant prior to the completion of He {\sc ii} reionization. The H {\sc i} and He {\sc ii} reionization histories are nearly unaffected by He {\sc ii} reprocessing although the cosmic star formation rate density is altered by up to $4\%$. The cosmic mass density of C {\sc iv} is reduced by $\sim$2 dex when He {\sc ii} is accounted for while Si {\sc iv}, C {\sc ii}, Mg {\sc ii}, Si {\sc ii}, and O {\sc i} are unaffected.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical systematics in Kinematic Lensing: quantifying an Intrinsic Alignment analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematic lensing (KL) is a new weak lensing technique that reduces shape noise for disk galaxies by including spectroscopically measured galaxy kinematics in addition to photometrically measured galaxy shapes. Since KL utilizes the Tully-Fisher relation, any correlation of this relation with the local environment may bias the cosmological interpretation. For the first time, we explore such a Tully-Fisher environmental dependence (TED) effect as a potential astrophysical systematic for KL. Our derivation of the TED systematic can be described in a similar analytical form as intrinsic alignment for traditional weak lensing. We demonstrate analytically that TED only impacts KL if intrinsic aligment for disk galaxies is non-zero. We further use IllustrisTNG simulations to quantify the TED effect. Our two-point correlation measurements do not yield any additional coherent signals that would indicate a systematic bias on KL, within the uncertainties set by the simulation volume.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mass-richness relation of clusters from THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main systematics in cluster cosmology is the uncertainty in the mass-observable relation. In this paper, we focus on the most direct cluster observable in optical surveys, i.e. richness, and constrain the intrinsic mass-richness (MR) relation of clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations with two runs: GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-X. We find that modeling the richness at fixed halo mass with a skewed Gaussian distribution yields a simpler and smaller scatter compared to the commonly used log-normal distribution. Additionally, we observe that baryon models have a significant impact on the scatter, while exhibiting no influence on the mass dependence and a slight effect on the amplitude in the MR relation. We select member galaxies based on both stellar mass $M_\star$ and absolute magnitude $\mathscr{M}$. We demonstrate that the MR relation obtained from these two selections can be converted to each other by using the $M_\star-\mathscr{M}$ relation. Finally, we provide a 7-parameter fitting result comprehensively capturing the dependence of the MR relation on both stellar mass cutoff and redshift.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a speculative exploration of the properties of a proposed new Dark Matter (DM) candidate in a heretofore under-explored region of parameter space. Our proposed ultra-cold candidatae has been a matter of speculation for some time,and has recently been tentatively identified via direct-detection. While unconventional, demonstrated existence of this DM candidate would have wide-ranging implications for a range of fields, from particle cosmology to exobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life (SETI).</description>

      <title>The distribution of Bayes' ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratio of Bayesian evidences is a popular tool in cosmology to compare different models. There are however several issues with this method: Bayes' ratio depends on the prior even in the limit of non-informative priors, and Jeffrey's scale, used to assess the test, is arbitrary. Moreover, the standard use of Bayes' ratio is often criticized for being unable to reject models. In this paper, we address these shortcoming by promoting evidences and evidence ratios to frequentist statistics and deriving their sampling distributions. By comparing the evidence ratios to their sampling distributions, poor fitting models can now be rejected. Our method additionally does not depend on the prior in the limit of very weak priors, thereby safeguarding the experimenter against premature rejection of a theory with a uninformative prior, and replaces the arbitrary Jeffrey's scale by probability thresholds for rejection. We provide analytical solutions for some simplified cases (Gaussian data, linear parameters, and nested models), and we apply the method to cosmological supernovae Ia data. We dub our method the FB method, for Frequentist-Bayesian.</description>

      <title>Baryon acoustic scale at $z_{\eff} = 0.166$ with the SDSS blue galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) phenomenon provides a unique opportunity to establish a standard ruler at any epoch in the history of the evolving universe. The key lies in identifying a suitable cosmological tracer to conduct the measurement. In this study, we focus on quantifying the sound horizon scale of BAO in the Local Universe. Our chosen cosmological tracer is a sample of blue galaxies from the SDSS survey, positioned at the effective redshift $z_{{\eff}} = 0.166$. Utilizing Planck-CMB input values for redshift-to-distance conversion, we derive the BAO scale $s_{\scalebox{0.65}{\rm BAO}} = 100.28 ^{+10.79} _{-22.96}$ Mpc$/h$ at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Subsequently, we extrapolate the BAO signal scale in redshift space: $\Delta z_{\scalebox{0.6}{\rm BAO}}(z_{\rm eff}=0.166)=0.0361^{+0.00262}_ {-0.0055}$. This measurement holds the potential to discriminate among dark energy models within the Local Universe. To validate the robustness of our methodology for BAO scale measurement, we conduct three additional BAO analyses using different cosmographic approaches for distance calculation from redshifts. These tests aim to identify possible biases or systematics in our measurements of $s_{\scalebox{0.65}{\rm BAO}}$. Encouragingly, our diverse cosmographic approaches yield results in statistical agreement with the primary measurement, indicating no significant deviations. Conclusively, our study contributes with a novel determination of the BAO scale in the Local Universe, at $z_{{\eff}} = 0.166$, achieved through the analysis of the SDSS blue galaxies cosmic tracer.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultra slow roll inflation using cosmological datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and PTA collaborations have raised the intriguing possibility of excess matter power at small scales. Such an increase can be achieved by ultra slow roll (USR) phase during inflationary epoch. We constrain excess power over small scales within the framework of such models using cosmological datasets, particularly of CMB anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$. We parameterize the USR phase in terms of the e-fold at the onset of USR (counted from the end of inflation) $\bar N_1$ and the duration of USR phase $\Delta N$. The former dictates the scale of enhancement in the primordial power spectrum, while the latter determines the amplitude of such an enhancement. From a joint dataset of CMB, SNIa and galaxy surveys, we obtain $\bar N_1 \lesssim 45$ with no bound on $\Delta N$. This in turn implies that the scales over which the power spectrum can deviate significantly from the nearly scale invariant behavior of a typical slow-roll model is $k \gtrsim 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. On the other hand, the Lyman-$\alpha$ data is sensitive to baryonic power spectrum along the line of sight. We consider a semi-analytic theoretical method and high spectral-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to constrain the model. The Lyman-$\alpha$ data limits both the USR parameters: $\bar N_1 \lesssim 41$ and $\Delta N \lesssim 0.4$. This constrains the amplitude of the power spectrum enhancement to be less than a factor of hundred over scales $1 \lesssim k/{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim 100$, thereby considerably improving the constraint on power over these scales as compared to the bounds arrived at from CMB spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>Survival of Gas in Subhalos and Its Impact on the 21 cm Forest Signals: Insights from Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the survival of gas within subhalos under various astrophysical processes is crucial for elucidating cosmic structure formation and evolution. We study the resilience of gas in subhalos, focusing on the impact of tidal and ram pressure stripping through hydrodynamic simulations. Our results uncover significant gas stripping primarily driven by ram pressure effects, which also profoundly influence the gas distribution within these subhalos. Notably, despite their vulnerability to ram pressure effects, the low-mass subhalos can play a pivotal role in influencing the observable characteristics of cosmic structures due to their large abundance. Specifically, we explore the application of our findings to the 21 cm forest, showing how the survival dynamics of gas in subhalos can modulate the 21 cm optical depth, a key probe for detecting minihalos in the pre-reionization era. (abridged) In this work, we further investigate the contribution of subhalos to the 21 cm optical depth with hydrodynamics simulations, particularly highlighting the trajectories and fates of subhalos within mass ranges of \(10^{4-6} M_{\odot}h^{-1}\) in a host halo of \(10^7 M_{\odot}h^{-1}\). Despite their susceptibility to ram pressure stripping, the contribution of abundant low-mass subhalos to the 21-cm optical depth is more significant than that of their massive counterparts primarily due to their greater abundance. We find that the 21-cm optical depth can be increased by a factor of approximately two due to the abundant low-mass subhalos. (abridged) Our work provides critical insights into the gas dynamics within subhalos in the early Universe, highlighting their resilience against environmental stripping effects, and their impact on observable 21-cm signals.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Web Classification through Stochastic Topological Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ASTRA (Algorithm for Stochastic Topological RAnking), a novel method designed for the classification of galaxies into principal cosmic web structures -- voids, sheets, filaments, and knots -- especially tailored for large spectroscopic surveys. ASTRA utilizes observed data and a corresponding random catalog, generating probabilities for data and random points to belong to each cosmic web type. Extensive evaluation includes testing on datasets from N-body simulations (dark matter only and hydrodynamical) and observations, incorporating visual inspections and quantitative analyses of mass and volume filling fractions. ASTRA demonstrates proficiency in constructing void size function catalogs and is benchmarked against established cosmic web classification methods. Spatial correlations among cosmic web types are explored using 2-point correlation functions. ASTRA's approach to the cosmic web holds promise for enhancing the retrieval of non-standard clustering statistics, thereby advancing the estimation of cosmological parameters. With simplicity, speed, and applicability across various datasets, ASTRA is a valuable tool in the quantitative study of the large-scale structure of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IVa. Classification of manifolds using machine learning: a case study with small toroidal universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean $E_1$ topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic $E_1$ topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if provided enough training data. This work identifies the prospects and the main challenges for developing machine learning techniques that are capable of accurately classifying observationally viable topologies.</description>

      <title>The cosmic trimmer: Black-hole hair in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is altered by cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static black holes in general relativity modified by a linear scalar coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant always carry hair. We show that the same mechanism that creates the hair makes it incompatible with a cosmological horizon. Other scalar-tensor models do not have this problem when time-dependence of the scalar provides a natural matching to cosmology. Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet is particularly rigid and such a scenario does not help. An extra operator makes the theory behave like the other models and the cosmological horizon can be accommodated. The hair, however, is drastically altered.</description>

      <title>Sharp departure beyond post-Newtonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

Abstract: The destruction of clouds by strong shocks and hot winds is the key process responsible for the transp orting of metals and dust from the ISM to the ICM/IGM, and establishing the multiphase structure in and around galaxies. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of this process using two different approaches for tracking the cloud material (gas and dust): the so-called 'colored' fluid, and the Lagrangian (trace) particles. We find that for the clouds in the hot phase ($T&gt;10^5$ K), the two methods produce significantly different mass fractions and velocities of the cloud material. In contrast, the two methods produce similar results for the clouds that are in the warm/cold phases ($T &lt; 10^5$ K). We find that the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability is suppressed in the warm clouds of size $\sim$100 pc and metallicity $Z\gt 0.1 Z_\odot$ due to effective gas cooling. This causes a delay in the destruction of such clouds that are interacting with the hot ICM flow. We demonstrate that the dust particles that are evacuated from their 'parent' clouds to the hot medium show different dynamics when compared to that of the Lagrangian (trace) particles. Our results indicate that the dust grains swept out to the hot gas are destroyed.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from slow phase transitions: a model-building perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) through delayed vacuum decay during slow cosmic first-order phase transitions. Two specific models, the polynomial potential and the real singlet extension of the Standard Model, are used as illustrative examples. Our findings reveal that models with zero-temperature scalar potential barriers are conducive to the realization of this mechanism, as the phase transition duration is extended by the U-shaped Euclidean action. We find that the resulting PBH density is highly sensitive to the barrier height, with abundant PBH formation observed for sufficiently high barriers. Notably, the phase transition needs NOT to be super-strong, and the commonly used exponential nucleation approximation $\Gamma(t)\sim e^{\beta t}$ fails to capture the PBH formation dynamics in such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding mystery of dark matter physics is the lack of direct detection signals to date. We suggest that dark matter is scatophobic: due to a repulsive long-range interaction, it is repelled by objects with a large net scat charge, such as the Earth, and is therefore not able to reach direct detection experiments. This represents the first step in a broader theoretical paradigm that we dub the "anti-anthropic principle."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study primordial electromagnetic fields in effective actions of string theory. In contrast to a conventional scenario of producing primordial electromagnetic fields induced by the axion inflation, we deal with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action as a non-linear generation of Maxwell theory. It turns out that the intensity of generated electromagnetic fields is bounded from above by the string scale which can also be rewritten in terms of supersymmetry breaking scale in the context of type IIB Large Volume Scenario. The instability parameter $\xi$ is constrained by the tadpole cancellation condition of D3-branes and a realization of hierarchy between the string scale and the Hubble scale of inflation.</description>

      <title>A systematic comparison of slow contraction and inflation as mechanisms for solving the homogeneity, isotropy and flatness problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a systematic study, we use an equivalent pair of improved numerical relativity codes based on a tetrad-formulation of the classical Einstein-scalar field equations to examine whether slow contraction or inflation (or both) can resolve the homogeneity, isotropy and flatness problems. Our finding, based on a set of gauge/frame invariant diagnostics, is that slow contraction robustly and rapidly smooths and flattens spacetime beginning from initial conditions that are outside the perturbative regime of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, whereas inflation fails these tests. We present new numerical evidence supporting the conjecture that the combination of ultralocal evolution and an effective equation-of-state with pressure much greater than energy density is the key to having robust and rapid smoothing. The opposite of ultralocality occurs in expanding spacetimes, which is the leading obstruction to smoothing following a big bang.</description>

Abstract: The shortest distance around the Universe through us is unlikely to be much larger than the horizon diameter if microwave background anomalies are due to cosmic topology. We show that observational constraints from the lack of matched temperature circles in the microwave background leave many possibilities for such topologies. We evaluate the detectability of microwave background multipole correlations for sample cases. Searches for topology signatures in observational data over the large space of possible topologies pose a formidable computational challenge.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological models with inflation and those with bounce have their own strengths and weaknesses. Here we construct a model in which a phase of bounce is followed by a viable inflationary phase. This incorporates several advantages of both and hence, is a more viable model for cosmic evolution. We explore scenarios wherein the bouncing phase smoothly transits to an inflationary one, with the pivot scale leaving the Hubble horizon during the latter era, thereby maintaining consistency with observations. Staying within the ambit of Einstein-Hilbert gravity augmented by the inflaton, we ensure a pre-inflationary bounce by introducing a second scalar field that helps engineer the requisite violation of the null energy condition. Potential ghost instabilities can be mitigated by invoking a non-trivial coupling between the two scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to Produce a Density Field with Given Two, Three, and Four-Point Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we show how to produce a 3D density field with a given set of higher-order correlation functions. Our algorithm enables producing any desired two-point, three-point, and four-point functions, including odd-parity for the latter. We note that this algorithm produces the desired correlations about a set of "primary" points, matched to how the spherical-harmonic-based algorithms ENCORE and CADENZA measure them. These "primary points" must be used as those around which the correlation functions are measured. We also outline how to generalize the algorithm to i) N-point correlations with $N&gt;4$, ii) dimensions other than 3, and iii) beyond scalar quantities. This algorithm should find use in verifying analysis pipelines for higher-order statistics in upcoming galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Roman, and Spherex, as well as intensity mapping</description>

      <title>Inflationary models constrained by reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of reheating in inflationary models is crucial for understanding the early universe and gaining insights into inflationary dynamics and parameters. The reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the duration of the reheating phase, quantified by the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, have significant implications for particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. The duration of reheating affects particle abundance, including dark matter, and shapes the primordial power spectrum and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. By combining cosmological observations and theoretical considerations, we can constrain both $T_{re}$ and $N_{re}$, which in turn constrain the spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and inflation model parameters. Utilizing consistency relations among observables, such as $n_s$ and $r$, provides additional constraints on inflationary models and determines bounds for other observables like the running of the scalar spectral index. These bounds are valuable for assessing the viability of models and can serve to specify priors in Bayesian analyses of specific models. As an example of how to proceed, we study in detail a particular case of a generalized $\alpha$-attractor model that accurately reproduces observed quantities. We present equations for the conditions of instantaneous reheating, establish consistency relations, and explore the generalized $\alpha$-attractor model using cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear redshift space distortion in halo ellipticity correlations: Analytical model and N-body simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic model of nonlinear correlators of galaxy/halo ellipticities in redshift space. The three-dimensional ellipticity field is not affected by the redshift-space distortion (RSD) at linear order, but by the nonlinear one, known as the Finger-of-God effect, caused by the coordinate transformation from real to redshift space. Adopting a simple Gaussian damping function to describe the nonlinear RSD effect and the nonlinear alignment model for the relation between the observed ellipticity and underlying tidal fields, we derive analytic formulas for the multipole moments of the power spectra of the ellipticity field in redshift space expanded in not only the associated Legendre basis, a natural basis for the projected galaxy shape field, but also the standard Legendre basis, conventionally used in literature. The multipoles of the corresponding correlation functions of the galaxy shape field are shown to be expressed by a simple Hankel transform, as is the case for those of the conventional galaxy density correlations. We measure these multipoles of the power spectra and correlation functions of the halo ellipticity field using large-volume N-body simulations. We then show that the measured alignment signals can be better predicted by our nonlinear model than the existing linear alignment model. The formulas derived here have already been used to place cosmological constraints using from the redshift-space correlation functions of the galaxy shape field measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Okumura and Taruya, 2023).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections and the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys, a new era in cosmology is unfolding. This study explores the synergies between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys to jointly constrain cosmological and gravitational-wave population parameters. We introduce CHIMERA, a novel code for gravitational-wave cosmology combining information from the population properties of compact binary mergers and galaxy catalogs. We study constraints for scenarios representative of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 and O5 observing runs, assuming to have a complete catalog of potential host galaxies with either spectroscopic or photometric redshift measurements. We find that a percent-level measurement of $H_0$ could be achieved with the best 100 binary black holes in O5 using a spectroscopic galaxy catalog. In this case, the intrinsic correlation that exists between $H_0$ and the binary black hole population mass scales is broken. Instead, by using a photometric catalog the accuracy is degraded up to a factor of $\sim\! 9$, leaving a significant correlation between $H_0$ and the mass scales that must be carefully modeled to avoid bias. Interestingly, we find that using spectroscopic redshift measurements in the O4 configuration yields a better constraint on $H_0$ compared to the O5 configuration with photometric measurements. In view of the wealth of gravitational-wave data that will be available in the future, we argue the importance of obtaining spectroscopic galaxy catalogs to maximize the scientific return of gravitational-wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of discrete tracers of large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonplace in cosmology to analyze fields projected onto the celestial sphere, and in particular density fields that are defined by a set of points e.g. galaxies. When performing an harmonic-space analysis of such data (e.g. an angular power spectrum) using a pixelized map one has to deal with aliasing of small-scale power and pixel window functions. We compare and contrast the approaches to this problem taken in the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure communities, and advocate for a direct approach that avoids pixelization. We describe a method for performing a pseudo-spectrum analysis of a galaxy data set and show that it can be implemented efficiently using well-known algorithms for special functions that are suited to acceleration by graphics processing units (GPUs). The method returns the same spectra as the more traditional map-based approach if in the latter the number of pixels is taken to be sufficiently large and the mask is well sampled. The method is readily generalizable to cross-spectra and higher-order functions. It also provides a convenient route for distributing the information in a galaxy catalog directly in harmonic space, as a complement to releasing the configuration-space positions and weights. We make public a code enabling the application of our method to existing and upcoming datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

Abstract: While the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) has been used as a distance indicator since the early 1990's, its application to measure the Hubble Constant as a primary distance indicator occurred only recently. The TRGB is also currently at an interesting crossroads as results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are beginning to emerge. In this chapter, we provide a review of the TRGB as it is used to measure the Hubble constant. First, we provide an essential review of the physical and observational basis of the TRGB as well as providing a summary for its use for measuring the Hubble Constant. More attention is then given is then given to recent, but still pre-JWST, developments, including new calibrations and developments with algorithms. We also address challenges that arise while measuring a TRGB-based Hubble Constant. We close by looking forward to the exciting prospects from telescopes such as JWST and Gaia.</description>

Abstract: The correlations between T, E modes and B modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which are expected to vanish under parity symmetry, have become a sensitive probe of the new physics beyond the standard model. In this paper, we forecast the estimation of TB and EB cross power spectra using NILC and cILC on AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that, NILC performs better than cILC on TB and EB correlations in light of its lower uncertainties. In terms of the birefringence angle estimation without assuming systematic errors, the combination of CMB TB and EB spectrum from NILC cleaned simulations could reach a sensitivity of $-0.049^\circ&lt;\beta&lt;0.056^\circ$ (95% CL).</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Kodama state by quantizing the theory of General Relativity (GR) with dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity. We find a new exact solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation where the Pontryagin term induces a modification in the Kodama state from quantizing GR alone. The dCS modification directly encodes the variation of the cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We present the final data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project, a precursor to the SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping program. This data set includes 11-year photometric and 7-year spectroscopic light curves for 849 broad-line quasars over a redshift range of 0.1&lt;z&lt;4.5 and a luminosity range of Lbol=1E44-47.5 erg/s, along with spectral and variability measurements. We report 23, 81, 125, and 110 reverberation mapping lags (relative to optical continuum variability) for broad Halpha, Hbeta, MgII and CIV using the SDSS-RM sample, spanning much of the luminosity and redshift ranges of the sample. Using 30 low-redshift RM AGNs with dynamical-modeling black hole masses, we derive a new estimate of the average virial factor of &lt;log f&gt;=0.62+-0.07 for the line dispersion measured from the RMS spectrum. The intrinsic scatter of individual virial factors is 0.31+-0.07 dex, indicating a factor of two systematic uncertainty in RM black hole masses. Our lag measurements reveal significant R-L relations for Hbeta and MgII at high redshift, consistent with the latest measurements based on heterogeneous samples. While we are unable to robustly constrain the slope of the R-L relation for CIV given the limited dynamical range in luminosity, we found substantially larger scatter in CIV lags at fixed L1350. Using the SDSS-RM lag sample, we derive improved single-epoch (SE) mass recipes for Hbeta, MgII and CIV, which are consistent with their respective RM masses as well as between the SE recipes from two different lines, over the luminosity range probed by our sample. The new Hbeta and MgII recipes are approximately unbiased estimators at given RM masses, but there are systematic biases in the CIV recipe. The intrinsic scatter of SE masses around RM masses is ~0.45 dex for Hbeta and MgII, increasing to ~0.58 dex for CIV.</description>

      <title>Screening fifth forces in scalar-vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a screening mechanism in the context of scalar-vector-tensor (SVT) theories. This screening mechanism is based on both the derivative self-interactions of the vector field and the interactions of the scalar field with the vector field and curvature. We calculate the field equations in a spherically symmetric space-time, and then, we study the conditions for which this mechanism is successful in a weak gravitational background. In order to corroborate these analytical results, we have performed a numerical integration of the full equations. Finally, the corrections to the gravitational potentials have also been computed. We conclude that the present model, including both kinds of interactions, can avoid the propagation of the additional longitudinal mode arising in these theories. We also show that the space parameter of the model is compatible with solar system constraints. This result extends the previous one found in the literature for generalized Proca theories to the case of SVT theories in the presence of scalar-vector interactions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on EFT's in an expanding Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find bounds on the Wilson coefficients of effective field theories (EFTs) living in a Universe undergoing expansion by requiring that its modes do not propagate further than a minimally coupled photon by a resolvable amount. To do so, we compute the spatial shift suffered by the EFT modes at a fixed time slice within the WKB approximation and the regime of validity of the EFT. We analyze the bounds arising on shift-symmetric scalars and curved space generalizations of Galileons.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis in nonextensive cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal leptogenesis is a mechanism that explains the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the early universe. In this study, we review the impact of nonextensive Tsallis statistical mechanics on the early universe and study its effect on thermal leptogenesis. The study has found that the use of nonextensive statistical mechanics can affect the production of baryon asymmetry in thermal leptogenesis by modifying the equilibrium abundance of particles, decay, and washout parameters. Also, we show that nonextensive statistical mechanics potentially reduce the required right-handed neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <title>A pilot search for MeV gamma-ray emission from five galaxy clusters using archival COMPTEL data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for MeV gamma-ray emission between 0.75-30 MeV from five galaxy clusters, viz. Coma, VIRGO, SPT-CL J2012-5649, Bullet, and El Gordo, using archival data from the COMPTEL telescope. For this purpose we use three search templates: point source, radial disk and radial Gaussian. We do not detect any signals from Coma, SPT-CL J2012-5649, Bullet and El Gordo clusters with the 95\% c.l. photon energy flux limit $\sim 10^{-10} ~\rm{erg /cm^2/s} $. For VIRGO, we detect a non-zero signal between 0.92 to 1.63 MeV having marginal significance of about $2.5\sigma$, with the observed energy flux $ \sim 10^{-9}~\rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$. However, we do not confirm the previously reported evidence in literature for a gamma-ray line from Coma and VIRGO clusters between 5-7 MeV.</description>
