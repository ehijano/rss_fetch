      <title>A synthetic overview on some known characterizations of Woodin cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief survey comes from the slides of a seminar I gave to philosophy of mathematics students. I will present some different characterizations of Woodin cardinals, including the one obtained by Ernest Schimmerling in [6]. I will try to give to this paper the most self-contained possible structure, also by showing explicitly just the proofs usually leaved to the reader, and giving exact references for the others.</description>

      <title>Some observations on a result by Bialinicki-Birula and Zelazko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in investigating some definitions and assumptions stated in [4], in particular the notions of measurability and atomicity that the two authors used in order to give a representation for multiplicative linear functionals (m.l.f. so on) over the cartesian product of algebras. We want to briefly analyze the result under other strong proper axioms with respect to ZF(C). Some little historical and notational remarks will be given.</description>

      <title>Unification in subsystem J$_2$ of provability logic GLB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize methods, developed by S. Ghilardi, and apply them to a subsystem J$_2$ of bimodal provability logic GLB. We describe projective formulas in J$_2$ in terms of Kripke semantics and prove that logic J$_2$ has finitary unification type. As an application, we show that admissibility problem for J$_2$ is decidable.</description>

      <title>Uniform Preorders and Partial Combinatory Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform preorders are a class of combinatory representations of Set-indexed preorders that generalize Pieter Hofstra's basic relational objects. An indexed preorder is representable by a uniform preorder if and only if it has as generic predicate. We study the $\exists$-completion of indexed preorders on the level of uniform preorders, and identify a combinatory condition (called 'relational completeness') which characterizes those uniform preorders with finite meets whose $\exists$-completions are triposes. The class of triposes obtained this way contains relative realizability triposes, for which we derive a characterization as a fibrational analogue of the characterization of realizability toposes given in earlier work.
  Besides relative partial combinatory algebras, the class of relationally complete uniform preorders contains filtered ordered partial combinatory algebras, and it is unclear if there are any others.</description>

      <title>C-minimal fields have the exchange property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that C-minimal fields (i.e., C-minimal expansions of ACVF) have the exchange property, answering a question of Haskell and Macpherson. Additionally, we strengthen some theorems of Cubides Kovacsics and Delon on C-minimal fields. First, we show that definably complete C-minimal fields of characteristic 0 have generic differentiability. Second, we show that if the induced structure on the residue field is a pure ACF, then polynomial boundedness holds. In fact, polynomial boundedness can only fail if there are unexpected definable automorphisms of the multiplicative group of the residue field.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivalence Relations on Polish Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate natural variations of behaviourally correct learning and explanatory learning -- two learning paradigms studied in algorithmic learning theory -- that allow us to ``learn'' equivalence relations on Polish spaces. We give a characterization of the learnable equivalence relations in terms of their Borel complexity and show that the behaviorally correct and explanatory learnable equivalence relations coincide both in uniform and non-uniform versions of learnability and provide a characterization of the learnable equivalence relations in terms of their Borel complexity. We also show that the set of uniformly learnable equivalence relations is $\pmb\Pi^1_1$-complete in the codes and study the learnability of several equivalence relations arising naturally in logic as a case study.</description>

      <title>Omega-categorical pseudofinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between omega-categoricity and pseudofiniteness for groups, conjecturing that omega-categorical pseudofinite groups are finite-by-abelian-by-finite. We show that the conjecture reduces to nilpotent p-groups of class 2, and give a proof that several of the known examples of omega-categorical p-groups satisfy the conjecture. In particular, we show by a direct counting argument that for any odd prime p the (omega-categorical) model companion of the theory of nilpotent class 2 exponent p groups, constructed by Saracino and Wood, is not pseudofinite, and that an omega-categorical group constructed by Baudisch with supersimple rank 1 theory is not pseudofinite. We also survey some scattered literature on omega-categorical groups over 50 years.</description>

      <title>Proofs that Modify Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give an ordinal analysis of the theory of second order arithmetic. We do this by working with proof trees -- that is, "deductions" which may not be well-founded. Working in a suitable theory, we are able to represent functions on proof trees as yet further proof trees satisfying a suitable analog of well-foundedness. Iterating this process allows us to represent higher order functions as well: since functions on proof trees are just proof trees themselves, these functions can easily be extended to act on proof trees which are themselves understood as functions. The corresponding system of ordinals parallels this, using higher order collapsing function.</description>

      <title>Reduced Products of Collapsing Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits ({\mathbb B})$ denotes the reduced power ${\mathbb B}^\omega /\Phi$ of a Boolean algebra ${\mathbb B}$, where $\Phi$ is the Fr\'{e}chet filter $\Phi$ on $\omega$. We investigate iterated reduced powers ($\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits ^0 ({\mathbb B})={\mathbb B}$ and $\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits ^{n+1} ({\mathbb B} )=\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits (\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits ^n ({\mathbb B}))$) of collapsing algebras and our main intention is to classify the algebras $\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits ^n (\mathop{\rm Col}\nolimits (\lambda ,\kappa))$, $n\in {\mathbb N}$, up to isomorphism of their Boolean completions. In particular, assuming that SCH and ${\mathfrak h} =\omega _1$ hold, we show that for any cardinals $\lambda\geq \omega$ and $\kappa \geq 2$ such that $\kappa\lambda &gt;\omega$ and $\mathop{\rm cf}\nolimits (\lambda )\leq {\mathfrak c}$ we have $\mathop{\rm ro} (\mathop{\rm rp}\nolimits ^n(\mathop{\rm Col}\nolimits (\lambda ,\kappa)))\cong \mathop{\rm Col}\nolimits (\omega _1, (\kappa ^{&lt;\lambda })^\omega )$, for each $n\in {\mathbb N}$. If ${\mathfrak b} ={\mathfrak d}$ and $0^\sharp$ does not exist, then the same holds whenever $\mathop{\rm cf}\nolimits (\lambda )= \omega$.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of P{\l}onka sums into direct systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The P{\l}onka sum is an algebra determined using a structure called a direct system. By a direct system, we mean an indexed family of algebras with disjoint universes whose indexes form a join-semilattice s.t. if two indexes are in a partial order relation, then there is a homomorphism from the algebra of the first index to the algebra of the second index. The sum of the sets of the direct system determines the universe of the P{\l}onka sum. Therefore, to speak about a P{\l}onka sum, there must be a direct system on which this algebra is based. However, we can look at a P{\l}onka sum the other way around, considering it as some given algebra, and ask whether it is possible to determine all direct systems of it systematically.
  In our paper, we will decompose the P{\l}onka sum in such a way as to give a solution to the indicated problem. Moreover, our method works for any algebra of the kind considered in the article, and thus, we can determine if a given algebra is a P{\l}onka sum. The proposed method is based on two concepts introduced in the paper: isolated algebra and P{\l}onka homomorphism.</description>
