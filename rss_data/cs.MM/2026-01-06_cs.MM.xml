      <title>Speak the Art: A Direct Speech to Image Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called \textbf{Speak the Art (STA)} which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Detection with Multi-Artifact Subspace Fine-Tuning and Selective Layer Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake detection still faces significant challenges in cross-dataset and real-world complex scenarios. The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.</description>

      <title>MotiBo: The Impact of Interactive Digital Storytelling Robots on Student Motivation through Self-Determination Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creativity is increasingly recognized as an important skill in education, and storytelling can enhance motivation and engagement among students. However, conventional storytelling methods often lack the interactive elements necessary to engage students. To this end, this study examines the impact of an interactive digital storytelling system incorporating a human-like robot on student engagement and creativity. The study aims to compare engagement levels across three modalities: paper-based, PowerPoint, and robot-assisted storytelling, MotiBo. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, this work involves three groups of students who interact with the storytelling system over a five-day learning. Findings reveal that students using MotiBo exhibit statistically significant improvement in behavioural and cognitive engagement compared to those using traditional methods. These results suggest that the integration of novel technologies can effectively enhance the learning experience, ultimately promoting creativity and self-learning ability in educational settings. Future research will investigate the long-term effects of these technologies on learning outcomes and explore their potential for broader applications in diverse educational contexts.</description>

      <title>IO-RAE: Information-Obfuscation Reversible Adversarial Example for Audio Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly accelerated the adoption of speech recognition technology, leading to its widespread integration across various applications. However, this surge in usage also highlights a critical issue: audio data is highly vulnerable to unauthorized exposure and analysis, posing significant privacy risks for businesses and individuals. This paper introduces an Information-Obfuscation Reversible Adversarial Example (IO-RAE) framework, the pioneering method designed to safeguard audio privacy using reversible adversarial examples. IO-RAE leverages large language models to generate misleading yet contextually coherent content, effectively preventing unauthorized eavesdropping by humans and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Additionally, we propose the Cumulative Signal Attack technique, which mitigates high-frequency noise and enhances attack efficacy by targeting low-frequency signals. Our approach ensures the protection of audio data without degrading its quality or our ability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a targeted misguidance rate of 96.5% and a remarkable 100% untargeted misguidance rate in obfuscating target keywords across multiple ASR models, including a commercial black-box system from Google. Furthermore, the quality of the recovered audio, measured by the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality score, reached 4.45, comparable to high-quality original recordings. Notably, the recovered audio processed by ASR systems exhibited an error rate of 0%, indicating nearly lossless recovery. These results highlight the practical applicability and effectiveness of our IO-RAE framework in protecting sensitive audio privacy.</description>

      <title>LinMU: Multimodal Understanding Made Linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.</description>

      <title>MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Patches: Global-aware Autoregressive Model for Multimodal Few-Shot Font Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual font design is an intricate process that transforms a stylistic visual concept into a coherent glyph set. This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, their application to FFG is constrained by conventional patch-level tokenization, which neglects global dependencies crucial for coherent font synthesis. Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation. GAR-Font introduces a global-aware tokenizer that effectively captures both local structures and global stylistic patterns, a multimodal style encoder offering flexible style control through a lightweight language-style adapter without requiring intensive multimodal pretraining, and a post-refinement pipeline that further enhances structural fidelity and style coherence. Extensive experiments show that GAR-Font outperforms existing FFG methods, excelling in maintaining global style faithfulness and achieving higher-quality results with textual stylistic guidance.</description>

      <title>DDNet: A Dual-Stream Graph Learning and Disentanglement Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of AIGC technology enables misleading viewers by tampering mere small segments within a video, rendering video-level detection inaccurate and unpersuasive. Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features. Experiments on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 9\% in AP@0.95, with significant improvements in cross-domain robustness.</description>

      <title>Pedagogical Reflections on the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) Framework and AI-Augmented Learning in Creative Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an expanded account of the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) framework for reflective and creative learning in computing education. The HCD framework integrates design thinking, experiential learning, and reflective practice into a unified constructivist pedagogy emphasizing autonomy, ownership, and scaffolding. It is applied across courses in game design (CS3247, CS4350), virtual reality (CS4240), and extended reality systems, where students engage in iterative cycles of thinking, creating, criticizing, and reflecting. The paper also examines how AI-augmented systems such as iReflect, ReflexAI, and Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM feedback tools operationalize the HCD framework through scalable, personalized feedback. Empirical findings demonstrate improved reflective depth, feedback quality, and learner autonomy. The work advocates a balance of supportive autonomy in supervision, where students practice self-directed inquiry while guided through structured reflection and feedback.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Blind Video Quality Assessment with Rich Quality-aware Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) is a highly challenging task due to the intrinsic complexity of video content and visual distortions, especially given the high popularity of social media videos, which originate from a wide range of sources, and are often processed by various compression and enhancement algorithms. While recent BVQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA) studies have made remarkable progress, their models typically perform well on the datasets they were trained on but generalize poorly to unseen videos, making them less effective for accurately evaluating the perceptual quality of diverse social media videos. In this paper, we propose Rich Quality-aware features enabled Video Quality Assessment (RQ-VQA), a simple yet effective method to enhance BVQA by leveraging rich quality-aware features extracted from off-the-shelf BIQA and BVQA models. Our approach exploits the expertise of existing quality assessment models within their trained domains to improve generalization. Specifically, we design a multi-source feature framework that integrates:(1) Learnable spatial features} from a base model fine-tuned on the target VQA dataset to capture domain-specific quality cues; (2) Temporal motion features from the fast pathway of SlowFast pre-trained on action recognition datasets to model motion-related distortions; (3) Spatial quality-aware features from BIQA models trained on diverse IQA datasets to enhance frame-level distortion representation; and (4) Spatiotemporal quality-aware features from a BVQA model trained on large-scale VQA datasets to jointly encode spatial structure and temporal dynamics. These features are concatenated and fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public social media VQA datasets.</description>

Abstract: pyAMPACT (Python-based Automatic Music Performance Analysis and Comparison Toolkit) links symbolic and audio music representations to facilitate score-informed estimation of performance data in audio as well as general linking of symbolic and audio music representations with a variety of annotations. pyAMPACT can read a range of symbolic formats and can output note-linked audio descriptors/performance data into MEI-formatted files. The audio analysis uses score alignment to calculate time-frequency regions of importance for each note in the symbolic representation from which to estimate a range of parameters. These include tuning-, dynamics-, and timbre-related performance descriptors, with timing-related information available from the score alignment. Beyond performance data estimation, pyAMPACT also facilitates multi-modal investigations through its infrastructure for linking symbolic representations and annotations to audio.</description>

      <title>TraveLLaMA: A Multimodal Travel Assistant with Large-Scale Dataset and Structured Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tourism and travel planning increasingly rely on digital assistance, yet existing multimodal AI systems often lack specialized knowledge and contextual understanding of urban environments. We present TraveLLaMA, a specialized multimodal language model designed for comprehensive travel assistance. Our work addresses the fundamental challenge of developing practical AI travel assistants through three key contributions: (1) TravelQA, a novel dataset of 265k question-answer pairs combining 160k text QA from authentic travel sources, 100k vision-language QA featuring maps and location imagery, and 5k expert-annotated Chain-of-Thought reasoning examples; (2) Travel-CoT, a structured reasoning framework that decomposes travel queries into spatial, temporal, and practical dimensions, improving answer accuracy by 10.8\% while providing interpretable decision paths; and (3) an interactive agent system validated through extensive user studies. Through fine-tuning experiments on state-of-the-art vision-language models (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, Shikra), we achieve 6.2-9.4\% base improvements, further enhanced by Travel-CoT reasoning. Our model demonstrates superior capabilities in contextual travel recommendations, map interpretation, and scene understanding while providing practical information such as operating hours and cultural insights. User studies with 500 participants show TraveLLaMA achieves a System Usability Scale score of 82.5, significantly outperforming general-purpose models and establishing new standards for multimodal travel assistance systems.</description>

      <title>MIND Your Reasoning: A Meta-Cognitive Intuitive-Reflective Network for Dual-Reasoning in Multimodal Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) is a crucial task for understanding public opinion on social media. Existing methods predominantly operate by learning to fuse modalities. They lack an explicit reasoning process to discern how inter-modal dynamics, such as irony or conflict, collectively shape the user's final stance, leading to frequent misjudgments. To address this, we advocate for a paradigm shift from *learning to fuse* to *learning to reason*. We introduce **MIND**, a **M**eta-cognitive **I**ntuitive-reflective **N**etwork for **D**ual-reasoning. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, MIND operationalizes a self-improving loop. It first generates a rapid, intuitive hypothesis by querying evolving Modality and Semantic Experience Pools. Subsequently, a meta-cognitive reflective stage uses Modality-CoT and Semantic-CoT to scrutinize this initial judgment, distill superior adaptive strategies, and evolve the experience pools themselves. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our MIND significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization.</description>

Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods. The model and dataset are open-sourced at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/AHA.</description>
