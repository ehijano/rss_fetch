      <title>Reducing Profile-Based Matching to the Maximum Weight Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The profile-based matching problem is the problem of finding a matching that optimizes profile from an instance $(G, r, \langle u_1, \dots, u_r \rangle)$, where $G$ is a bipartite graph $(A \cup B, E)$, $r$ is the number of utility functions, and $u_i: E \to \{ 0, 1, \dots, U_i \}$ is utility functions for $1 \le i \le r$. A matching is optimal if the matching maximizes the sum of the 1st utility, subject to this, maximizes the sum of the 2nd utility, and so on. The profile-based matching can express rank-maximal matching \cite{irving2006rank}, fair matching \cite{huang2016fair}, and weight-maximal matching \cite{huang2012weight}. These problems can be reduced to maximum weight matching problems, but the reduction is known to be inefficient due to the huge weights.
  This paper presents the condition for a weight function to find an optimal matching by reducing profile-based matching to the maximum weight matching problem. It is shown that a weight function which represents utilities as a mixed-radix numeric system with base-$(2U_i+1)$ can be used, so the complexity of the problem is $O(m\sqrt{n}(\log{n} + \sum_{i=1}^{r}\log{U_i}))$ for $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$. In addition, it is demonstrated that the weight lower bound for rank-maximal/fair/weight-maximal matching, better computational complexity for fair/weight-maximal matching, and an algorithm to verify a maximum weight matching can be reduced to rank-maximal matching. Finally, the effectiveness of the profile-based algorithm is evaluated with real data for school choice lottery.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BHR (Buratti-Horak-Rosa) Conjecture (2006) proposes that for every p and a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers modulo p, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the Complete Graph Kp with consecutive edge lengths given by the elements of L. In this article, we outline an approach to the conjecture based on frequency partitions and local/global adjustment operations and backtracking. We describe the mathematical strategy, experimental evidence, and implementation in a Python Program to explore valid Hamiltonian paths p &lt; 37. This is a result an improvement over by Mariusz Meszka for all primes up to 23 (included) with the aid of a computer.</description>

      <title>$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin ''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs (DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization of their Markov equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of covering regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph covering projection, also referred to as a locally bijective homomorphism, is a mapping between the vertices and edges of two graphs that preserves incidences and is a local bijection. This concept originates in topological graph theory but has also found applications in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. In this paper we consider undirected graphs in the most general setting -- graphs may contain multiple edges, loops, and semi-edges. This is in line with recent trends in topological graph theory and mathematical physics.
  We advance the study of the computational complexity of the {\sc $H$-Cover} problem, which asks whether an input graph allows a covering projection onto a parameter graph $H$. The quest for a complete characterization started in 1990's. Several results for simple graphs or graphs without semi-edges have been known, the role of semi-edges in the complexity setting has started to be investigated only recently. One of the most general known NP-hardness results states that {\sc $H$}-Cover is NP-complete for every simple connected regular graph of valency greater than two. We complement this result by considering regular graphs $H$ arising from connected acyclic graphs by adding semi-edges. Namely, we prove that any graph obtained by adding semi-edges to the vertices of a tree making it a $d$-regular graph with $d \geq 3$, defines an NP-complete graph covering problem. In line with the so called Strong Dichotomy Conjecture, we prove that the NP-hardness holds even for simple graphs on input.</description>

      <title>Temporal Orienteering with Changing Fuel Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem Orienteering asks whether there exists a walk which visits a number of sites without exceeding some fuel budget. In the variant of the problem we consider, the cost of each edge in the walk is dependent on the time we depart one endpoint and the time we arrive at the other endpoint. This mirrors applications such as travel between orbiting objects where fuel costs are dependent on both the departure time and the length of time spent travelling. In defining this problem, we introduce a natural generalisation of the standard notion of temporal graphs: the pair consisting of the graph of the sites and a cost function, in which costs as well as shortest travel times between pairs of objects change over time. We believe this model is likely to be of independent interest. The problem of deciding whether a stated goal is feasible is easily seen to be NP-complete; we investigate three different ways to restrict the input which lead to efficient algorithms. These include the number of times an edge can be used, an analogue of vertex-interval-membership width, and the number of sites to be visited.</description>

      <title>Compact Representation of Semilinear and Terrain-like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the existence and construction of \textit{biclique covers} of graphs, consisting of coverings of their edge sets by complete bipartite graphs. The \textit{size} of such a cover is the sum of the sizes of the bicliques. Small-size biclique covers of graphs are ubiquitous in computational geometry, and have been shown to be useful compact representations of graphs. We give a brief survey of classical and recent results on biclique covers and their applications, and give new families of graphs having biclique covers of near-linear size.
  In particular, we show that semilinear graphs, whose edges are defined by linear relations in bounded dimensional space, always have biclique covers of size $O(n\polylog n)$. This generalizes many previously known results on special classes of graphs including interval graphs, permutation graphs, and graphs of bounded boxicity, but also new classes such as intersection graphs of L-shapes in the plane. It also directly implies the bounds for Zarankiewicz's problem derived by Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran (\textit{Forum Math. Sigma}, 2021).
  We also consider capped graphs, also known as terrain-like graphs, defined as ordered graphs forbidding a certain ordered pattern on four vertices. Terrain-like graphs contain the induced subgraphs of terrain visibility graphs. We give an elementary proof that these graphs admit biclique partitions of size $O(n\log^3 n)$. This provides a simple combinatorial analogue of a classical result from Agarwal, Alon, Aronov, and Suri on polygon visibility graphs (\textit{Discrete Comput. Geom.} 1994).
  Finally, we prove that there exists families of unit disk graphs on $n$ vertices that do not admit biclique coverings of size $o(n^{4/3})$, showing that we are unlikely to improve on Szemer\'edi-Trotter type incidence bounds for higher-degree semialgebraic graphs.</description>

      <title>Faces in rectilinear drawings of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of extremal problems about faces in convex rectilinear drawings of~$K_n$, that is, drawings where vertices are represented by points in the plane in convex position and edges by line segments between the points representing the end-vertices. We show that if a convex rectilinear drawing of $K_n$ does not contain a common interior point of at least three edges, then there is always a face forming a convex 5-gon while there are such drawings without any face forming a convex $k$-gon with $k \geq 6$.
  A convex rectilinear drawing of $K_n$ is \emph{regular} if its vertices correspond to vertices of a regular convex $n$-gon. We characterize positive integers $n$ for which regular drawings of $K_n$ contain a face forming a convex 5-gon.
  To our knowledge, this type of problems has not been considered in the literature before and so we also pose several new natural open problems.</description>

      <title>Inverse matroid optimization under subset constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Inverse Matroid problem, we are given a matroid, a fixed basis $B$, and an initial weight function, and the goal is to minimally modify the weights -- measured by some function -- so that $B$ becomes a maximum-weight basis. The problem arises naturally in settings where one wishes to explain or enforce a given solution by minimally perturbing the input.
  We extend this classical problem by replacing the fixed basis with a subset $S_0$ of the ground set and imposing various structural constraints on the set of maximum-weight bases relative to $S_0$. Specifically, we study six variants: (A) Inverse Matroid Exists, where $S_0$ must contain at least one maximum-weight basis; (B) Inverse Matroid All, where all bases contained in $S_0$ are maximum-weight; and (C) Inverse Matroid Only, where $S_0$ contains exactly the maximum-weight bases, along with their natural negated counterparts.
  For all variants, we develop combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms under the $\ell_\infty$-norm. A key ingredient is a refined min-max theorem for Inverse Matroid under the $\ell_\infty$-norm, which enables simpler and faster algorithms than previous approaches and may be of independent combinatorial interest. Our work significantly broadens the range of inverse optimization problems on matroids that can be solved efficiently, especially those that constrain the structure of optimal solutions through subset inclusion or exclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the model of limited visibility Cops and Robbers, where the cops can only see within their $l$-neighbourhood. We prove that the number of cops needed to see the robber can be arbitrarily smaller than the number needed to capture the robber, answering an open question from the literature. We then consider how close we can get to seeing the robber when we do not have enough cops, along with a probabilistic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Distribution of codewords on the faces of a hypercube and new combinatorial identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for studying combinatorial identities through the geometric lens of subset distributions in q-valued cubes. By analyzing how elements of arbitrary subsets are distributed among the faces of the cube E_q^n, we discover new combinatorial identities with geometric significance. We prove that for any subset A contained in E_2^n, the rank function satisfies refined bounds that lead to exact computations for small cardinalities. Specifically, we show that for odd cardinalities, the lower bound is 4D_A/(|A|^2-1) where D_A is the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances in A. Our main theorem establishes identities connecting the number of k-dimensional faces containing exactly e elements of a subset to binomial sums over all subsets of specified cardinality. This yields a parametric family of identities where classical results emerge as special cases. As applications, we derive a geometric interpretation of Vandermonde's identity by examining faces of q-valued cubes, revealing that this classical result naturally arises from counting element distributions. We also obtain a completely new identity for even-weight vectors: (2^(k-1) - 1) times 2^(n-1) times binomial(n,k) equals the sum over i from 1 to floor(n/2) of binomial(n,2i) times binomial(n-2i,k-2i). This identity, valid for all 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n, demonstrates how geometric perspectives can uncover hidden combinatorial relationships. Our framework provides a unified approach for generating new identities and understanding existing ones through subset rank analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantifying analogy of concepts via ologs and wiring diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the theory of ontology logs (ologs) created by Spivak and Kent, and define a notion of wiring diagrams. In this article, a wiring diagram is a finite directed labelled graph. The labels correspond to types in an olog; they can also be interpreted as readings of sensors in an autonomous system. As such, wiring diagrams can be used as a framework for an autonomous system to form abstract concepts. We show that the graphs underlying skeleton wiring diagrams form a category. This allows skeleton wiring diagrams to be compared and manipulated using techniques from both graph theory and category theory. We also extend the usual definition of graph edit distance to the case of wiring diagrams by using operations only available to wiring diagrams, leading to a metric on the set of all skeleton wiring diagrams. In the end, we give an extended example on calculating the distance between two concepts represented by wiring diagrams, and explain how to apply our framework to any application domain.</description>

      <title>Unbent Collections of Orthogonal Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple drawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed collections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due to the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on 4-graphs, that is, graphs of maximum degree 4. We restrict ourselves to plane graphs, that is, planar graphs whose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an unbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that adhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn without bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives. First, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection. We prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at most three drawings, which is tight. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size $2$. Second, we consider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent collection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation algorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how to compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.</description>

Abstract: Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</description>
