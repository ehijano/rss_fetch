      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Portfolio of Assets with Extreme Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a portfolio of crypto assets that does not respond well to multivariate autoregressive models because of discontinuity in conditional covariance matrix and posterior covariance matrix caused by extreme liquidity. We adjust asset-level return and volatility with liquidity to reduce such discontinuity, and restore the effectiveness of a set of liquidity-adjusted VECM-DCC/ADCC-BL models at extreme liquidity. We establish two distinctive yet complementary portfolio liquidity measures: portfolio liquidity jump that quantifies the effect of liquidity adjustment in forecasting the conditional covariance matrix, and portfolio liquidity diffusion that quantifies the effect of liquidity adjustment in estimating the posterior covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Volatility Estimation with Fast Multiple Change Points Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing sparse high-frequency volatility estimators that are robust against change points in the spot volatility process. The estimators we propose are $\ell_1$-regularized versions of existing volatility estimators. We focus on power variation estimators as they represent a fundamental class of volatility estimators. We establish consistency of these estimators for the true unobserved volatility and the change points locations, showing that minimax rates can be achieved for particular volatility estimators. The new estimators utilize the computationally efficient least angle regression algorithm for estimation purposes, followed by a reduced dynamic programming step to refine the final number of change points. In terms of numerical performance, these estimators are not only computationally fast but also accurately identify breakpoints near the end of the sample, both features highly desirable in today's electronic trading environment. In terms of out-of-sample volatility prediction, our new estimators provide more realistic and smoother volatility forecasts, outperforming a broad range of classical and recent volatility estimators across various frequencies and forecasting horizons.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear shifts and dislocations in financial market structure and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops new mathematical techniques to identify temporal shifts among a collection of US equities partitioned into a new and more detailed set of market sectors. Although conceptually related, our three analyses reveal distinct insights about financial markets, with meaningful implications for investment managers. First, we explore a variety of methods to identify nonlinear shifts in market sector structure and describe the mathematical connection between the measure used and the captured phenomena. Second, we study network structure with respect to our new market sectors and identify meaningfully connected sector-to-sector mappings. Finally, we conduct a series of sampling experiments over different sample spaces and contrast the distribution of Sharpe ratios produced by long-only, long-short and short-only investment portfolios. In addition, we examine the sector composition of the top-performing portfolios for each of these portfolio styles. In practice, the methods proposed in this paper could be used to identify regime shifts, optimally structured portfolios, and better communities of equities.</description>

      <title>Elicitability and identifiability of tail risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tail risk measures are fully determined by the distribution of the underlying loss beyond its quantile at a certain level, with Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall being prime examples. They are induced by law-based risk measures, called their generators, evaluated on the tail distribution. This paper establishes joint identifiability and elicitability results of tail risk measures together with the corresponding quantile, provided that their generators are identifiable and elicitable, respectively. As an example, we establish the joint identifiability and elicitability of the tail expectile together with the quantile. The corresponding consistent scores constitute a novel class of weighted scores, nesting the known class of scores of Fissler and Ziegel for the Expected Shortfall together with the quantile. For statistical purposes, our results pave the way to easier model fitting for tail risk measures via regression and the generalized method of moments, but also model comparison and model validation in terms of established backtesting procedures.</description>

      <title>An empirical study of market risk factors for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study examines whether fama-french equity factors can effectively explain the idiosyncratic risk and return characteristics of Bitcoin. By incorporating Fama-french factors, the explanatory power of these factors on Bitcoin's excess returns over various moving average periods is tested through applications of several statistical methods. The analysis aims to determine if equity market factors are significant in explaining and modeling systemic risk in Bitcoin.</description>
