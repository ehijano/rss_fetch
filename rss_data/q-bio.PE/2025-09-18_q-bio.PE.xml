      <title>A generative model of function growth explains hidden self-similarities across biological and social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Modelling species distributions using remote sensing predictors: Comparing Dynamic Habitat Index and LULC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in \^Ile-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects. These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Cumulant Extension of Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question in evolutionary biology is how to quantitatively understand the dynamics of genetically diverse populations. Modeling the genotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all correlations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations between alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium -- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks down under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak recombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to order $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($&gt;K$) are assumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a general equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the standard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant dynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a geometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes. Our analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant dynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or fourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We also applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal sequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable approximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing complexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants.</description>
