      <title>Shell formation and two-dimensional nanofriction in three-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03833v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organized three-dimensional (3D) ion Coulomb crystals in linear Paul traps naturally form concentric shells that provide a curved, atomically resolved interface for studying two-dimensional (2D) nanofriction. Building on prior work that used 2D ion crystals to investigate one-dimensional (1D) nanofriction and orientational melting, we leverage this foundation to extend friction studies from linear ion chains and planar rings to 3D shell structures. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we first map shell formation as a function of ion number $N$ and the trapping aspect ratio, yielding a simple relation that can aid ion-number estimation in experiments. We compute a Peierls--Nabarro-type energy landscape for the rotation of the outer shell against the inner core, showing drastic changes in the effective energy barrier up to a factor of about 60 with only small changes in $N$. Using dynamical simulations, we apply rotational torques to the outer shell of selected systems and show that small changes in $N$ impact the commensurability between shells and can, in some cases, induce a hysteretic response due to torque-induced metastable states. We find that spatially varying coupling to the inner-core corrugation can create coexisting fast and slow moving domains within the rotating outer shell, realizing multidimensional friction where intra-shell shear and inter-shell nanofriction act simultaneously. Our results have implications for stabilizing many-body systems and for the development of ultra-low-friction nanomechanical devices such as ion-based nanorotors and torque sensors.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Raman Velocity Filter in Collinear Laser Spectroscopy: Towards Applications for sub-ppm High-Voltage Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman transitions have a wide range of applications in atomic physics and have recently been proposed as a means for improving high-precision high-voltage measurements. Here, we present a theoretical analysis and a first experimental demonstration of $5s\,^2\mathrm{S}_{1/2} \rightarrow 4d\,^2\mathrm{D}_{3/2,5/2}$ Raman transitions in $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions in collinear laser spectroscopy. For the theoretical description the three-level system is reduced to an effective two-level system, in order to estimate the experimental parameters, while the role of the spatial laser intensity distribution in combination with the radial extension of the ion beam are elucidated by performing simulations of the full four-level system. Experimentally, we realized the first velocity-selective Raman transition in collinear laser spectroscopy. Using a $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion beam, we demonstrate a reduction in the energy width to less than $200\,$meV, which is about an order of magnitude reduction compared to the usage of an optical dipole transition as in previous works. We also investigate two-photon Rabi oscillations and show that their observed collapse is consistent with the simulations.</description>

      <title>Progress in quantum metrology and applications for optical atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement offers powerful opportunities for enhancing measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits, with optical atomic clocks serving as a leading platform for such advances. This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Errors in PDH offset locking due to spurious spectral features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is widely used to stabilize the frequency of lasers. Here we report on a routinely underestimated source of error in PDH offset-locking: a shift in the lock point due to the unintended interaction between residual optical sidebands and higher-order spatial modes in misaligned Fabry-Perot cavities. Significant frequency deviations-up to 50% of the cavity linewidth-can arise when the optical offset is obtained from a sinusoidally driven EOM. We measure this deviation experimentally, find agreement with a simple model, and show how a spectrally-pure frequency offset can reduce the deviation by an order of magnitude. Our findings draw attention to a systematic effect of importance to precision optical spectroscopy, optical clocks, and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Photon Correlations in Trapped Ion Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Optical nuclear electric resonance as single qubit gate for trapped neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single-qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$~$^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$~5s5p~$^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that spin-flip operations exceeding 99.9\% fidelity can be performed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Single Qudit Control in $^{87}$Sr via Optical Nuclear Electric Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in $^{87}$Sr. Here, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that ONER can be extended to single-qudit control, addressing multiple one-level hyperfine transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear-spin manifold. We identify suitable operating regimes and show that ONER enables high-fidelity spin manipulations, with simulated $\pi$-gate fidelities exceeding 99.9\%, while maintaining coherence under realistic parameter fluctuations. These results establish a proof-of-principle for optical qudit control in $^{87}$Sr and delineate practical parameter ranges for future experiments, highlighting ONER as a promising pathway toward high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>
