      <title>Temperature Dependent Emission Polarization of GaN Defect Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaN defect-based quantum emitters are promising candidates for quantum information technologies, although their underlying nature remains elusive. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms responsible for this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.</description>

      <title>Optical levitation of fluorescent silicon carbide nanoparticles in vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics is an emerging field in quantum science that explores the quantum motion of mesoscopic particles levitated in a vacuum. Expanding this approach to particles with intrinsic quantum defects opens new opportunities for quantum sensing and nontrivial quantum state generation. Here, we explore silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles as a promising platform that offers a range of controllable quantum defects and material tunability. We demonstrate stable optical levitation of 3C-polytype SiC nanoparticles containing single photon emitters in a vacuum. We observe stable fluorescence from the levitated particle, confirming the preservation of the emitters in the levitated state. We also investigate particle loss at low pressure and explore thermal annealing as a potential method to improve trapping stability. Our results establish SiC as a viable platform for levitated optomechanics, providing additional quantum degrees of freedom and material engineering capabilities.</description>

      <title>Light-based electron aberration corrector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving atomic resolution in electron microscopy has historically been hindered by spherical aberration, a fundamental limitation of conventional electron lenses. Its correction typically requires complex assemblies of electromagnetic multipoles. Here, we demonstrate that spherical aberration in a cylindrically symmetric electron lens can be fully compensated via interaction with a shaped light field. By analyzing distortions in high-magnification point-projection electron images of optical standing waves, we quantify the spherical aberration before and after light-induced correction. This approach introduces a new paradigm for optical control in electron beam shaping and opens a pathway towards compact and tunable light-based aberration correctors for high-resolution electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Flatband Dispersion in Bilayer Moir\'e Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the photonic dispersion in one-dimensional moir\'e structures formed by stacking two photonic crystal slabs with slightly different periods, separated by a carefully controlled subwavelength optical spacer. Angle-resolved reflectivity measurements reveal moir\'e bands arising from the interplay between intra- and inter-layer coupling mechanisms of guided modes mediated by the moir\'e superlattice corrugation. By precisely adjusting the refractive index contrast through the filling factor of the photonic crystals, we continuously tune intralayer coupling while keeping interlayer coupling constant. Consequently, we experimentally demonstrate the evolution of moir\'e minibands into flatbands characterized by minimal dispersion bandwidth. All experimental results show good agreement with numerical simulations. Our findings not only confirm theoretical predictions but also provide a practical approach for realizing photonic flatbands in silicon-based moir\'e superlattices operating in the telecom wavelength range. This work paves the way toward harnessing flatband physics in advanced optoelectronic applications such as lasers and optical sensors.</description>

      <title>Optical spatiotemporal Fourier synthesis: Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier synthesis is one of the foundations of physical optics. Spatial Fourier optics is a basis for understanding optical imaging, microscopy, and holography. In conventional Fourier optics, the complex spatial field distribution in the Fourier plane constitutes the spatial spectrum of the field to be realized in physical space. Analogously, in temporal Fourier optics the complex temporal spectrum can be manipulated for ultrafast pulse-shaping. We present here a tutorial on the emerging field of spatiotemporal Fourier optics whereby the spatial and temporal spectra are manipulated jointly to produce spatiotemporally structured optical fields that display unique propagation characteristics. In this tutorial, we focus on a subset of the overall class of non-separable spatiotemporally structured fields; namely, cylindrically symmetric fields in which each radial spatial frequency is associated with a single wavelength. This subset of fields comprises propagation-invariant wave packets that travel rigidly in linear media at a tunable group velocity, and includes space-time wave packets and other closely related structured fields. We describe a spatiotemporal Fourier synthesis system capable of preparing arbitrary optical fields belonging to this subclass.</description>

      <title>The Radiation Pressure of Light: historical perspectives and the role of structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light, or electromagnetic radiation, is well known to possess momentum, and the exchange of this momentum with a reflecting surface leads to radiation pressure. More often than not, it is the radiation pressure generated by a plane wave incident on a flat mirror that is considered. The last few decades have seen the emergence of structured light beams that may possess a complex phase and amplitude structure in both their transverse and longitudinal directions. This paper provides a historical overview of radiation pressure, tracing its discovery and experimental validation, and examines how transitioning to structured light from a plane wave can influence it. In particular, we elucidate the difference in radiation pressure force for structured light fields and how this differs from that of a plane wave at an identical frequency. In particular, the well-known Gouy phase is shown to contribute to a reduction in the radiation pressure force exerted on a flat mirror in comparison to a plane wave for both HG and LG modes. As an illustrative example, we compute that the radiation pressure force for LG modes differs from that of a plane wave by approximately $20$ fN/W for each unit of orbital angular momentum. A detailed experimental proposal to quantify this variance in radiation pressure is described, and we demonstrate that this measurement is within the realm of current metrological techniques.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical bistability of two-dimensional tilted Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of controlling the light by light known as the optical bistability for the two-dimensional tilted Dirac system. Using the Boltzmann approach under relaxation time approximation, we find that the optical bistability can be controlled by the nonlinear response of the system. For the prototype, we consider an inversion symmetry broken system. We find that the optical bistability associated with the nonlinear response is tunable with the strength of the tilt, gap and chemical potential. This suggests the inputs for the development of future-generation optical devices.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Assisted Adaptive Quantum Phase Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging employs the nonclassical correlation of photons to break through the noise limitation of classical imaging, realizing high sensitivity, high SNR imaging and multifunctional image processing. To enhance the flexibility and imaging performance of the optical systems, metasurfaces composed of subwavelength structural units provide a powerful optimization approach, enabling advanced applications in quantum state modulation and high-precision imaging. Conventional phase contrast imaging is fundamentally constrained by its single-phase modulation scheme, precluding adaptive switching between imaging modalities. Therefore, the development of high-contrast imaging techniques that can be used in any combination of phases has been a challenge in the field of optical imaging. Here, we propose a novel imaging scheme combining a polarization-entangled light source and a polarization multiplexed metasurface, which realizes remotely switchable bright-dark phase contrast imaging, demonstrating the flexibility and high integration of the system. Experiments show the system can realize high contrast and high SNR imaging under low phase gradient conditions (phase difference as low as {\pi}/5) and exhibit excellent phase resolution. In addition, the system is suitable for imaging biological samples under low-throughput light conditions, providing an efficient and non-destructive shooting solution for biomedical imaging and promoting the development of phase-sensitive imaging technology.</description>

      <title>FiberKAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Nonlinear Fiber Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery and dynamic characterization of the physical system play a critical role in understanding, learning, and modeling the physical phenomena and behaviors in various fields. Although theories and laws of many system dynamics have been derived from rigorous first principles, there are still a considerable number of complex dynamics that have not yet been discovered and characterized, which hinders the progress of science in corresponding fields. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence for science (AI4S) has emerged as a burgeoning research field. In this paper, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based AI4S framework named FiberKAN is proposed for scientific discovery and dynamic characterization of nonlinear fiber optics. Unlike the classic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure, the trainable and transparent activation functions in KAN make the network have stronger physical interpretability and nonlinear characterization abilities. Multiple KANs are established for fiber-optic system dynamics under various physical effects. Results show that KANs can well discover and characterize the explicit, implicit, and non-analytical solutions under different effects, and achieve better performance than MLPs with the equivalent scale of trainable parameters. Moreover, the effectiveness, computational cost, interactivity, noise resistance, transfer learning ability, and comparison between related algorithms in fiber-optic systems are also studied and analyzed. This work highlights the transformative potential of KAN, establishing it as a pioneering paradigm in AI4S that propels advancements in nonlinear fiber optics, and fosters groundbreaking innovations across a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Long-range quantum entanglement in dielectric mu-near-zero metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is paramount in quantum information processing. Many quantum systems suffer from spatial decoherence in distances over a wavelength and cannot be sustained over short time periods due to dissipation. However, long range solutions are required for the development of quantum information processing on chip. Photonic reservoirs mediating the interactions between qubits and their environment are suggested. Recent research takes advantage of extended wavelength inside near-zero refractive index media to solve the long-range problem along with less sensitivity on the position of quantum emitters. However, those recent proposals use plasmonic epsilon near-zero waveguides that are intrinsically lossy. Here, we propose a fully dielectric platform, compatible with the Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) diamond centers on-chip technology, to drastically improve the range of entanglement over 17 free-space wavelengths, or approximatively 12.5 microns, using mu near-zero metamaterials. We evaluate transient and steady state concurrence demonstrating an order of magnitude enhancement compared to previous works. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a long distance is reported using this strategy. Moreover, value of the zero time delay second order correlation function g_12^((2)) (0) are provided, showing antibunching signature correlated with a high degree of concurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19166v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we first provided a brief overview of cellulose structures, categorizing various types of nanocellulose based on their production methods, and discussed different photonic structures such as cholesteric phases, photonic crystals, distributed Bragg reflectors, and inverse photonic structures. We then reviewed some models that predict optical properties, including refractive index, scattering, reflection, and birefringence, highlighting factors that can influence these properties, such as electric field, surface roughness, temperature, and density, among others. Following this, we explored recent advancements in predicting optical properties, particularly the use of AI-driven algorithms to enhance the prediction of optical behaviors in nanomaterials. Finally, we provided an in-depth discussion of the latest developments in nonlinear optical phenomena and chiroptical responses in nanocellulose-based materials, focusing on circularly polarized luminescence, structural colors, structural correlations, the impact of enantiomers, and more.</description>

      <title>High-contrast scattering microscopy in thick tissue with back-illumination interference tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tissues are composed of discrete compartments of biochemical media that often exhibit subtle differences in refractive index. Light propagating through these compartments partially diffracts in a forward direction with a pi/2 phase shift. We introduce a microscopy technique to image this scattering signal in thick tissues, called back-illumination interference tomography (BIT). An incoherent source is demagnified and imaged past the focal plane of a high numerical aperture objective lens, producing a small, semicoherent source of backscattered light. This backscattered light undergoes a phase inversion over the narrow depth of field of the microscope, providing interference contrast to weakly scattering objects at the focal plane. BIT offers a fundamentally different source of contrast to conventional illumination and oblique back-illumination microscopy. Compared to these techniques, we show that BIT improves contrast to blood cells in vitro in microfluidic chambers and in vivo in a human capillary. Finally, we apply BIT to unstained, unlabeled bulk human tissue ex vivo and compare side-by-side to adjacent frozen sections stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. These results demonstrate the potential of BIT to provide high resolution, high speed, 3D imaging of unprocessed biological tissues.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional SVD-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.</description>

      <title>Ultra High-Q tunable microring resonators enabled by slow light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Q nanophotonic resonators are crucial for many applications in classical and quantum optical processing, communication, sensing, and more. We achieve ultra-high quality factors by preparing a highly transparent and strongly dispersive medium within a resonator, causing a reduction in the group velocity that leads to a nearly three order of magnitude increase in the quality factor. We implement this via spectral hole burning in erbium-doped thin-film lithium niobate microring resonators, and show Q-factors exceeding $10^8$. Additionally, we show that the interplay between the spectrally narrowed resonance and the broader bare resonance produces a Fano lineshape, which we dynamically control via electro-optic tuning. Finally, we present a theoretical model for our experimentally observed resonator linewidths, which are not well-described by the standard Bloch equations. Our results show a dramatic reduction in the erbium dephasing rate under a strong optical drive, leading to much narrower linewidths than would otherwise be expected given the large circulating intensity in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Integration of hBN Single-Photon Emitters on SiN Waveguides via Femtosecond Laser Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a post-fabrication method that deterministically integrates hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) single-photon emitters (SPEs) onto silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides. Mechanically exfoliated hBN flakes are dry-transferred onto pre-fabricated SiN waveguides, and localized femtosecond laser irradiation is employed to induce defects with sub-microscale spatial precision. Confocal photoluminescence mapping reveals multiple laser-written bright defects, among which one emitter exhibits narrow spectral linewidth and polarization dependence characteristic of a dipole emitter. The emitter exhibits high brightness and temporal stability, and second-order photon correlation measurements confirm its single-photon nature. Furthermore, we successfully achieve on-chip excitation via the SiN waveguide, demonstrating the compatibility of our approach with mature photonic platform technologies. This deterministic integration technique offers a scalable pathway for incorporating quantum emitters into photonic circuits, paving the way for the development of quantum information processing and communication systems with two-dimensional material hybrid photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling in Helical Waveguides: A Local Duality Perspective and Emergent Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual symmetry is an intrinsic property of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to a global U(1) symmetry in vacuum, with helicity as the associated conserved quantity. In this paper, we investigate light propagation in a spin-degenerate medium using a field-theoretical approach and introduce an effective gauge field A_s that emerges from the localization of dual symmetry. Within the geometric optics approximation, we show that the helical trajectory of light rays reveals this gauge field as a manifestation of spin-orbit coupling. Although orbital-orbit coupling also arises in such systems, the spin-orbit interaction possesses deeper physical significance, as it originates from the intrinsic dual symmetry embedded in Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Lifecycle Management of Optical Networks with Dynamic-Updating Digital Twin: A Hybrid Data-Driven and Physics-Informed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) techniques have been proposed for the autonomous operation and lifecycle management of next-generation optical networks. To fully utilize potential capacity and accommodate dynamic services, the DT must dynamically update in sync with deployed optical networks throughout their lifecycle, ensuring low-margin operation. This paper proposes a dynamic-updating DT for the lifecycle management of optical networks, employing a hybrid approach that integrates data-driven and physics-informed techniques for fiber channel modeling. This integration ensures both rapid calculation speed and high physics consistency in optical performance prediction while enabling the dynamic updating of critical physical parameters for DT. The lifecycle management of optical networks, covering accurate performance prediction at the network deployment and dynamic updating during network operation, is demonstrated through simulation in a large-scale network. Up to 100 times speedup in prediction is observed compared to classical numerical methods. In addition, the fiber Raman gain strength, amplifier frequency-dependent gain profile, and connector loss between fiber and amplifier on C and L bands can be simultaneously updated. Moreover, the dynamic-updating DT is verified on a field-trial C+L-band transmission link, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 1.4 dB for performance estimation post-device replacement. Overall, the dynamic-updating DT holds promise for driving the next-generation optical networks towards lifecycle autonomous management.</description>

      <title>Existence of Friedrich-Wintgen bound states in the continuum: system of Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is an eigenmode with the corresponding eigenvalue embedded in the continuous spectrum. There is currently a significant research interest on BICs in the photonics community, because they can be used to induce strong resonances that are useful for lasing, sensing, harmonic generation, etc. The existence of BICs in classical or quantum wave systems has only been established for some relatively simple cases such as BICs protected by symmetry. In 1985, Friedrich and Wintgen (Physical Review A, Vol. 32, pp. 3232-3242, 1985) suggested that BICs may appear from the destructive interference of two resonances coupled to a single radiation channel. They used a system of three one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equations to illustrate this process. Many BICs in classical wave systems seem to follow this mechanism and are now called Friedrich-Wintgen BICs. However, Friedrich and Wintgen did not show the existence of BICs in their system of three Schr\"{o}dinger equations. Instead, they approximated the original system by a model with one Schr\"{o}dinger equation and two algebraic equations, and only analyzed BICs in the approximate model. In this paper, we give a rigorous justification for the existence of BICs in the original system of three 1D Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Doubly Resonant Cavities for ReLU Function in Nanophotonic Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to implementing all-optical Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions using compact doubly-resonant cavities with dimensions of approximately $10\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our design leverages $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear processes within carefully engineered photonic structures that simultaneously resonate at both fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies. By exploiting the phase-sensitive nature of second-harmonic generation, we demonstrate an optical analog to the ReLU function, achieving femtojoule-level activation energy-comparable to state-of-the-art approaches-while reducing device footprint by two orders of magnitude compared to previous implementations. We develop the theoretical framework using coupled-mode theory and validate it through rigorous finite-difference time-domain simulations. Beyond ReLU, we show that the same physical structure can implement alternative activation functions such as ELU and GELU through simple adjustments to input conditions. Neural network simulations demonstrate that our proposed optical activation functions achieve classification accuracy within $0.4\%$ of ideal electronic implementations while offering significant advantages in energy efficiency and processing speed. This work represents a significant advancement toward realizing energy-efficient, high-density optical neural networks for next-generation artificial intelligence hardware.</description>

      <title>Studying thermal radiation with T-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a basic formalism for computing thermal radiation by combining Waterman's T-matrix method with an algebraic approach to light-matter interactions. The formalism applies to nano-particles, clusters thereof, and also molecules. In exemplary applications, we explore how a chiral structure can induce an imbalance in the circular polarization of thermal radiation. While the imbalance is rather small for a chiral molecule such as R-BINOL, a much larger imbalance is observed for an optimized silver helix of approximately 200 nm in size. Besides the directional Kirchhoff law used in this article, the formalism is suitable for implementing more nuanced theories, and it provides a straightforward path to the computation of thermal radiation spectra of astronomical objects moving at relativistic speeds with respect to the measurement devices.</description>

      <title>Fiber laser based stimulated Raman photothermal microscopy with long working distance optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a highly sensitive chemical imaging technique. However, the broader application of SRS has been limited by two key challenges: the reliance on low-noise but bulky solid-state laser sources and stringent sample requirements necessitated by high numerical aperture (NA) optics. Here, we present a fiber laser based stimulated Raman photothermal (SRP) microscope that addresses these limitations. While appreciating the portability and compactness of a noisy source, fiber laser SRP enables a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in signal to noise ratio over fiber laser SRS without balance detection. Furthermore, with the use of low NA, long working distance optics for signal collection, SRP expands the allowed sample space from millimeters to centimeters, which diversifies the sample formats to multi-well plates and thick tissues. The sensitivity and imaging depth are further amplified by using urea for both thermal enhancement and tissue clearance. Together, fiber laser SRP microscopy provides a robust, user-friendly platform for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Parallel Single-Pixel Imaging for 3D Reconstruction: New Insights and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of intelligent manufacturing and autonomous vehicles has intensified the demand for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction under complex reflection and transmission conditions. Traditional structured light techniques rely on inherent point-to-point triangulation, which limits accurate 3D measurements in these challenging scenarios. Parallel single-pixel imaging (PSI) has demonstrated unprecedented superiority under extreme conditions and has emerged as a promising approach of accurate 3D measurements. However, a complete theoretical model has not been reported in existing work to well explain its underlying mechanisms and quantitatively characterize its performance. In this study, a comprehensive theoretical model for the PSI method is proposed, including imaging and noise models. The proposed imaging model describes light transport coefficients under complex illumination, elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of successful 3D imaging using PSI. The developed noise model quantitatively analyzes the impact of environmental noise on measurement accuracy, offering a framework to guide the error analysis of a PSI system. Numerical simulations and experimental results validate the proposed models, revealing the generality and robustness of PSI. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to guide and inspire future investigations. The established theoretical models lay a solid foundation of PSI and brings new insights and opportunities for future application in more demanding 3D reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Automated Routing-Informed Placement for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As technology advances, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are rapidly scaling in size and complexity, with modern designs integrating thousands of components. However, the analog custom layout nature of photonics, the curvy waveguide structures, and single-layer routing resources impose stringent physical constraints, such as minimum bend radii and waveguide crossing penalties, which make manual layout the de facto standard. This manual process takes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable for large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted force-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with limited routability and scalability. To fill this fundamental gap in the electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain, we present the first GPU-accelerated, routing-informed placement framework. It features an asymmetric bending-aware wirelength function with explicit modeling of waveguide routing congestion and crossings for routability maximization. Meanwhile, conditional projection is employed to gradually enforce a variety of user-defined layout constraints, including alignment, spacing, etc. This constrained optimization is accelerated and stabilized by a custom blockwise adaptive Nesterov-accelerated optimizer, ensuring stable and high-quality convergence. Compared to existing methods, our method can generate high-quality layouts for large-scale PICs with an average routing success rate of 94.79% across all benchmarks within minutes. By tightly coupling placement with physical-aware routing, our method establishes a new paradigm for automated PIC design, bringing intelligent, scalable layout synthesis to the forefront of next-generation EPDA. We will open-source our code.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Infrared Transmission Contrast Upon Phase Transition of Thermally Grown Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films by Rapid Thermal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) material, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing with forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5 formed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic film and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically studied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical resistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing surface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase transition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully oxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from thermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase transition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4{\deg}C in both infrared transmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of best quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The thermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication of high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for high-performance thermal control applications.</description>

      <title>Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a plain gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</description>

Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in diamond is a promising system for quantum technologies due to its exceptional optical and spin properties. This has led to great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group IV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV vacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute the onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes. Based on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic generation (SHG) are highly sought in today's technology. However, discovering novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles calculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties. Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD) database and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the discovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.</description>

Abstract: Chirality in integrated quantum photonics has emerged as a promising route towards achieving scalable quantum technologies with quantum nonlinearity effects. Topological photonic waveguides, which utilize helical optical modes, have been proposed as a novel approach to harnessing chiral light-matter interactions on-chip. However, uncertainties remain regarding the nature and strength of the chiral coupling to embedded quantum emitters, hindering the scalability of these systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of chiral coupling in topological photonic waveguides using a combination of experimental, theoretical, and numerical analyses. We quantitatively characterize the position-dependence nature of the light-matter coupling on several topological photonic waveguides and benchmark their chiral coupling performance against conventional line defect waveguides for chiral quantum optical applications. Our results provide crucial insights into the degree and characteristics of chiral light-matter interactions in topological photonic quantum circuits and pave the way towards the implementation of quantitatively-predicted quantum nonlinear effects on-chip.</description>

Abstract: The angular momentum of light can be elegantly mapped onto high-order Poincare spheres, providing a powerful framework for describing structured light beams. Such beams have shown extraordinary potential across diverse applications, including high-capacity optical communications, precision metrology, and quantum information processing. While various methods exist for generating structured light beams, the dynamic synthesis and flexible control of arbitrary vectorial states on diverse, multidimensional Poincare spheres still rely on bulky free-space optical components, posing significant challenges for scalability and integration. To date, a fully tunable solution implemented on a single photonic chip has yet to be realized. Here, we present the first fully tunable on-chip meta-generator capable of dynamically mapping arbitrary scalar, vectorial, and hybrid modes onto the full hierarchy of Poincare spheres, and even extending to a high-dimensional Poincare hypersphere within a four-dimensional Hilbert space. Our device is implemented on an eight-channel space-multiplexed multimode silicon photonic integrated circuit, where densely integrated mode multiplexers, amplitude-phase modulators, and an inverse-designed multimode meta-waveguide together enable compact, precise, and programmable control of structured light. The multimode meta-waveguide directly maps eight on-chip guided modes to orbital angular momentum (OAM), supporting broadband generation of high-purity OAM modes with diverse polarization states and topological charges. By simultaneously engineering amplitude, phase, polarization, and topological charge, we achieve full-field control over OAM mode bases, enabling fully tunable access to arbitrary scalar and vectorial states across more than eight distinct Poincare spheres.</description>

Abstract: The compositional asymmetry of Janus micro- and nanoparticles gives unprecedented opportunities to manipulate such composite particles with different stimuli to achieve enhanced optical, magnetic and photothermal responses, which can be exploited for sensing, phototherapy, and nanoscale robotic applications. This perspective overviews recent advances in optical manipulation of plasmonic Janus particles and their implications for biomedical applications. In particular, a brief summary of optical, plasmonic, and magnetic manipulation of Janus particles of various compositions are presented. Moreover, the potentials of plasmonic and magnetic Janus particles for targeted drug delivery, photothermal therapy, hyperthermia, bio-imaging, bio-detection, and neuromodulation are briefly discussed. Finally, a perspective on the rational design and applications of this particular family of asymmetric particles is forwarded.</description>

      <title>Bisingular surface polaritons at the interface of two uniaxial media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some anisotropic bulk media (for example, biaxial weakly absorbing crystals) there are special directions along which the plane wave field distribution has a singular profile of the form $\propto (\mathbf{n} \mathbf{r}) \exp(i q \mathbf{n} \mathbf{r})$. They are also known as Voigt waves. Similar singular profiles also arise in the theory of surface electromagnetic waves in anisotropic media. In this work we have considered surface polaritons at the interface of two, generally different, uniaxial media. Optic axis of both media is parallel to the interface. One of the specific solutions, called bisingular, greatly simplifies the dispersion equation for surface polaritons. In this case the analytical solution in closed form is found and existence conditions have been determined. It is shown that bisingular surface polariton exists only for certain angles between the optic axes, which are found from two cubic equations. All parameters of the bisingular surface polariton depend only on permittivities and this angle. If one medium is weakly anisotropic, or both media are almost the same then two angles exist. In the general case of two arbitrary media there can be from two to six such angles.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Maximum Chirality in Dielectric Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum structural chirality refers to the highest selectivity for circularly polarized light (CPL) in nanostructures, often manifested as maximum circular dichroism (CD), optical rotation (OR), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future investigations of chiral nanostructures.</description>

Abstract: Scattering and absorption are fundamental processes in optical engineering and applications. This study investigates the use of the food dye tartrazine to design refractive index fluids that enhance light propagation through scattering media.

      <description>arXiv:2504.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the computation of the scattering of light by a nonlinear slab under conical incidence and arbitrary polarization. We consider an anisotropic slab, fully described by its susceptibility tensors; as a result, the full vector problem must be considered. The two-dimensional problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem using symmetry arguments, which is then solved by an iterative process using the finite element method. Energetic considerations are also addressed. Several numerical experiments involving a KTP slab are presented, including the incident TE and TM cases.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mode Enhancement in Coherent-harmonic Dual-comb Spectroscopy Enables Exceeding 300-fold Averaging Time Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) is a novel Fourier-transform spectroscopy not relying on mechanical scanning and capable of simultaneously achieving high speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth. Nevertheless, it suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single acquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by the high-peak-power mode-locked pulses, making coherent averaging an essential means to improve SNR, at the price of compromising the exceptional time resolution and placing more stringent demands on mutual coherence and stability. In this study, a novel approach to enhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in coherent-harmonic pulses is demonstrated. As a proof-of-concept, two frequency combs with mode spacing of $\sim$12.5 MHz, operated at a 20th harmonic repetition rate of $\sim$250 MHz, are employed, demonstrating a $&gt;$300-fold reduction in averaging time for comparable SNR in conventional DCS. This reduction is expected to be further enhanced through integration with ultra-high repetition rate combs like microresonator combs. This new approach promises both a recovery of the inherent high-speed capability and a mitigation of the coherence-time requirements, thereby making it possible to significantly facilitate subsequent DCS investigations and field deployments.</description>

      <title>Laser power stabilization using conservation law in acoustic optic modulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser power stabilization plays an important role in modern precision instruments based on atom-laser interactions. Here we demonstrate an alternative active control method of laser power utilizing the conservation law in an acoustic optic modulator (AOM). By adjusting the 1st order beam power to dynamically follow the fluctuation of the total power of all diffraction beams, the 0th order application beam as the difference term, is stabilized. Experimental result demonstrates that the relative power noise of the controlled application beam is reduced by a factor of 200, reaching $4 \times 10^{-6} $ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 10$^{-4}$ Hz compared with the uncontrolled total power. Allan deviation shows that the application beam reaches a relative power instability of 3.28$\times 10^{-6}$ at 500 s averaging time. In addition, the method allows a high availability of total power source. The method opens a new way of laser power stabilization and shall be very useful in applications such as atomic clocks, laser interferometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Tailoring hBN's Phonon Polaritons with the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate terahertz chiral sub-wavelength cavities that break time-reversal symmetry by coupling the degenerate linearly polarized modes of two orthogonal sets of nano-antenna arrays using the inter-Landau level transition of a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, realizing normalized light-matter coupling rates up to $\Omega_R/\omega_{\mathrm{cav}} = 0.78$ with a dispersion that is modified by the parasitic capacitive coupling between the orthogonal antennas. The deep sub-wavelength confinement of the nano-antennas means that the ultra-strong coupling regime can be reached even with a small number of carriers compared to Fabry-Perot cavities, making it viable to be used with a variety of 2D materials. The non-degenerate circularly polarized ground state was only obtained after carefully optimizing the optical design to minimize the parasitic coupling to linearly polarized light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip emitters that can generate single and entangled photons are essential building blocks for developing photonic quantum information processing technologies in a scalable fashion. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light on demand, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and low quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</description>

Abstract: Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit fidelity of operation. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz$^{2}$/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</description>

      <title>First x-rays from a compact and tunable LINAC-based Compton scattering source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first measurements of x-rays produced with a compact, narrowband, and tunable inverse Compton scattering-based x-ray source, developed at Eindhoven University of Technology. A flux of $1.2 \cdot 10^3$ photons per shot was measured, in agreement with simulations. Using a high-resolution spectral camera, we show that the photon energy can be tuned continuously from 5.8~keV to 10.7~keV with a bandwidth of 4\%. The measured x-ray pulse length was in the picosecond range. Additionally, we show that the source allows full control over the x-ray polarization control. By optimizing experimental parameters, implementing improvements to the setup and further conditioning of the accelerator structure, a brilliance of $10^{12}$ photons/(s $\times$ mrad$^2$ $\times$ mm${^{2}}$ $\times$ 0.1\% BW) can be achieved, with photon energies up to 40 keV. Because the complete electron beamline fits on a single optical table, it is suitable as an in-house x-ray source for university laboratories, industrial production lines, museums, and hospitals.</description>
