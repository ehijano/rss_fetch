      <title>Implicit Collision Multiplicity Adjustment for Efficient Monte Carlo Transport Simulation of Reactivity Excursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implicit collision method with on-the-fly multiplicity adjustment based on the forward weight window methodology for efficient Dynamic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of reactivity excursion transport problems. Test problems based on the Dragon experiment of 1945 by Otto Frisch are devised to verify and assess the efficiency of the method. The test problems exhibit the key features of the Dragon experiment, namely nine orders of magnitude neutron flux bursts followed by significant post-burst delayed neutron effects. Such an extreme reactivity excursion is particularly challenging and has never been solved with Dynamic MC. The proposed implicit collision multiplicity adjustment, in conjunction with a simple forced delayed neutron precursor decay technique, profitably trades simulation precision for reduced runtime, leading to an improved figure of merit, enabling efficient Dynamic MC simulation of extreme reactivity excursions.</description>

      <title>Derivative Source Method for Monte Carlo Transport Calculation of Sensitivities to Material Densities and Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Derivative Source Method (DSM) takes derivatives of a particle transport equation with respect to selected parameters and solves them via the standard Monte Carlo random walk simulation along with the original transport problem. The Monte Carlo solutions of the derivative equations make the sensitivities of quantities of interest to the selected parameters. In this paper, we show that DSM can be embedded in Monte Carlo simulation to simultaneously calculate sensitivities of transport phase-space solution to multiple object dimensions and material densities. We verify and assess the efficiency of DSM by solving a multigroup neutronic system of a source-driven fuel-moderator-absorber slab lattice and calculating the fast and slow flux sensitivity coefficient distributions to the fuel and absorber dimensions, as well as the fuel, moderator, and absorber densities. The results are compared to those obtained from conventional finite difference sensitivity calculations. A figure of merit, defined as the product inverse of runtime and square of relative error, is used to assess method efficiencies. For a couple of the calculated sensitivities, well-configured finite difference calculations are the most efficient, followed closely by DSM. However, since seeking such well-configured finite difference is not always practical, in the rest of the cases, including the all-parameter simultaneous sensitivity calculation, DSM has the highest efficiency, demonstrating its robustness.</description>

      <title>Efficient stochastic simulation of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes and its application to the Morris-Lecar model of neural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise-deterministic Markov processes combine continuous in time dynamics with jump events, the rates of which generally depend on the continuous variables and thus are not constants. This leads to a problem in a Monte-Carlo simulation of such a system, where, at each step, one must find the time instant of the next event. The latter is determined by an integral equation and usually is rather slow in numerical implementation. We suggest a reformulation of the next event problem as an ordinary differential equation where the independent variable is not the time but the cumulative rate. This reformulation is similar to the H\'enon approach to efficiently constructing the Poincar\'e map in deterministic dynamics. The problem is then reduced to a standard numerical task of solving a system of ordinary differential equations with given initial conditions on a prescribed interval. We illustrate the method with a stochastic Morris-Lecar model of neuron spiking with stochasticity in the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels.</description>

      <title>Repulsive interatomic potentials calculated at three levels of theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-energy repulsive interaction between nuclei at distances much smaller than the equilibrium bond length is the key quantity determining the nuclear stopping power and atom scattering in keV and MeV radiation events. This interaction is traditionally modeled within orbital-free density functional theory with frozen atomic electron densities, following the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) model. In this work, we calculate atom pair specific repulsive interatomic potentials with the ZBL model, and compare them to two kinds of quantum chemical calculations - second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory in flexible Gaussian basis sets as well as density functional theory with numerical atomic orbital basis sets - which go well beyond the limitations in the ZBL model, allowing the density to relax in the calculations. We show that the repulsive interatomic potentials predicted by the two quantum chemical models agree within $\sim$ 1% for potential energies above 30 eV, while the ZBL pair-specific potentials and universal ZBL potentials differ much more from either of these calculations. We provide new pair-specific fits of the screening functions in terms of 3 exponentials to the calculations for all pairs $Z_1$-$Z_2$ for $1 \leq Z_i \leq 92$, and show that they agree within $\sim 2$% with the raw data. We use the new potentials to simulate ion implantation depth profiles in single crystalline Si and show very good agreement with experiment. However, we also show that under channeling conditions, the attractive part of the potential can affect the depth profiles. The full data sets of all the calculated interatomic potentials as well as analytic fits to the data are shared as open access.</description>

      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>

      <title>OpenFOAMGPT: a RAG-Augmented LLM Agent for OpenFOAM-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a large language model (LLM)-based agent OpenFOAMGPT tailored for OpenFOAM-centric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, leveraging two foundation models from OpenAI: the GPT-4o and a chain-of-thought (CoT)-enabled o1 preview model. Both agents demonstrate success across multiple tasks. While the price of token with o1 model is six times as that of GPT-4o, it consistently exhibits superior performance in handling complex tasks, from zero-shot case setup to boundary condition modifications, turbulence model adjustments, and code translation. Through an iterative correction loop, the agent efficiently addressed single- and multi-phase flow, heat transfer, RANS, LES, and other engineering scenarios, often converging in a limited number of iterations at low token costs. To embed domain-specific knowledge, we employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, demonstrating how preexisting simulation setups can further specialize the agent for sub-domains such as energy and aerospace. Despite the great performance of the agent, human oversight remains crucial for ensuring accuracy and adapting to shifting contexts. Fluctuations in model performance over time suggest the need for monitoring in mission-critical applications. Although our demonstrations focus on OpenFOAM, the adaptable nature of this framework opens the door to developing LLM-driven agents into a wide range of solvers and codes. By streamlining CFD simulations, this approach has the potential to accelerate both fundamental research and industrial engineering advancements.</description>

      <title>Open-source Flux Transport (OFT). I. HipFT -- High-performance Flux Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (github.com/predsci/hipft). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Preserving Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Spectral Two-Moment Radiation Transport in Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a realizability-preserving numerical method for solving a spectral two-moment model to simulate the transport of massless, neutral particles interacting with a steady background material moving with relativistic velocities. The model is obtained as the special relativistic limit of a four-momentum-conservative general relativistic two-moment model. Using a maximum-entropy closure, we solve for the Eulerian-frame energy and momentum. The proposed numerical method is designed to preserve moment realizability, which corresponds to moments defined by a nonnegative phase-space density. The realizability-preserving method is achieved with the following key components: (i) a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) phase-space discretization with specially constructed numerical fluxes in the spatial and energy dimensions; (ii) a strong stability-preserving implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-integration method; (iii) a realizability-preserving conserved to primitive moment solver; (iv) a realizability-preserving implicit collision solver; and (v) a realizability-enforcing limiter. Component (iii) is necessitated by the closure procedure, which closes higher order moments nonlinearly in terms of primitive moments. The nonlinear conserved to primitive and the implicit collision solves are formulated as fixed-point problems, which are solved with custom iterative solvers designed to preserve the realizability of each iterate. With a series of numerical tests, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this DG-IMEX method.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fluctuations Inhibit Intermittency in Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard picture of fully-developed turbulence, highly intermittent hydrodynamic fields are nonlinearly coupled across scales, where local energy cascades from large scales into dissipative vortices and large density gradients. Microscopically, however, constituent fluid molecules are in constant thermal (Brownian) motion, but the role of molecular fluctuations on large-scale turbulence is largely unknown, and with rare exceptions, it has historically been considered irrelevant at scales larger than the molecular mean free path. Recent theoretical and computational investigations have shown that molecular fluctuations can impact energy cascade at Kolmogorov length scales. Here we show that molecular fluctuations not only modify energy spectrum at wavelengths larger than the Kolmogorov length in compressible turbulence, but they also significantly inhibit spatio-temporal intermittency across the entire dissipation range. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations of computational fluctuating hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the extreme intermittency characteristic of turbulence models is replaced by nearly-Gaussian statistics in the dissipation range. These results demonstrate that the compressible Navier-Stokes equations should be augmented with molecular fluctuations to accurately predict turbulence statistics across the dissipation range. Our findings have significant consequences for turbulence modeling in applications such as astrophysics, reactive flows, and hypersonic aerodynamics, where dissipation-range turbulence is approximated by closure models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ultrafast Thermalization of Photoexcited Carriers in Two-Dimensional Materials Induced by Orbital Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of photoexcited carriers is essential for advancing photoelectronic device design. Photon absorption generates electron-hole pairs, and subsequent scatterings can induce ultrafast thermalization within a picosecond, forming a quasi-equilibrium distribution with overheated electrons. The high-energy tail of this distribution enables carriers to overcome energy barriers, thereby enhancing quantum efficiency--a phenomenon known as photo-thermionic emission (PTE). Despite its importance, the onset and mechanisms of PTE remain under debate. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we investigate ultrafast carrier thermalization in two-dimensional materials graphene and PtTe2, and the results reveal distinct differences. In graphene, both electrons and holes thermalize into Fermi-Dirac distributions with good agreement to experiment, while PtTe2 exhibits anomalous high-energy tails for both electrons and holes, deviating significantly from Fermi-Dirac behavior. We attribute this anomaly to differences in orbital coupling between the two materials, from which we derive design principles for identifying optimal PTE candidates and, ultimately, improving photodetector performance.</description>

      <title>Coupled-cluster pairing models for radicals with strong correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pairing hierarchy of perfect pairing (PP), perfect quadruples (PQ) and perfect hextuples (PH) are sparsified coupled cluster models that are exact in a pairing active space for 2, 4, and 6 electron clusters, respectively. We describe and implement three extensions for radicals. First is the trivial generalization that does not correlate radical orbitals. The second model (PQr, PHr) includes terms that entangle pair indices and radical indices such that their maximum total number is 2 for PQ and 3 for PH (like their closed-shell versions). The third family of extended radical models (PPxr, PQxr, and PHxr) include cluster amplitudes that entangle up to 1, 2, and 3 pair indices with up to 1, 2, and 3 radical indices. Notably, PPxr and PQxr are exact for (3e,3o) and (5e,5o), respectively, while still having only $O(N)$ and $O(N^{2}$) amplitudes like their parent models (for $N$ paired electrons). Orbital optimization is considered for PPxr. A series of large-scale numerical tests of these models are presented for spin gaps, and ionization energies of polyenes and polyenyl radicals, ranging in size from ethene and allyl radical up to C$_{22}$H$_{24}$ in full-valence active spaces up to (122e,122o). The xR models perform best.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma, which constitutes 99\% of the visible matter in the universe, is characterized by a wide range of waves and instabilities that play a pivotal role in space physics, astrophysics, laser-plasma interactions, fusion research, and laboratory experiments. The linear physics of these phenomena is described by kinetic dispersion relations (KDR). However, solving KDRs for arbitrary velocity distributions remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-Maxwellian distributions frequently observed in various plasma environments. This work introduces a novel, efficient, and unified numerical framework to address this challenge. The proposed method rapidly and accurately yields all significant solutions of KDRs for nearly arbitrary velocity distributions, supporting both unstable and damped modes across all frequencies and wavevectors. The approach expands plasma species' velocity distribution functions using a series of carefully chosen orthogonal basis functions and employs a highly accurate rational approximation to transform the problem into an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem, eliminating the need for initial guesses. The efficiency and versatility of this framework are demonstrated, enabling simplified studies of plasma waves with arbitrary distributions. This advancement paves the way for uncovering new physics in natural plasma environments, such as spacecraft observations in space plasmas, and applications like wave heating in fusion research.</description>

Abstract: The achievement of selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond is challenging due to the emergence of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or clathrates possessing similar free energy. Although both polymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it at lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a promising candidate for photonic applications.Herein, we demonstrate that the 1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic diamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are manifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We provide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement, resembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the similarities to the antiferromagnetic systems. We always observe the mixture of both hexagonal and cubic diamonds, however, the formation of such stacking hybrids is observed for a wider range of patch sizes compared to the one-component system.</description>

Abstract: BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD "Rome" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Pitching NACA 0018 Airfoil in Low Reynolds Number Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of the symmetric NACA 0018 airfoil under harmonic pitching motions at low Reynolds numbers, a regime characterized by the presence of laminar separation bubbles and their impact on aerodynamic forces. The analysis encompasses oscillation frequencies of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 13.3 Hz, with amplitudes of 4{\deg} and 8{\deg}, along with steady-state simulations conducted for angles of attack up to 20{\deg} to validate the numerical model. The results reveal that the Transition SST turbulence model provides improved predictions of aerodynamic forces at higher Reynolds numbers but struggles at lower Reynolds numbers, where laminar flow effects dominate. The inclusion of the 13.3 Hz frequency, relevant to Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines, demonstrates the model's effectiveness in capturing dynamic hysteresis loops and reduced oscillations, contrasting with the \(k-\omega\) SST model. Comparisons with XFOIL further highlight challenges in accurately modeling laminar-to-turbulent transitions and dynamic flow phenomena. These findings offer valuable insights into the aerodynamic behavior of thick airfoils under low Reynolds number conditions and contribute to advancing the understanding of turbulence modeling, particularly in applications involving vertical-axis wind turbines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of ultrafast phenomena is a frontier of condensed matter research, where the interplay of theory, computation, and experiment is unveiling new opportunities for understanding and engineering quantum materials. With the advent of advanced experimental techniques and computational tools, it has become possible to probe and manipulate nonequilibrium processes at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions, providing insights into the dynamical behavior of matter under extreme conditions. These capabilities have the potential to revolutionize fields ranging from optoelectronics and quantum information to catalysis and energy storage.
  This Roadmap captures the collective progress and vision of leading researchers, addressing challenges and opportunities across key areas of ultrafast science. Contributions in this Roadmap span the development of ab initio methods for time-resolved spectroscopy, the dynamics of driven correlated systems, the engineering of materials in optical cavities, and the adoption of FAIR principles for data sharing and analysis. Together, these efforts highlight the interdisciplinary nature of ultrafast research and its reliance on cutting-edge methodologies, including quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory, correlated electronic structure methods, nonequilibrium Green's function approaches, quantum and ab initio simulations.</description>

      <title>Neural equilibria for long-term prediction of nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Discrete Equilibrium (NeurDE), a machine learning (ML) approach for long-term forecasting of flow phenomena that relies on a "lifting" of physical conservation laws into the framework of kinetic theory. The kinetic formulation provides an excellent structure for ML algorithms by separating nonlinear, non-local physics into a nonlinear but local relaxation to equilibrium and a linear non-local transport. This separation allows the ML to focus on the local nonlinear components while addressing the simpler linear transport with efficient classical numerical algorithms. To accomplish this, we design an operator network that maps macroscopic observables to equilibrium states in a manner that maximizes entropy, yielding expressive BGK-type collisions. By incorporating our surrogate equilibrium into the lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm, we achieve accurate flow forecasts for a wide range of challenging flows. We show that NeurDE enables accurate prediction of compressible flows, including supersonic flows, while tracking shocks over hundreds of time steps, using a small velocity lattice-a heretofore unattainable feat without expensive numerical root finding.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Continuous Transition in a Fast Rotating Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the saturation of three-dimensional unstable perturbations on a fast rotating turbulent flow using direct numerical simulations (DNSs). Under the effect of Kolmogorov forcing, a transition between states dominated by coherent two-dimensional modes to states with three-dimensional variations (quasi-two-dimensional) is observed as we change the global rotation rate. We find this akin to a critical phenomenon, wherein the order parameter scales with the distance to the critical point raised to an exponent. The exponent itself deviates from the predicted mean field value. Also, the nature of the fluctuations of the order parameter near the critical point indicate the presence of on-off intermittency. The critical rotation rate at which the transition occurs exhibits a linear scaling behaviour with the forcing wave number. A reduced model based on linear stability analysis is used to find the linear threshold estimates; we find these to be in good agreement with the 3D nonlinear DNS results.</description>

      <title>Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models and the principle of maximum entropy. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($&lt;0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation, and thus a significantly longer forecast time than the traditional method.</description>

      <title>Competing Effects of Local Solvation Structures on Chemical Shift Changes of Liquid Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Capillary Pressure-Saturation relation derived from the Pore Morphology Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method to calculate the capillary pressure-saturation relations of immiscible multiphase flow on two-dimensional pore morphologies is presented here. The method is an extension of the Pore Morphology Method that includes wetting angle and trapped mechanism of the displaced fluid, and calculation of material properties by density functional theory. After validating the method with micro-chip fluid injection experiments, the method is used to relate pore morphology to capillary pressure-saturation relation using square-lattice pore morphologies. Because the method uses only morphological binary operations, it is more efficient than well-established high-resolution voxel dynamics methods such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods and Level-set computational fluid dynamics. Apart from pore morphology, only the material parameters related to contact angle (wettability) and interfacial tension are required to connect the pore-saturation relation and pore throat distribution. We investigate the effect on interfacial tension, wettability, sample size, and pore throat distribution on entry pressure and residual saturation.</description>

      <title>Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room-temperature metals and semi-metals which consist of a gas of bound electrons in a near-continuum band structure can be classified as cold quantum plasmas. This insight suggests that Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, traditionally used for modeling classical plasmas, may be adapted for the next generation of nanoscopic simulations in photonics, plasmonics, and beyond. This article introduces four key physics modules implemented in two open-source PIC codes that can be applied to condensed matter calculations. These modules include (I) the incorporation of Fermi-Dirac (FD) electrons, (II) material structure boundary conditions, (III) a bound particle model for linear dispersive materials, and (IV) the inclusion of massless Dirac carriers for simulating graphene-like materials. By integrating these modules into existing PIC frameworks, we provide a versatile and self-consistent approach for simulating condensed matter systems, opening new avenues for modeling dynamic phenomena in photonics and plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Wavelet Method for the Solution of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a high-order spacetime wavelet method for the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations with a user-prescribed accuracy. The technique utilizes wavelet theory with a priori error estimates to discretize the problem in both the spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. We also propose a novel wavelet-based recursive algorithm to reduce the system sensitivity stemming from steep initial and/or boundary conditions. The resulting nonlinear equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method. We parallelize the construction of the tangent operator along with the solution of the system of algebraic equations. We perform rigorous verification studies using the nonlinear Burgers' equation. The application of the method is demonstrated solving Sod shock tube problem using the Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical results of the method reveal high-order convergence rates for the function as well as its spatial and temporal derivatives. We solve problems with steep gradients in both the spatial and temporal directions with a priori error estimates.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for charge transport in GNRs through particle Galerkin methods for the semiclassical Boltzmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some issues related to the quantification of uncertainties associated with the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons. The approach is suited to understand the effects of missing information linked to the difficulty of fixing some material parameters, such as the band gap, and the strength of the applied electric field. In particular, we focus on the extension of particle Galerkin methods for kinetic equations in the case of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for charge transport in graphene nanoribbons with uncertainties. To this end, we develop an efficient particle scheme which allows us to parallelize the computation and then, after a suitable generalization of the scheme to the case of random inputs, we present a Galerkin reformulation of the particle dynamics, obtained by means of a generalized Polynomial Chaos approach, which allows the reconstruction of the kinetic distribution. As a consequence, the proposed particle-based scheme preserves the physical properties and the positivity of the distribution function also in the presence of a complex scattering in the transport equation of electrons. The impact of the uncertainty of the band gap and applied field on the electrical current is analysed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Improved Current Density Reconstruction from 2D Vector Magnetic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconstruction of electrical current densities from magnetic field measurements is an important technique with applications in materials science, circuit design, quality control, plasma physics, and biology. Analytic reconstruction methods exist for planar currents, but break down in the presence of high spatial frequency noise or large standoff distance, restricting the types of systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate the use of a deep convolutional neural network for current density reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images of vector magnetic fields acquired by a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) utilizing a surface layer of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Trained network performance significantly exceeds analytic reconstruction for data with high noise or large standoff distances. This machine learning technique can perform quality inversions on lower SNR data, reducing the data collection time by a factor of about 400 and permitting reconstructions of weaker and three-dimensional current sources.</description>

Abstract: The finite element method offers attractive methods for the numerical solution of coupled field problems arising in sensors and actuator simulations of various physical domains, like electrodynamics, mechanics, and thermodynamics. With this application perspective and being open, accessible, and fast implementations are possible, openCFS was launched in 2020. It provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. In particular, the acoustic module is part of active development, including several key methods. These methods include the perfectly-matched layer technique, non-confirming interface formulations, Lagrangian basis function, Legendre basis functions, spectral element formulations, a nodal element type, edge-based element type (aeroacoustic post-processing), absorbing boundary conditions, frequency dependent-material for time-harmonic and time-dependent simulations. Time-dependent simulations, time-harmonic simulations, and eigenvalue simulations are supported. Several variants of acoustic equations are implemented, including the relevant source terms and wave operators for aeroacoustics. The package includes rotating domains and non-conforming interfaces for fan noise simulations. It also contains an API to the Python3 package pyCFS. This paper presents openCFS with a focus on the acoustic module.</description>

      <title>Detecting charge transfer at defects in 2D materials with electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04469v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly image than the atomic structure. The charge density is dominated by the atomic nuclei, with bonding causing only a small perturbation. Thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity than imaging structure and the overall charge density. Here we achieve the sensitivity required to detect charge transfer in both pristine and defected monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} using the high dose efficiency of electron ptychography and its ability to correct for lens aberrations. Excellent agreement is achieved with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography configuration we use also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the annular dark-field signal, which can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to aid their interpretation.</description>

      <title>Macroproperties vs. Microstates in the Classical Simulation of Critical Phenomena in Quench Dynamics of 1D Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPS). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with surprisingly heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, we find that this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results demonstrate that while accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is typically intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating phases of matter of many-body systems (macrostates). We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.</description>

      <title>Design of 2D Skyrmionic Metamaterial Through Controlled Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <title>Are queries and keys always relevant? A case study on Transformer wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dot product attention mechanism, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, is a cornerstone of modern Transformers. It adeptly captures semantic relationships between word pairs in sentences by computing a similarity overlap between queries and keys. In this work, we explore the suitability of Transformers, focusing on their attention mechanisms, in the specific domain of the parametrization of variational wave functions to approximate ground states of quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians. Specifically, we perform numerical simulations on the two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, a common benchmark in the field of quantum many-body systems on lattice. By comparing the performance of standard attention mechanisms with a simplified version that excludes queries and keys, relying solely on positions, we achieve competitive results while reducing computational cost and parameter usage. Furthermore, through the analysis of the attention maps generated by standard attention mechanisms, we show that the attention weights become effectively input-independent at the end of the optimization. We support the numerical results with analytical calculations, providing physical insights of why queries and keys should be, in principle, omitted from the attention mechanism when studying large systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of optical spin polarization of axial divacancy and nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutral divacancy and the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) are two of the most prominent candidates for functioning as room-temperature quantum bits (qubits) with telecommunication-wavelength emission. Nonetheless, the pivotal role of electron-phonon coupling in the spin polarization loop is still unrevealed. In this work, we theoretically investigate the microscopic magneto-optical properties and spin-dependent optical loops utilizing the first-principles calculations. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the electronic level structure, assisted by symmetry analysis. Moreover, the fine interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and spin-spin interaction, are fully characterized to provide versatile qubit functional parameters. Subsequently, we explore the electron-phonon coupling, encompassing dynamics- and pseudo-Jahn--Teller effects in the intersystem crossing transition. In addition, we analyze the photoluminescence PL lifetime based on the major transition rates in the optical spin polarization loop. We compare two promising qubits with similar electronic properties, but their respective rates differ substantially. Finally, we detail the threshold of ODMR contrast for further optimization of the qubit operation. This work not only reveals the mechanism underlying the optical spin polarization but also proposes productive avenues for optimizing quantum information processing tasks based on the ODMR protocol.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation.</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance in the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model under state-dependent time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear one-dimensional FitzHugh--Nagumo neuronal model with an asymmetric potential driven by both a high-frequency and a low-frequency signal. Our numerical analysis focuses on the influence of a state-dependent time delay on vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance phenomena. The response amplitude at the low-frequency is explored to characterize the vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance. By this effort, we realize that for smaller values of the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component, vibrational resonance and multi-resonance occur in the neuronal model. For large values of the high-frequency excitation amplitude, vibrational resonance appears with one peak. We observe a decrease in the response when the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component increases. Also, we analyze how the state-dependent time-delay position and velocity components can give birth to delay-induced resonance for separate and together. The main results of this work are that the state-dependent time-delay velocity component can play a major role in both phenomena. In fact the parameter of the delay can control the triggering of the two resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise spatial manipulation of particles via optical forces is essential in many research areas, ranging from biophysics to atomic physics. Central to this effort is the challenge of designing optical systems that are optimized for specific applications. Traditional design methods often rely on trial-and-error methods, or on models that approximate the particle as a point dipole, which only works for particles much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. In this work, we present a general inverse design framework based on the Maxwell stress tensor formalism capable of simultaneously designing all components of the system, while being applicable to particles of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Notably, we show that with small modifications to the baseline formulation, it is possible to engineer systems capable of attracting, repelling, accelerating, oscillating, and trapping particles. We demonstrate our method using various case studies where we simultaneously design the particle and its environment, with particular focus on free-space particles and particle-metalens systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of 3D Nanophotonic Devices with Structural Integrity Using Auxiliary Thermal Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.</description>
