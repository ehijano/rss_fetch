      <title>Accelerating solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries equation is a fundamental nonlinear equation that describes solitons with constant velocity. On the contrary, here we show that this equation also presents accelerated wavepacket solutions. This behavior is achieved by putting the Korteweg-de Vries equation in terms of the Painlev\'e I equation. The accelerated waveform solutions are explored numerically showing their accelerated behavior explicitly.</description>

      <title>A class of exactly solvable Convection-Diffusion-Reaction equations in similarity form with intrinsic supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we would like to point out the possibility of generating a class of exactly solvable convection-diffusion-reaction equation in similarity form with intrinsic supersymmetry, i.e., the solution and the diffusion coefficient of the equation are supersymmetrically related through their similarity scaling forms.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>

      <title>Miura transformations and large-time behaviors of the Hirota-Satsuma equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The good Boussinesq equation has several modified versions such as the modified Boussinesq equation, Mikhailov-Lenells equation and Hirota-Satsuma equation. This work builds the full relations among these equations by Miura transformation and invertible linear transformations and draws a pyramid diagram to demonstrate such relations. The direct and inverse spectral analysis shows that the solution of Riemann-Hilbert problem for Hirota-Satsuma equation has simple pole at origin, the solution of Riemann-Hilbert problem for the good Boussinesq equation has double pole at origin, while the solution of Riemann-Hilbert problem for the modified Boussinesq equation and Mikhailov-Lenells equation doesn't have singularity at origin. Further, the large-time asymptotic behaviors of the Hirota-Satsuma equation with Schwartz class initial value is studied by Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent analysis. In such initial condition, the asymptotic expressions of the Hirota-Satsuma equation and good Boussinesq equation away from the origin are derived and it is shown that the leading term of asymptotic formulas matches well the direct numerical simulations.</description>
