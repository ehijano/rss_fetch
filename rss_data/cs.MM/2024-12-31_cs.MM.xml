      <title>ChartAdapter: Large Vision-Language Model for Chart Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization. To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>SFE-Net: Harnessing Biological Principles of Differential Gene Expression for Improved Feature Selection in Deep Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of DeepFake detection, the challenge of adapting to various synthesis methodologies such as Faceswap, Deepfakes, Face2Face, and NeuralTextures significantly impacts the performance of traditional machine learning models. These models often suffer from static feature representation, which struggles to perform consistently across diversely generated deepfake datasets. Inspired by the biological concept of differential gene expression, where gene activation is dynamically regulated in response to environmental stimuli, we introduce the Selective Feature Expression Network (SFE-Net). This innovative framework integrates selective feature activation principles into deep learning architectures, allowing the model to dynamically adjust feature priorities in response to varying deepfake generation techniques. SFE-Net employs a novel mechanism that selectively enhances critical features essential for accurately detecting forgeries, while reducing the impact of irrelevant or misleading cues akin to adaptive evolutionary processes in nature. Through rigorous testing on a range of deepfake datasets, SFE-Net not only surpasses existing static models in detecting sophisticated forgeries but also shows enhanced generalization capabilities in cross-dataset scenarios. Our approach significantly mitigates overfitting by maintaining a dynamic balance between feature exploration and exploitation, thus producing more robust and effective deepfake detection models. This bio-inspired strategy paves the way for developing adaptive deep learning systems that are finely tuned to address the nuanced challenges posed by the varied nature of digital forgeries in modern digital forensics.</description>

      <title>EmoReg: Directional Latent Vector Modeling for Emotional Intensity Regularization in Diffusion-based Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) aims to convert the discrete emotional state from the source emotion to the target for a given speech utterance while preserving linguistic content. In this paper, we propose regularizing emotion intensity in the diffusion-based EVC framework to generate precise speech of the target emotion. Traditional approaches control the intensity of an emotional state in the utterance via emotion class probabilities or intensity labels that often lead to inept style manipulations and degradations in quality. On the contrary, we aim to regulate emotion intensity using self-supervised learning-based feature representations and unsupervised directional latent vector modeling (DVM) in the emotional embedding space within a diffusion-based framework. These emotion embeddings can be modified based on the given target emotion intensity and the corresponding direction vector. Furthermore, the updated embeddings can be fused in the reverse diffusion process to generate the speech with the desired emotion and intensity. In summary, this paper aims to achieve high-quality emotional intensity regularization in the diffusion-based EVC framework, which is the first of its kind work. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been shown across state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in terms of subjective and objective evaluations for the English and Hindi languages \footnote{Demo samples are available at the following URL: \url{https://nirmesh-sony.github.io/EmoReg/}}.</description>

      <title>Tri-Ergon: Fine-grained Video-to-Audio Generation with Multi-modal Conditions and LUFS Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation utilizes visual-only video features to produce realistic sounds that correspond to the scene. However, current V2A models often lack fine-grained control over the generated audio, especially in terms of loudness variation and the incorporation of multi-modal conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tri-Ergon, a diffusion-based V2A model that incorporates textual, auditory, and pixel-level visual prompts to enable detailed and semantically rich audio synthesis. Additionally, we introduce Loudness Units relative to Full Scale (LUFS) embedding, which allows for precise manual control of the loudness changes over time for individual audio channels, enabling our model to effectively address the intricate correlation of video and audio in real-world Foley workflows. Tri-Ergon is capable of creating 44.1 kHz high-fidelity stereo audio clips of varying lengths up to 60 seconds, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art V2A methods that typically generate mono audio for a fixed duration.</description>

      <title>Prot\'eg\'e: Learn and Generate Basic Makeup Styles with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Makeup is no longer confined to physical application; people now use mobile apps to digitally apply makeup to their photos, which they then share on social media. However, while this shift has made makeup more accessible, designing diverse makeup styles tailored to individual faces remains a challenge. This challenge currently must still be done manually by humans. Existing systems, such as makeup recommendation engines and makeup transfer techniques, offer limitations in creating innovative makeups for different individuals "intuitively" -- significant user effort and knowledge needed and limited makeup options available in app. Our motivation is to address this challenge by proposing Prot\'eg\'e, a new makeup application, leveraging recent generative model -- GANs to learn and automatically generate makeup styles. This is a task that existing makeup applications (i.e., makeup recommendation systems using expert system and makeup transfer methods) are unable to perform. Extensive experiments has been conducted to demonstrate the capability of Prot\'eg\'e in learning and creating diverse makeups, providing a convenient and intuitive way, marking a significant leap in digital makeup technology!</description>

      <title>ESVQA: Perceptual Quality Assessment of Egocentric Spatial Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of eXtended Reality (XR), egocentric spatial shooting and display technologies have further enhanced immersion and engagement for users. Assessing the quality of experience (QoE) of egocentric spatial videos is crucial to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. However, the corresponding research is still lacking. In this paper, we use the embodied experience to highlight this more immersive experience and study the new problem, i.e., embodied perceptual quality assessment for egocentric spatial videos. Specifically, we introduce the first Egocentric Spatial Video Quality Assessment Database (ESVQAD), which comprises 600 egocentric spatial videos and their mean opinion scores (MOSs). Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-dimensional binocular feature fusion model, termed ESVQAnet, which integrates binocular spatial, motion, and semantic features to predict the perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the ESVQAnet outperforms 16 state-of-the-art VQA models on the embodied perceptual quality assessment task, and exhibits strong generalization capability on traditional VQA tasks. The database and codes will be released upon the publication.</description>

      <title>ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (&lt;1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

      <title>Audiopedia: Audio QA with Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Audiopedia, a novel task called Audio Question Answering with Knowledge, which requires both audio comprehension and external knowledge reasoning. Unlike traditional Audio Question Answering (AQA) benchmarks that focus on simple queries answerable from audio alone, Audiopedia targets knowledge-intensive questions. We define three sub-tasks: (i) Single Audio Question Answering (s-AQA), where questions are answered based on a single audio sample, (ii) Multi-Audio Question Answering (m-AQA), which requires reasoning over multiple audio samples, and (iii) Retrieval-Augmented Audio Question Answering (r-AQA), which involves retrieving relevant audio to answer the question. We benchmark large audio language models (LALMs) on these sub-tasks and observe suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a generic framework that can be adapted to any LALM, equipping them with knowledge reasoning capabilities. Our framework has two components: (i) Audio Entity Linking (AEL) and (ii) Knowledge-Augmented Audio Large Multimodal Model (KA2LM), which together improve performance on knowledge-intensive AQA tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address advanced audio understanding via knowledge-intensive tasks like Audiopedia.</description>

      <title>SM3Det: A Unified Model for Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology, high-resolution multi-modal imagery is now more widely accessible. Conventional Object detection models are trained on a single dataset, often restricted to a specific imaging modality and annotation format. However, such an approach overlooks the valuable shared knowledge across multi-modalities and limits the model's applicability in more versatile scenarios. This paper introduces a new task called Multi-Modal Datasets and Multi-Task Object Detection (M2Det) for remote sensing, designed to accurately detect horizontal or oriented objects from any sensor modality. This task poses challenges due to 1) the trade-offs involved in managing multi-modal modelling and 2) the complexities of multi-task optimization. To address these, we establish a benchmark dataset and propose a unified model, SM3Det (Single Model for Multi-Modal datasets and Multi-Task object Detection). SM3Det leverages a grid-level sparse MoE backbone to enable joint knowledge learning while preserving distinct feature representations for different modalities. Furthermore, it integrates a consistency and synchronization optimization strategy using dynamic learning rate adjustment, allowing it to effectively handle varying levels of learning difficulty across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate SM3Det's effectiveness and generalizability, consistently outperforming specialized models on individual datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SM3Det.</description>

      <title>MarsSQE: Stereo Quality Enhancement for Martian Images Using Bi-level Cross-view Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stereo images captured by Mars rovers are transmitted after lossy compression due to the limited bandwidth between Mars and Earth. Unfortunately, this process results in undesirable compression artifacts. In this paper, we present a novel stereo quality enhancement approach for Martian images, named MarsSQE. First, we establish the first dataset of stereo Martian images. Through extensive analysis of this dataset, we observe that cross-view correlations in Martian images are notably high. Leveraging this insight, we design a bi-level cross-view attention-based quality enhancement network that fully exploits these inherent cross-view correlations. Specifically, our network integrates pixel-level attention for precise matching and patch-level attention for broader contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MarsSQE approach.</description>

      <title>Towards nation-wide analytical healthcare infrastructures: A privacy-preserving augmented knee rehabilitation case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute towards the near-future privacy-preserving big data analytical healthcare platforms, capable of processing streamed or uploaded timeseries data or videos from patients. The experimental work includes a real-life knee rehabilitation video dataset capturing a set of exercises from simple and personalised to more general and challenging movements aimed for returning to sport. To convert video from mobile into privacy-preserving diagnostic timeseries data, we employed Google MediaPipe pose estimation. The developed proof-of-concept algorithms can augment knee exercise videos by overlaying the patient with stick figure elements while updating generated timeseries plot with knee angle estimation streamed as CSV file format. For patients and physiotherapists, video with side-to-side timeseries visually indicating potential issues such as excessive knee flexion or unstable knee movements or stick figure overlay errors is possible by setting a-priori knee-angle parameters. To address adherence to rehabilitation programme and quantify exercise sets and repetitions, our adaptive algorithm can correctly identify (91.67%-100%) of all exercises from side- and front-view videos. Transparent algorithm design for adaptive visual analysis of various knee exercise patterns contributes towards the interpretable AI and will inform near-future privacy-preserving, non-vendor locking, open-source developments for both end-user computing devices and as on-premises non-proprietary cloud platforms that can be deployed within the national healthcare system.</description>

      <title>Towards Identity-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval: a Dataset and a Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced content-based retrieval methods, notably through models like CLIP that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances.

      <title>Visual Style Prompt Learning Using Diffusion Models for Blind Face Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind face restoration aims to recover high-quality facial images from various unidentified sources of degradation, posing significant challenges due to the minimal information retrievable from the degraded images. Prior knowledge-based methods, leveraging geometric priors and facial features, have led to advancements in face restoration but often fall short of capturing fine details. To address this, we introduce a visual style prompt learning framework that utilizes diffusion probabilistic models to explicitly generate visual prompts within the latent space of pre-trained generative models. These prompts are designed to guide the restoration process. To fully utilize the visual prompts and enhance the extraction of informative and rich patterns, we introduce a style-modulated aggregation transformation layer. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving high-quality blind face restoration.

Abstract: Using stickers in online chatting is very prevalent on social media platforms, where the stickers used in the conversation can express someone's intention/emotion/attitude in a vivid, tactful, and intuitive way. Existing sticker retrieval research typically retrieves stickers based on context and the current utterance delivered by the user. That is, the stickers serve as a supplement to the current utterance. However, in the real-world scenario, using stickers to express what we want to say rather than as a supplement to our words only is also important. Therefore, in this paper, we create a new dataset for sticker retrieval in conversation, called \textbf{StickerInt}, where stickers are used to reply to previous conversations or supplement our words\footnote{We believe that the release of this dataset will provide a more complete paradigm than existing work for the research of sticker retrieval in the open-domain online conversation.}. Based on the created dataset, we present a simple yet effective framework for sticker retrieval in conversation based on the learning of intention and the cross-modal relationships between conversation context and stickers, coined as \textbf{Int-RA}. Specifically, we first devise a knowledge-enhanced intention predictor to introduce the intention information into the conversation representations. Subsequently, a relation-aware sticker selector is devised to retrieve the response sticker via cross-modal relationships. Extensive experiments on the created dataset show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in sticker retrieval\footnote{The dataset and source code of this work are released at \url{https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/Int-RA}.}.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with Structured Storyline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.</description>

      <title>Face-StyleSpeech: Enhancing Zero-shot Speech Synthesis from Face Images with Improved Face-to-Speech Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating speech from a face image is crucial for developing virtual humans capable of interacting using their unique voices, without relying on pre-recorded human speech. In this paper, we propose Face-StyleSpeech, a zero-shot Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis model that generates natural speech conditioned on a face image rather than reference speech. We hypothesize that learning entire prosodic features from a face image poses a significant challenge. To address this, our TTS model incorporates both face and prosody encoders. The prosody encoder is specifically designed to model speech style characteristics that are not fully captured by the face image, allowing the face encoder to focus on extracting speaker-specific features such as timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that Face-StyleSpeech effectively generates more natural speech from a face image than baselines, even for unseen faces. Samples are available on our demo page.</description>

      <title>LoVA: Long-form Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation is important for video editing and post-processing, enabling the creation of semantics-aligned audio for silent video. However, most existing methods focus on generating short-form audio for short video segment (less than 10 seconds), while giving little attention to the scenario of long-form video inputs. For current UNet-based diffusion V2A models, an inevitable problem when handling long-form audio generation is the inconsistencies within the final concatenated audio. In this paper, we first highlight the importance of long-form V2A problem. Besides, we propose LoVA, a novel model for Long-form Video-to-Audio generation. Based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, LoVA proves to be more effective at generating long-form audio compared to existing autoregressive models and UNet-based diffusion models. Extensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that LoVA achieves comparable performance on 10-second V2A benchmark and outperforms all other baselines on a benchmark with long-form video input.</description>

      <title>AKiRa: Augmentation Kit on Rays for optical video generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-conditioned video diffusion have greatly improved video quality. However, these methods offer limited or sometimes no control to users on camera aspects, including dynamic camera motion, zoom, distorted lens and focus shifts. These motion and optical aspects are crucial for adding controllability and cinematic elements to generation frameworks, ultimately resulting in visual content that draws focus, enhances mood, and guides emotions according to filmmakers' controls. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between controllable video generation and camera optics. To achieve this, we propose AKiRa (Augmentation Kit on Rays), a novel augmentation framework that builds and trains a camera adapter with a complex camera model over an existing video generation backbone. It enables fine-tuned control over camera motion as well as complex optical parameters (focal length, distortion, aperture) to achieve cinematic effects such as zoom, fisheye effect, and bokeh. Extensive experiments demonstrate AKiRa's effectiveness in combining and composing camera optics while outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. This work sets a new landmark in controlled and optically enhanced video generation, paving the way for future optical video generation methods.</description>

      <title>SoundLoc3D: Invisible 3D Sound Source Localization and Classification Using a Multimodal RGB-D Acoustic Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D sound sources and estimating their semantic labels -- where the sources may not be visible, but are assumed to lie on the physical surface of objects in the scene -- have many real applications, including detecting gas leak and machinery malfunction. The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.</description>

      <title>Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \&amp; evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at https://github.com/LMM101/Awesome-Multimodal-Next-Token-Prediction</description>
