      <title>Two-Dimensional Quaternion Linear Canonical Transform A Novel Framework for Probability Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear canonical transform (LCT) serves as a powerful generalization of the Fourier transform (FT), encapsulating various integral transforms within a unified framework. This versatility has made it a cornerstone in fields such as signal processing, optics, and quantum mechanics. Extending this concept to quaternion algebra, the Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) emerged, enriching the analysis of multidimensional and complex-valued signals. The Quaternion Linear Canonical Transform (QLCT), a further generalization, has now positioned itself as a central tool across various disciplines, including applied mathematics, engineering, computer science, and statistics. In this paper, we introduce the Two Dimensional Quaternion Linear Canonical Transform (2DQLCT) as a novel framework for probability modeling. By leveraging the 2DQLCT, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of probability distributions, particularly in the context of multi-dimensional and complex-valued signals. This framework not only broadens the theoretical underpinnings of probability theory but also opens new avenues for researchers</description>

      <title>Conjugating by singular operators: On the boundedness of similarity transforms near singular points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of, given operators $A$, $Z$ and a sequence of invertible operators $U_n\to Z$, whether the sequence $U_nAU_n^{-1}$ is bounded in norm, as well as generalizations of this where $U_nAU_n^{-1}$ is modified by some bounded linear map on bounded linear operators. In the setting of Hilbert spaces, we provide a complete classification in terms of algebraic criteria of those $A$ for which such a sequence exists, as long as $Z$ is of generalized index zero, which always holds in finite-dimensional contexts. In the process, we prove that particular coefficients arising in inverses of certain good paths going to $Z$ can also be classified in terms of an entirely algebraic criterion.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Strongly Entanglement Breaking channels for infinite-dimensional quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement breaking (EB) channels, as completely positive and trace-preserving linear operators, sever the entanglement between the input system and other systems. In the realm of infinite-dimensional systems, a related concept known as strongly entanglement breaking (SEB) channels emerges. This paper delves into characterizations of SEB channels, delineating necessary and sufficient conditions for a channel to be classified as SEB, especially with respect to the commutativity of its range. Moreover, we demonstrate that every closed self-adjoint subspace of trace-zero operators, with the trace norm, is the null space of a SEB channel.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Operator-Valued Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new kind of measures, called projection families, which generalize the classical notion of vector and operator-valued measures. The maximal class of reasonable functions admits an integral with respect to a projection family, where the integral is defined as an element of the second dual instead of the original space. We show that projection families possess strong enough properties to satisfy the theorems of Monotone Convergence and Dominated convergence, but are much easier to come by than the more restrictive operator-valued measures.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy Class of $C_0$-semigroups on Hilbert Spaces and Their Application to Decay Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate immediately differentiable $C_0$-semigroups $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\sup_{0 &lt; t &lt;1} t^{1/\beta}\|Ae^{-tA}\| &lt; \infty$ for some $0 &lt; \beta \leq 1$. Such $C_0$-semigroups are referred to as the Crandall--Pazy class of $C_0$-semigroups. In the Hilbert space setting, we present two characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy class. We then apply these characterizations to estimate decay rates for Crank--Nicolson schemes with smooth initial data when the associated abstract Cauchy problem is governed by an exponentially stable $C_0$-semigroup in the Crandall--Pazy class. The first approach is based on a functional calculus called the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus. The second approach builds upon estimates derived from Lyapunov equations and improves the decay estimate obtained in the first approach, under the additional assumption that $-A^{-1}$ generates a bounded $C_0$-semigroup.</description>

      <title>Solvability of a System of Nonlinear Integral Equations on the Entire Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of singular integral equations with monotone and concave nonlinearity in the subcritical case is investigated. The specified system and its scalar analog have direct applications in various areas of physics and biology. In particular, scalar and vector equations of this nature are encountered in the dynamic theory of p-adic strings, in the theory of radiative transfer, in the kinetic theory of gases, and in the mathematical theory of the spread of epidemic diseases. A constructive theorem of existence in the space of continuous and bounded vector functions is proved. The integral asymptotic of the constructed solution is studied. An effective iterative process for constructing an approximate solution to this system is proposed. In a certain class of bounded vector functions, the uniqueness of the solution is proved. In the class of bounded vector functions (with non-negative coordinates) with a zero limit at infinity, the absence of an identically zero solution is proved. Examples of the matrix kernel and nonlinearities are given to illustrate the importance of the obtained results. Some of the examples have applications in the above-mentioned branches of natural science.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed empirical wavelet transform was based on a particular type of filter. In this paper, we aim to propose a general framework for the construction of empirical wavelet systems in the continuous case. We define a well-suited formalism and then investigate some general properties of empirical wavelet systems. In particular, we provide some sufficient conditions to the existence of a reconstruction formula. In the second part of the paper, we propose the construction of empirical wavelet systems based on some classic mother wavelets.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Watershed Wavelet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical wavelet transform is an adaptive multiresolution analysis tool based on the idea of building filters on a data-driven partition of the Fourier domain. However, existing 2D extensions are constrained by the shape of the detected partitioning. In this paper, we provide theoretical results that permits us to build 2D empirical wavelet filters based on an arbitrary partitioning of the frequency domain. We also propose an algorithm to detect such partitioning from an image spectrum by combining a scale-space representation to estimate the position of dominant harmonic modes and a watershed transform to find the boundaries of the different supports making the expected partition. This whole process allows us to define the empirical watershed wavelet transform. We illustrate the effectiveness and the advantages of such adaptive transform, first visually on toy images, and next on both unsupervised texture segmentation and image deconvolution applications.</description>

      <title>Fourier coefficients of normalized Cauchy transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a uniqueness problem concerning the Fourier coefficients of normalized Cauchy transforms. These problems inherently involve proving a simultaneous approximation phenomenon and establishing the existence of cyclic inner functions in certain sequence spaces. Our results have several applications in different directions. First, we offer a new non-probabilistic proof of a classic theorem by Kahane and Katzenelson on simultaneous approximation. Secondly, we demonstrate the absence of uniform admissible majorants of Fourier coefficients in de Branges-Rovnyak spaces.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free estimates for low degree functions on the Hamming cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper are dimension-free $L^p$ inequalities, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, for low degree scalar-valued functions on the Hamming cube. More precisely, for any $p&gt;2,$ $\varepsilon&gt;0,$ and $\theta=\theta(\varepsilon,p)\in (0,1)$ satisfying
  \[
  \frac{1}{p}=\frac{\theta}{p+\varepsilon}+\frac{1-\theta}{2}
  \]
  we obtain, for any function $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \mathbb{C}$ whose spectrum is bounded from above by $d,$ the Bernstein-Markov type inequalities
  \[\|\Delta^k f\|_{p} \le C(p,\varepsilon)^k \,d^k\, \|f\|_{2}^{1-\theta}\|f\|_{p+\varepsilon}^{\theta},\qquad k\in \mathbb{N}.\] Analogous inequalities are also proved for $p\in (1,2)$ with $p-\varepsilon$ replacing $p+\varepsilon.$ As a corollary, if $f$ is Boolean-valued or $f\colon \{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,0,1\},$ we obtain the bounds \[\|\Delta^k f\|_{p} \le C(p)^k \,d^k\, \|f\|_p,\qquad k\in \mathbb{N}.\] At the endpoint $p=\infty$ we provide counterexamples for which a linear growth in $d$ does not suffice when $k=1$. We also obtain a counterpart of this result on tail spaces. Namely, for $p&gt;2$ we prove that any function $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \mathbb{C}$ whose spectrum is bounded from below by $d$ satisfies the upper bound on the decay of the heat semigroup
  $$ \|e^{-t\Delta}f\|_{p} \le \exp(-c(p,\varepsilon) td) \|f\|_{2}^{1-\theta}\|f\|_{p+\varepsilon}^{\theta},\qquad t&gt;0,$$ and an analogous estimate for $p\in (1,2).$ The constants $c(p,\varepsilon)$ and $C(p,\varepsilon)$ depend only on $p$ and $\varepsilon$; crucially, they are independent of the dimension $n$.</description>

Abstract: We establish Hermite expansion characterizations for several subspaces of the Fr\'{e}chet space of functions on the real line satisfying \begin{equation*} |f(x)| \lesssim e^{-(\frac{1}{2} - \lambda ) x^{2}} , \qquad | \widehat{f}(\xi )| \lesssim e^{-(\frac{1}{2} - \lambda ) \xi ^{2}} , \qquad \forall \lambda &gt; 0 . \end{equation*} In particular, we extend and improve Fourier characterizations of the so-called proper Pilipovi\'{c} spaces obtained in [J. Funct. Anal. 284 (2023), 109724]. The main ingredients in our proofs are the Bargmann transform and some achieved optimal forms of the Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\"{o}f principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-parameter strongly continuous semigroups of linear bounded operators on Banach spaces (also known as $C_0$-semigroups) are a fundamental operator-theoretic tool used in the study of linear and non-linear evolution PDEs arising in physics, probability, control theory and other areas of science and technology, including quantum theory, transportation problems and finance. Since 2021 the annual online conference on one-parameter semigroups of operators (OPSO) offers an opportunity for researchers worldwide to discuss the current state of the art and exchange knowledge. On every OPSO conference open problems are proposed, collected and discussed, some of them are found to be solved and hence get crossed out from the list. In this paper we provide a collection of open problems of semigroup theory that were proposed by participants of OPSO 2021--2024 conferences and have not been solved, yet. For each problem some comments on the relevance and and history of the problem are provided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the arithmetic Bohr radius of bounded linear operators between arbitrary complex Banach spaces. We establish the close connection between the classical Bohr radius and the arithmetic Bohr radius of bounded linear operators. Further, we study the asymptotic estimates of arithmetic Bohr radius for identity operator on infinite dimensional complex Banach spaces.

      <title>Global approximate controllability of quantum systems by form perturbations and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of infinite-dimensional quantum control systems corresponding to form perturbations of the drift Hamiltonian modulated by a control function. We rely on previous results on controllability of quantum bilinear control systems and obtain a priori $L^1$-bounds of the controls for generic initial and target states. We apply a stability result for the non-autonomous Schr\"odinger equation to extend the results to systems defined by form perturbations, including singular perturbations. As an application of our results, we prove approximate controllability of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional box with a point-interaction with tuneable strength at the centre of the box.</description>
