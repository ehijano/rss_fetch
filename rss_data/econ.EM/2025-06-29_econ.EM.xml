      <title>Optimal Estimation of Two-Way Effects under Limited Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an empirical Bayes estimator for two-way effects in linked data sets based on a novel prior that leverages patterns of assortative matching observed in the data. To capture limited mobility we model the bipartite graph associated with the matched data in an asymptotic framework where its Laplacian matrix has small eigenvalues that converge to zero. The prior hyperparameters that control the shrinkage are determined by minimizing an unbiased risk estimate. We show the proposed empirical Bayes estimator is asymptotically optimal in compound loss, despite the weak connectivity of the bipartite graph and the potential misspecification of the prior. We estimate teacher values-added from a linked North Carolina Education Research Data Center student-teacher data set.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference for Qualitative Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal inference methods such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences are widely used to identify and estimate treatment effects. However, when outcomes are qualitative, their application poses fundamental challenges. This paper highlights these challenges and proposes an alternative framework that focuses on well-defined and interpretable estimands. We show that conventional identification assumptions suffice for identifying the new estimands and outline simple, intuitive estimation strategies that remain fully compatible with conventional econometric methods. We provide an accompanying open-source R package, $\texttt{causalQual}$, which is publicly available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>Daily Fluctuations in Weather and Economic Growth at the Subnational Level: Evidence from Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of daily temperature fluctuations on subnational economic growth in Thailand. Using annual gross provincial product (GPP) per capita data from 1982 to 2022 and high-resolution reanalysis weather data, I estimate fixed-effects panel regressions that isolate plausibly exogenous within-province year-to-year variation in temperature. The results indicate a statistically significant inverted-U relationship between temperature and annual growth in GPP per capita, with adverse effects concentrated in the agricultural sector. Industrial and service outputs appear insensitive to short-term weather variation. Distributed lag models suggest that temperature shocks have persistent effects on growth trajectories, particularly in lower-income provinces with higher average temperatures. I combine these estimates with climate projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios to evaluate province-level economic impacts through 2090. Without adjustments for biases in climate projections or lagged temperature effects, climate change is projected to reduce per capita output for 63-86% of Thai population, with median GDP per capita impacts ranging from -4% to +56% for RCP4.5 and from -52% to -15% for RCP8.5. When correcting for projected warming biases - but omitting lagged dynamics - median losses increase to 57-63% (RCP4.5) and 80-86% (RCP8.5). Accounting for delayed temperature effects further raises the upper-bound estimates to near-total loss. These results highlight the importance of accounting for model uncertainty and temperature dynamics in subnational climate impact assessments. All projections should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for the Direct Average Treatment Effect with Treatment Assignment Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops methods for uncertainty quantification in causal inference settings with random network interference. We study the large-sample distributional properties of the classical difference-in-means Hajek treatment effect estimator, and propose a robust inference procedure for the (conditional) direct average treatment effect. Our framework allows for cross-unit interference in both the outcome equation and the treatment assignment mechanism. Drawing from statistical physics, we introduce a novel Ising model to capture complex dependencies in treatment assignment, and derive three results. First, we establish a Berry-Esseen-type distributional approximation that holds pointwise in the degree of interference induced by the Ising model. This approximation recovers existing results in the absence of treatment interference, and highlights the fragility of inference procedures that do not account for the presence of interference in treatment assignment. Second, we establish a uniform distributional approximation for the Hajek estimator and use it to develop robust inference procedures that remain valid uniformly over all interference regimes allowed by the model. Third, we propose a novel resampling method to implement the robust inference procedure and validate its performance through Monte Carlo simulations. A key technical innovation is the introduction of a conditional i.i.d. Gaussianization that may have broader applications. We also discuss extensions and generalizations of our results.</description>
