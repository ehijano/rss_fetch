      <title>Synthesis of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ bulk samples with high critical current density using a spark plasma sintering technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high density CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ bulk sample was successfully synthesized using a spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The density of the synthesized sample was 5.02 g cm$^{-3}$, corresponding to 96.2% of the theoretical density of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$. Moreover, a reasonably high Vickers hardness of 1 GPa was measured. The electrical resistivity of the SPS bulk sample was as low as approximately 600 $\mu\Omega$ cm at 300 K, which is smaller than that of the ordinary sintered polycrystalline sample by nearly one order of magnitude, and exhibited a sharp superconducting transition, with the transition width $\Delta\textit{T}_c$ less than 2 K, indicating an improved grain connectivity. The critical current density of the SPS bulk sample, as calculated from the magnetization hysteresis loops (magnetic $\textit{J}_c$), reached 18 kA cm$^{-2}$ at 4.2 K under 5 T, which is the highest among the iron-based superconductor polycrystalline samples reported thus far.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of $c$-axis textured CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ superconducting bulk via spark plasma texturing technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain alignment is a key factor that determines the performance of a superconducting bulk. In this study, the spark plasma texturing (SPT) technique was used to fabricate a CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ superconducting bulk. X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction revealed that the $c$-axes of the CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ grains in the SPT bulk are aligned, demonstrating that the SPT technique is effective in achieving $c$-axis texture. In addition, chemical composition analysis showed that oxide impurities, which affect the grain boundary characteristics that determine the inter-grain critical current density ($J_c$), are randomly distributed in the SPT bulk. Magnetization measurements showed high $J_c$ values of the SPT bulk, reaching 127 kA cm$^{-2}$ and 26 kA cm$^{-2}$ at 4.2 K under a self-field and magnetic field of 5 T, respectively. These results suggest that the SPT technique is a promising approach for obtaining a high-performance superconducting bulk material for high-field applications.</description>

      <title>Vortex glass transition and thermal creep in niobium films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the vortex glass (VG) phase transition and vortex creep with decreasing film thickness is studied in ultrathin, polycrystalline niobium films, with thickness in the range 7.4 nm to 44 nm, using current-voltage characteristics measurements in perpendicular magnetic field. Standard methods, including scaling laws, allow to identify VG transition in the thickest film, while in thinner films creep produces large uncertainty in the putative VG transition temperature and scaling exponents. Using strong pinning theory we perform analysis of the creep, and extract the dependence of the activation energy for vortex pinning on temperature, magnetic field, and film thickness. This analysis provides more information on vortex dynamics than the standard evaluation of critical current density. The results reveal two distinct regimes of pinning, which we propose to identify with $\delta l$ or $\delta T_c$-types of pinning (due to spacial fluctuation of mean free path $l$ or spacial fluctuation of superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, respectively). In the thickest film $\delta l$ pinning is observed, but with the decrease of film thickness the second pinning regime appears, and becomes dominant in the thinnest film. We link these pinning regimes with the structural disorder due to grain boundaries, which produce charge carrier scattering in the thickest film, but with decreasing film thickness gradually evolve into amorphous inclusions, producing fluctuations in the $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Scanning quantum vortex microscopy reveals thickness-dependent pinning nano-network in superconducting Nb-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of quantum vortices determines the electromagnetic response of superconducting materials and devices. Controlling the vortex motion, their pinning on intrinsic and artificial defects is therefore essential for superconducting electronics. Here we take advantage of the attractive force between a magnetic cantilever of the Magnetic Force Microscope and a single quantum vortex to spatially map the pinning force inside 50-240 nm thick magnetron-sputtered Nb-films, commonly used in advanced superconducting electronics. The revealed pinning nano-network is related to the thickness-dependent granular structure of the films as well as to the characteristic microscopic scales of superconductivity. Our approach is general, and can be directly applied to other type II granular superconducting materials and nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhancement of the superconducting spin-valve effect via strain-transfer across a ferromagnetic/ferroelectric interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) superconducting spin-valve (SSV), a change of the magnetization alignment of the two F layers modulates the critical temperature (Tc) of the S layer. The Tc-switching (the SSV effect) is based on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. Fast and large resistive switching associated with the Tc-switching is suitable for nonvolatile cryogenic memory applications. However, external magnetic field-based operation of SSVs is hindering their miniaturization, and therefore, electric field control of the SSV effect is desired. Here, we report epitaxial growth of a La0.67Ca0.33MnO3/YBa2Cu3O7/La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 SSV on a piezo-electric [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3]0.7-[PbTiO3]0.3 (001) substrate and demonstrate electric field control of the SSV effect. Electric field-induced strain-transfer from the piezo-electric substrate increases the magnetization and Tc of the SSV, and leads to an enhancement of the magnitude of Tc-switching. The results are promising for the development of magnetic-field-free superconducting spintronic devices, in which the S/F interaction is not only sensitive to the magnetization alignment but also to an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Cavity electrodynamics of van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many-body quantum phenomena that can be tuned in situ using electrostatic gates. These gates are often microstructured graphite flakes that naturally form plasmonic cavities, confining light in discrete standing waves of current density due to their finite size. Their resonances typically lie in the GHz - THz range, corresponding to the same $\mu$eV - meV energy scale characteristic of many quantum effects in the materials they electrically control. This raises the possibility that built-in cavity modes could be relevant for shaping the low-energy physics of vdW heterostructures. However, capturing this light-matter interaction remains elusive as devices are significantly smaller than the diffraction limit at these wavelengths, hindering far-field spectroscopic tools. Here, we report on the sub-wavelength cavity electrodynamics of graphene embedded in a vdW heterostructure plasmonic microcavity. Using on-chip THz spectroscopy, we observed spectral weight transfer and an avoided crossing between the graphite cavity and graphene plasmon modes as the graphene carrier density was tuned, revealing their ultrastrong coupling. Our findings show that intrinsic cavity modes of metallic gates can sense and manipulate the low-energy electrodynamics of vdW heterostructures. This opens a pathway for deeper understanding of emergent phases in these materials and new functionality through cavity control.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological Chalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient heat management at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for superconducting quantum technologies. In this study, we demonstrate the heat diode performance of a gap asymmetric superconducting tunnel junction. Our results show that the mechanism of bipolar thermoelectricity, which occurs when the hot side has the larger gap, boosts heat rectification. This improvement is consistent for a broad range of thermal biases and for different values of the superconducting gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that bipolar thermoelectricity can act as a heat pipe, reducing heat losses towards cold terminals and increasing overall efficiency up to $65\%$. Finally, we show that by adjusting the electrical load, it is possible to tune the heat pipe and diode performances.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism in the high-pressure tetragonal phase of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A structural orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition was recently discovered in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ at a pressure $p^*\simeq3-8$~GPa [Honda \textit{et al.}, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. \textbf{92}, 044702 (2023); Huston \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Mat. \textbf{6}, 114801 (2022)]. In the high-pressure tetragonal phase, a phase transition at $T_x=235$~K and a superconducting transition at $T_{sc}=2$~K have been revealed. In this work, we present an electrical-resistivity study of UTe$_2$ in pulsed magnetic fields up to $\mu_0H=58$~T combined with pressures up to $p$ = 6 GPa. The field was applied in a direction tilted by 30~$^\circ$~from \textbf{b} to \textbf{c} in the orthogonal structure, which is identified as the direction \textbf{c} of the tetragonal structure. In the tetragonal phase, the presence of superconductivity is confirmed and signatures of metamagnetic transitions are observed at the fields $\mu_0H_{x1}=24$~T and $\mu_0H_{x2}=34$~T and temperatures smaller than $T_x$. We discuss the effects of uniaxial pressure and we propose that a magnetic ordering drives the transition at $T_x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets, exhibit a non-relativistically spin-split band structure reminiscent of $d$-wave superconductors, despite the absence of net magnetization. This unique characteristic enables utilization in cryogenic stray-field-free memory devices, offering the possibility of achieving high storage densities. In this Letter, we determine how a proximate altermagnet influences the critical temperature $T_c$ of a conventional $s$-wave singlet superconductor. Considering both a bilayer and trilayer, we show that such hybrid structures may serve as stray-field free memory devices where the critical temperature is controlled by rotating the N\'eel vector of one altermagnet, providing infinite magnetoresistance. Furthermore, our study reveals that altermagnetism can coexist with superconductivity up to a critical strength of the altermagnetic order as well as robustness of the altermagnetic influence on the conduction electrons against non-magnetic impurities, ensuring the persistence of the proximity effect under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Fragility of surface states in non-Wigner Dyson topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators and superconductors support extended surface states protected against the otherwise localizing effects of static disorder. Specifically, in the Wigner-Dyson insulators belonging to the symmetry classes A, AI, and AII, a band of extended surface states is continuously connected to a likewise extended set of bulk states forming a ``bridge'' between different surfaces via the mechanism of spectral flow. In this work we show that this mechanism is absent in the majority of non-Wigner-Dyson topological superconductors and chiral topological insulators. In these systems, there is precisely one point with granted extended states, the center of the band, $E=0$. Away from it, states are spatially localized, or can be made so by the addition of spatially local potentials. Considering the three-dimensional insulator in class AIII and winding number $\nu=1$ as a paradigmatic case study, we discuss the physical principles behind this phenomenon, and its methodological and applied consequences. In particular, we show that low-energy Dirac approximations in the description of surface states can be treacherous in that they tend to conceal the localizability phenomenon. We also identify markers defined in terms of Berry curvature as measures for the degree of state localization in lattice models, and back our analytical predictions by extensive numerical simulations. A main conclusion of this work is that the surface phenomenology of non-Wigner-Dyson topological insulators is a lot richer than that of their Wigner-Dyson siblings, extreme limits being spectrum-wide quantum critical delocalization of all states vs. full localization except at the $E=0$ critical point. As part of our study we identify possible experimental signatures distinguishing between these different alternatives in transport or tunnel spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Phase evolution of Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors under compression: a combined first-principle and effective-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many Ce-based superconductors, superconducting (SC) phases emerge or can be tuned in proximity to the antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum critical point (QCP), but so far the explicit phase evolution near the QCP lack theoretical understanding. Here, by combing the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) with effective-model calculations, we provide a theoretical description for Ce-based superconductors under compression. DFT+DMFT calculations for the normal states reveal that the Kondo hybridizations are significantly enhanced under compression, while the initially localized $f$ electrons become fully itinerant via localized-itinerant crossover. We then construct an effective model and show that with the extracted Kondo coupling and RKKY exchange strengths from first-principle calculations, the ground-state phases of these materials can be properly predicted. We also show that the coexistence of magnetic correlation and Kondo hybridization can drive AF+SC coexisting state in narrow compression region. Under compression, competition between Kondo and RKKY interactions can drive successive transitions, from AF phase to AF+SC coexisting phase, then to paramagnetic SC phase via an AF transition which generates the QCP, and finally to normal Kondo paramagnetic (KP) phase through an SC-KP transition induced by the localized-itinerant crossover. Our study gives proper explanation to the pressure-induced QCP and SC-KP transition, and to the phase evolution in pressured Ce-based superconductors, and can help to understand the SC states around the ferromagnetic quantum transition points in uranium-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Effective model and electron correlations in trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, signatures of superconductivity with critical temperature from 20 to 30 K have been reported in pressured trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ through a pressure-induced structure transition. Here we explore the evolution of electronic structures and electronic correlations in different phases of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under corresponding pressure regions, by using density functional theory (DFT) combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Similar to bilayer superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, the electronic bands in superconducting La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ are dominated by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbits near the Fermi level, in contrast, the inner Ni-O plane in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ generates a doublet hole-pocket Fermi surfaces around the Brillouin-zone corner, meanwhile one branch of the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ bands is pushed very close above the Fermi level, which can induce an electron pocket through small electron doping. The DFT+DMFT simulations suggest that the electronic correlations only give minor modification to the Fermi surfaces, meanwhile the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ states on outer Ni-O layers have considerable greater mass enhancements than on the inner layer. The sensitiveness of electronic structure under doping and unique layer dependence of correlation suggest a distinct superconducting mechanism with respect to bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. Based on the DFT and DFT+DMFT simulations, we eventually derive a trilayer effective tight-binding model, which can produce rather precise electronic bands and Fermi surfaces, hence can serve as an appropriate model to further study the superconducting mechanism and paring symmetry in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.</description>
