      <title>Evaluating cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with spectral variance in the optical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of model fitting. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral variance in a model-independent way. We build upon the work presented in Sharbaf et al. (2023) that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion (100-150 km/s). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral variance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral variance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal and Interpretable Summary Statistics of Galaxy Catalogs with SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much cosmological information can we reliably extract from existing and upcoming large-scale structure observations? Many summary statistics fall short in describing the non-Gaussian nature of the late-time Universe in comparison to existing and upcoming measurements. In this article we demonstrate that we can identify optimal summary statistics and that we can link them with existing summary statistics. Using simulation based inference (SBI) with automatic data-compression, we learn summary statistics for galaxy catalogs in the context of cosmological parameter estimation. By construction these summary statistics do not require the ability to write down an explicit likelihood. We demonstrate that they can be used for efficient parameter inference. These summary statistics offer a new avenue for analyzing different simulation models for baryonic physics with respect to their relevance for the resulting cosmological features. The learned summary statistics are low-dimensional, feature the underlying simulation parameters, and are similar across different network architectures. To link our models, we identify the relevant scales associated to our summary statistics (e.g. in the range of modes between $k= 5 - 30 h/\mathrm{Mpc}$) and we are able to match the summary statistics to underlying simulation parameters across various simulation models.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Large-Scale Anisotropies on Galaxy Clustering and Cosmological Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically assess the impact of significant dipole and large-scale anisotropies on galaxy clustering signals, with a focus on radio continuum surveys. Our study reveals that these anisotropies -- resulting from intrinsic cosmological effects and/or observational systematics -- profoundly influence the two-point correlation function (2PCF) and angular power spectrum ($C_\ell$). Notably, large-scale anisotropies can obscure or simulate non-Gaussianity signals, complicating the extraction of precise cosmological information. The results emphasize that it is crucial to address systematics and rigorously mask the dipole and its surrounding multipoles to obtain accurate cosmological constraints. This approach is essential for extracting cosmological results from clustering signals, particularly for future surveys such as SKA, DESI, and LSST, to ensure the precision and reliability of cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of lensed type Ia supernovae with color-magnitude selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique cosmological probe to address the Hubble tension problem in cosmology. In addition to the sensitivity of the time delays to the value of the Hubble constant, the transient and standard candle nature of SNe Ia also enable valuable joint constraints on the model of the lens and the cosmological parameters. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase the number of observed SNe Ia by an order of magnitude in ten years of its lifetime. However, finding such systems in the LSST data is a challenge. In this work, we revisit the color-magnitude (CM) diagram used previously as a means to identify lensed SNe Ia and extend the work further as follows. We simulate LSST-like photometric data ($rizy$~bands) of lensed SNe Ia and analyze it in the CM parameter space. We find that a subset of lensed SNe Ia are redder compared to unlensed SNe Ia at a given magnitude, both in the rising and falling phases of their light curves and for SNe up to $z=3$. We propose a modified selection criterion based on these new results. We show that the contamination coming from the unlensed core-collapse (CC) SNe is negligible, whereas a small fraction of lensed CC SNe types Ib and Ic may get selected by this criterion as potential lensed SNe. Finally, we demonstrate that our criterion works well on a wide sample of observed unlensed SNe Ia, a handful of known multiply-imaged lensed SNe systems, and a representative sample of observed super-luminous supernovae.</description>

      <title>HI Intensity Mapping cross-correlation with thermal SZ fluctuations: forecasted cosmological parameters estimation for FAST and Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen surveys holds great potential as a valuable method for exploring the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this paper, we forecast for the cross-correlation between the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) fluctuations as probed by the Planck satellite, and fluctuations in the HI brightness temperature as probed by the ground-based Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), to trace the connection between galaxy clusters and the HI large-scale structure. Assuming that the measurement is limited by instrumental noise rather than by foreground, we estimate the potential detectability of the cross-correlation signal and their improvement in the measurement of the HI cosmic density, the hydrostatic mass bias parameter, and the universal pressure profile (UPP) parameters. We obtain a constraint on the cosmic neutral hydrogen density parameter significantly to $\sigma(\Omega_{\rm HI}) = 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$. We also find that the average halo masses contributing to the ${{\rm HI}-y}$ cross-power spectrum in the one-halo regime is $\sim 1.5\times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. Our results also show that the HI-SZ cross-correlation has great potential to probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) within halos at low redshift.</description>

      <title>The Redshift-Space Momentum Power Spectrum III: measuring the growth rate from the SDSSv survey using auto- and cross- power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution over time contains an abundance of cosmological information. One way to unlock this is by measuring the density and momentum power spectrum from the positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies, and fitting the cosmological parameters from these power spectrum. In this paper, we will explore the cross power spectrum between the density and momentum fields of galaxies. We derive the estimator of the density-momentum cross power spectrum multipoles. The growth rate of the large-scale-structure, $f\sigma_8$ is measured from fitting the combined density monopole, momentum monopole and cross dipole power spectrum. The estimators and models of power spectrum as well as our fitting method have been tested using mock catalogues, and we find that they perform well in recovering the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters of the simulations, and we also find that the errors of the parameters can be largely reduced by including the cross-power spectrum in the fit. We measure the auto-density, auto-momentum and cross power spectrum using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 peculiar velocity catalogue. The fit result of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ is $f\sigma_8=0.413^{+0.050}_{-0.058}$ at effective redshift $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.073$, and our measurement is consistent with the prediction of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model assuming General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Atomic Dark Matter, Interacting Dark Radiation, and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of interacting dark sector models that can address the Hubble tension. Interacting dark radiation (DR) has previously been put forward as a solution to the problem, but this proposal is disfavored by the high-$\ell$ cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We modify this basic framework by introducing a subcomponent of dark matter (DM) that interacts strongly with the DR, so that together they constitute a tightly coupled fluid at early times. We show that if this subcomponent decouples from the interacting DR during the CMB epoch, the $\ell$ modes of the CMB that entered the horizon before decoupling are impacted differently from those that entered after, allowing a solution to the problem. We present a model that realizes this framework, which we dub "New Atomic Dark Matter", or nuADaM, in which the interacting dark matter (iDM) subcomponent is composed of dark atoms, and dark "neutrinos" with long-range interactions contribute to the DR, hence the name of the model. This iDM subcomponent is acoustic at early times but decouples from the DR following dark recombination. In contrast to conventional atomic dark matter (ADM) models, the dark photon is part of a richer DR sector, which ensures that it continues to be self-interacting even after recombination. We show that this model admits a fit to the available cosmological data that is significantly better than both $\Lambda$CDM and conventional ADM.</description>

      <title>Does the fluid-static equilibrium of a self-gravitating isothermal sphere of van der Waals' gas present multiple solutions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take up the investigation we had to put in the future-work stack at the end of Sec.VB2 of Ref.2, in which we pointed out the obvious necessity to inquire about existence or absence of values of the characteristic numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in correspondence to which the perfect-gas model's self gravitational effects, namely upper boundedness of the gravitational number, spiraling behavior of peripheral density, oscillating behavior of central density, and existence of multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number, appear also for the van der Waals' model. The development of our investigation brings to the conversion of our M$_{2}$ scheme based on a second-order differential equation into an equivalent system of two first-order differential equations that incorporates Milne's homology invariant variables. The converted scheme 1oM$_2$ turns out to be much more efficacious than the M$_{2}$ scheme in terms of numerical calculations' easiness and richness of results. We use the perfect-gas model as benchmark to test the 1oM$_2$ scheme; we re-derive familiar results and put them in a more general and rational perspective that paves the way to deal with the van der Waals' gas model. We introduce variable transformations that turn out to be the key to study (almost) analytically the monotonicity of the peripheral density with respect to variations of the gravitational number. The study brings to the proof that the gravitational number is not constrained by upper boundedness, the peripheral density does not spiral, and the central density does not oscillate for any couple of values assumed by the characteristic numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$; however, multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number can exist but their genesis is completely different from that of the perfect-gas model's multiple solutions. We provide the boundary in the $\alpha,\beta$ plane between the two regions of solution's uniqueness and multiplicity. Finally, by the application of the 1oM$_2$ scheme, we resolve the mystery of the missing steep curve corresponding to Aronson and Hansen's 60km case [29] that we unsuccessfully chased in Ref.2 and we even detect another solution that had somehow escaped the attention of those authors.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: tracking the expansion and merger histories of ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of ionized hydrogen bubbles in the intergalactic medium around early luminous objects is a fundamental process during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In this study, we analyze bubble sizes and their evolution using the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation throughout a large (95.5 cMpc)^3 volume of the Universe. Analogous to the accretion and merger tree histories employed in galaxy formation simulations, we characterize the growth and merger rates of ionized bubbles by focusing on the spatially-resolved redshift of reionization. By tracing the chronological expansion of bubbles, we partition the simulation volume and construct a natural ionization history. We identify three distinct stages of ionized bubble growth: (1) initial slow expansion around the earliest ionizing sources seeding formation sites, (2) accelerated growth through percolation as bubbles begin to merge, and (3) rapid expansion dominated by the largest bubble. Notably, we find that the largest bubble emerges by z=9-10, well before the midpoint of reionization. This bubble becomes dominant during the second growth stage, and defines the third stage by rapidly expanding to eventually encompass the remainder of the simulation volume and becoming one of the few bubbles actively growing. Additionally, we observe a sharp decline in the number of bubbles with radii around ~10 cMpc compared to smaller sizes, indicating a characteristic scale in the final segmented bubble size distribution. Overall, these chronologically sequenced spatial reconstructions offer crucial insights into the physical mechanisms driving ionized bubble growth during the EoR and provide a framework for interpreting the structure and evolution of reionization itself.</description>

      <title>Perturbative gravitational wave predictions for the real-scalar extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a state-of-the-art study of the cosmological phase transitions of the real-scalar extended Standard Model. We carry out a broad scan of the parameter space of this model at next-to-next-to-leading order in powers of couplings. We use effective field theory to account for the necessary higher-order resummations, and to construct consistent real and gauge-invariant gravitational wave predictions. Our results provide a comprehensive account of the convergence of perturbative predictions for the gravitational wave signals in this model. For the majority of the parameter points in our study, we observe apparent convergence. While leading and next-to-leading order predictions of the gravitational wave amplitude typically suffer from relative errors between $10$ and $10^4$, at next-to-next-to-leading order the typical relative errors are reduced to between $0.5$ and $50$. Nevertheless, for those parameter points predicting the largest signals, potentially observable by future gravitational wave observatories, the validity of the perturbative expansion is in doubt.</description>

      <title>Reconciling concentration to virial mass relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concentration-virial mass (c-M) relation is a fundamental scaling relation within the standard cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework well established in numerical simulations. However, observational constraints of this relation are hampered by the difficulty of characterising the properties of dark matter haloes. Recent comparisons between simulations and observations have suggested a systematic difference of the c-M relation, with higher concentrations in the latter. In this work, we undertake detailed comparisons between simulated galaxies and observations of a sample of strong-lensing galaxies. We explore several factors of the comparison with strong gravitational lensing constraints, including the choice of the generic dark matter density profile, the effect of radial resolution, the reconstruction limits of observed versus simulated mass profiles, and the role of the initial mass function in the derivation of the dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we show the dependence of the c-M relation on reconstruction and model errors through a detailed comparison of real and simulated gravitational lensing systems. An effective reconciliation of simulated and observed c-M relations can be achieved if one considers less strict assumptions on the dark matter profile, for example, by changing the slope of a generic NFW profile or focusing on rather extreme combinations of stellar-to-dark matter distributions. A minor effect is inherent to the applied method: fits to the NFW profile on a less well-constrained inner mass profile yield slightly higher concentrations and lower virial masses.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation from non-evaporating primordial black holes cannot enable the formation of direct collapse black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe is a subject of significant debate. In this study, we examine whether non-evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) can offer a solution. We establish initial constraints on the range of PBH masses that correspond to Hawking radiation (HR) effective temperatures in the range needed to avoid the fragmentation of primordial gas into smaller, stellar-mass black holes. We also investigate the specific intensity of the HR from non-evaporating PBHs and compare it with the critical radiation needed for direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). We show that HR from non-evaporating PBHs cannot serve as the heating mechanism to facilitate the formation of the seeds for the SMBHs we observe in the high-redshift Universe unless, perhaps, the PBHs within the relevant mass range comprise a significant fraction of dark matter and are significantly clustered towards the center of the primordial halo.</description>

      <title>Detection of an orthogonal alignment between parsec scale AGN jets and their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs with the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and optical images of their host galaxies. We compare the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total 6273 galaxy-AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys data (DESI LS) is significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS, with which 5853 galaxy-AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (with a p-value $\leqslant$ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kpc projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over 3 orders of magnitude in scale. This points towards an intimate connection between the SMBH, their host galaxies and their subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Carl Wirtz' article from 1924 in Astronomische Nachrichten on the radial motions of spiral nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the year 1924, a paper by Carl Wirtz appeared in Astronomische Nachrichten, entitled 'De Sitter's cosmology and the radial motion of spiral galaxies'. This paper and its author remained largely unnoticed by the community, but it seems to be the first cosmological interpretation of the redshift of galaxies as a time dilation effect and the expansion of the Universe. Edwin Hubble knew Wirtz' publications quite well. The modern reader would find Wirtz' own understanding diffuse and contradictory in some aspects, but that reflected the early literature on nebulae, to which he himself made important contributions. The 100th anniversary provides a good opportunity to present an English transcription to the community, which can be found in the appendix. This anniversary also provokes to ask for the present status of cosmology which many authors see in a crisis. From an observational viewpoint it shall be illustrated that until today there is no consistent/convincing understanding of how the Universe evolved.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes for nonstandard cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the bounds on the abundance of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the constraints on power spectrum are modified if a non-standard evolution phase takes place between the end of inflation and the Standard radiation-dominated (RD) universe after inflation. The constraints on PBH abundance and power spectrum are computed using the new, freely available, \href{https://github.com/TadeoDGAguilar/PBHBeta}{\faGithubSquare}~\texttt{PBHBeta} library, which accounts for the effects of non-standard expansion and specific criteria for PBH formation in such non-standard scenarios. As working examples, we consider three different cases: a pure matter-dominated (MD) phase, a scalar field-dominated ($\varphi$D) universe, and a stiff fluid-dominated (SD) scenario. While the background expansion is the same for the MD and $\varphi$D scenarios, the PBH formation criteria lead to different constraints to power spectrum. On the other hand, the duration of the non-standard expansion phase alters the bounds, with longer MD periods resulting in weaker constraints on power spectrum, and longer SD scenarios leading to an enhanced abundance due to the dust-like redshifting of PBHs. The modifications to the constraints are reported in all cases and we highlight those where the power spectrum may be significantly constrained.</description>

      <title>CMB-HD as a Probe of Dark Matter on Sub-Galactic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show for the first time that high-resolution CMB lensing observations can probe structure on sub-galactic scales. In particular, a CMB-HD experiment can probe out to k ~ 55 h/Mpc, corresponding to halo masses of about $10^8 M_{\odot}$. Over the range 0.005 h/Mpc &lt; k &lt; 55 h/Mpc, spanning four orders of magnitude, the total lensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra is greater than 1900. CMB-HD gains most of the lensing SNR at small scales from the temperature power spectrum, as opposed to the lensing spectrum. These lensing measurements allow CMB-HD to distinguish between cold dark matter (CDM) and non-CDM models that change the matter power spectrum on sub-galactic scales. We also find that CMB-HD can distinguish between baryonic feedback effects and non-CDM models due to the different way each impacts the lensing signal. The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum further constrains non-CDM models that deviate from CDM on the smallest scales CMB-HD measures. For example, CMB-HD can detect 1 keV warm dark matter (WDM) at 30$\sigma$, or rule out about 7 keV WDM at 95% CL, in a $\Lambda$WDM + $N_{\rm{eff}} + \sum m_\nu + m_{\rm{WDM}} + \log_{10}T_{\rm{AGN}} + A_{\rm{kSZ}} + n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ model; here $T_{\rm{AGN}}$ characterizes the strength of the feedback, and $A_{\rm{kSZ}}$ and $n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ allow freedom in the amplitude and slope of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. This work provides an initial exploration of what can be achieved with reasonable assumptions about systematic effects. We make the CMB-HD Fisher code used here publicly available, and note that it can be modified to use any non-CDM model that changes the matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Warm inflation with a heavy QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first model of warm inflation in which the particle production emerges directly from coupling the inflaton to Standard Model particles. Warm inflation, an early epoch of sustained accelerated expansion at finite temperature, is a compelling alternative to cold inflation, with distinct predictions for inflationary observables such as the amplitude of fluctuations, the spectral tilt, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and non-gaussianities. In our model a heavy QCD axion acts as the warm inflaton whose coupling to Standard Model gluons sources the thermal bath during warm inflation. Axion-like couplings to non-Abelian gauge bosons have been considered before as a successful microphysical theory with emerging thermal friction that can maintain finite temperature during inflation via sphaleron heating. However, the presence of light fermions charged under the non-Abelian group suppresses particle production, hindering a realization of warm inflation by coupling to QCD. We point out that the Standard Model quarks can be heavy during warm inflation if the Higgs field resides in a high-energy second minimum which restores efficient sphaleron heating. A subsequent large reheating temperature is required to allow the Higgs field to relax to its electroweak minimum.
  Exploring a scenario in which hybrid warm inflation provides the large reheating temperature, we show that future collider and beam dump experiments have discovery potential for a heavy QCD axion taking the role of the warm inflaton.</description>

      <title>Violent starbursts and quiescence induced by FUV radiation feedback in metal-poor galaxies at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04824</link>

Abstract: JWST observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 8$ suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., $\mathrm{H_2}$ dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$) until they reach a relatively high density ($\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder ($\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Xu &amp; Jing (2022) reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass $M_h$ and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index $n$, at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of $11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7$, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on $n$, we confirm a positive correlation between $n$ and $M_h$, and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of $n$ and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between $M_h$ and $n$. Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive $n-M_h$ relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.</description>
