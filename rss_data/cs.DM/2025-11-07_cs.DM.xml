      <title>Induced matching treewidth and tree-independence number, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two graph parameters defined via tree decompositions: tree-independence number and induced matching treewidth. Both parameters are defined similarly as treewidth, but with respect to different measures of a tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph $G$: for tree-independence number, the measure is the maximum size of an independent set in $G$ included in some bag of $\mathcal{T}$, while for the induced matching treewidth, the measure is the maximum size of an induced matching in $G$ such that some bag of $\mathcal{T}$ contains at least one endpoint of every edge of the matching.
  While the induced matching treewidth of any graph is bounded from above by its tree-independence number, the family of complete bipartite graphs shows that small induced matching treewidth does not imply small tree-independence number. On the other hand, Abrishami, Bria\'nski, Czy\.zewska, McCarty, Milani\v{c}, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, and Walczak~[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2025] showed that, if a fixed biclique $K_{t,t}$ is excluded as an induced subgraph, then the tree-independence number is bounded from above by some function of the induced matching treewidth. The function resulting from their proof is exponential even for fixed $t$, as it relies on multiple applications of Ramsey's theorem. In this note we show, using the K\"ov\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem, that for any class of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, the two parameters are in fact polynomially related.</description>

      <title>Depth-13 Sorting Networks for 28 Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new depth upper bounds for sorting networks on 27 and 28 channels, improving the previous best bound of 14 to 13. Our 28-channel network is constructed with reflectional symmetry by combining high-quality prefixes of 16- and 12-channel networks, extending them greedily one comparator at a time, and using a SAT solver to complete the remaining layers.</description>

      <title>Boolean function monotonicity testing requires (almost) $n^(1/2)$ queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any constant $c&gt;0$, any (two-sided error) adaptive algorithm for testing monotonicity of Boolean functions must have query complexity $\Omega(n^{1/2-c})$. This improves the $\tilde\Omega(n^{1/3})$ lower bound of [CWX17] and almost matches the $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound of [KMS18].</description>

      <title>An exact approach for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "avoid - shift - improve" framework and the European Clean Vehicles Directive set the path for improving the efficiency and ultimately decarbonizing the transport sector. While electric buses have already been adopted in several cities, regional bus lines may pose additional challenges due to the potentially longer distances they have to travel. In this work, we model and solve the electric bus scheduling problem, lexicographically minimizing the size of the bus fleet, the number of charging stops, and the total energy consumed, to provide decision support for bus operators planning to replace their diesel-powered fleet with zero emission vehicles. We propose a graph representation which allows partial charging without explicitly relying on time variables and derive 3-index and 2-index mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem. While the 3-index model can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver directly, the 2-index model relies on an exponential number of constraints to ensure the correct depot pairing. These are separated in a cutting plane fashion. We propose a set of instances with up to 80 service trips to compare the two approaches, showing that, with a small number of depots, the compact 3-index model performs very well. However, as the number of depots increases the developed branch-and-cut algorithm proves to be of value. These findings not only offer algorithmic insights but the developed approaches also provide actionable guidance for transit agencies and operators, allowing to quantify trade-offs between fleet size, energy efficiency, and infrastructure needs under realistic operational conditions.</description>

      <title>On zeros and algorithms for disordered systems: mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>
