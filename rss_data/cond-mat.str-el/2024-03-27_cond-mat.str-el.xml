      <title>Strain-induced enhancement of the charge-density-wave in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome geometry is an example of frustrated configuration in which rich physics takes place, including the emergence of superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW). Among the kagome metals, ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ hosts an unconventional CDW, with its electronic order showing a different periodicity than that of the phonon which generates it. In this material, a CDW-softened flat phonon band has a second-order collapse at the same time that the first order transition occurs. This phonon band originates from the out-of-plane vibrations of the Sc and Sn atoms, and it is at the base of the electron-phonon-coupling driven CDW phase of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Here, we use uniaxial strain to tune the frequency of the flat phonon band, tracking the strain evolution via time-resolved optical spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. Our findings emphasize the capability to induce an enhancement of the unconventional CDW properties in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metal through control of strain.</description>

      <title>Collective modes and Raman response in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the collective response in an excitonic insulator phase in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ using a semirealistic model including relevant lattice and electronic instabilities. We calculate order-parameter susceptibility and Raman response within a time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach. Contrary to the standard expectations, the amplitude mode frequency does not coincide with the single-particle gap but has a higher frequency. We find a phase mode that is massive because the excitonic condensation breaks a discrete symmetry only and that becomes heavier as the electron-lattice coupling is increased. These features are expected to apply to generic realistic excitonic insulators. We discuss scenarios under which the phase mode does not appear as a sharp in-gap resonance.</description>

      <title>Extreme Terahertz Magnon Multiplication Induced by Resonant Magnetic Pulse Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear interactions of spin-waves and their quanta, magnons, have emerged as prominent candidates for interference-based technology, ranging from quantum transduction to antiferromagnetic spintronics. Yet magnon multiplication in the terahertz (THz) spectral region represents a major challenge. Intense, resonant magnetic fields from THz pulse-pairs with controllable phases and amplitudes enable high order THz magnon multiplication, distinct from non-resonant nonlinearities such as the high harmonic generation by below-band gap electric fields. Here, we demonstrate exceptionally high-order THz nonlinear magnonics. It manifests as 7$^\text{th}$-order spin-wave-mixing and 6$^\text{th}$ harmonic magnon generation in an antiferromagnetic orthoferrite. We use THz multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy to achieve high-sensitivity detection of nonlinear magnon interactions up to six-magnon quanta in strongly-driven many-magnon correlated states. The high-order magnon multiplication, supported by classical and quantum spin simulations, elucidates the significance of four-fold magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya symmetry breaking. Moreover, our results shed light on the potential quantum fluctuation properties inherent in nonlinear magnons.</description>

      <title>Observation of nodal-arcs, effect of axial strain on the nodal-lines &amp; Weyl nodes and low-temperature finite value of Seebeck coefficient in TaAs class of Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work verifies the SOC-induced evolution of \textit{nodal-arcs} into Weyl nodes under the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in NbAs \&amp; NbP. The obtained features mimics the observations as reported for TaAs \&amp; TaP in our previous work\cite{pandey2023existence}. In addition, this work reports that the number of nodes in TaAs class of Weyl semimetals (WSMs) can be altered via creating strain along $a$ or $c$ direction of the crystal. For instance, the number of nodes in NbAs under SOC-effect along with 2\% (3\%) compressive-strain in $a$ direction is found to be 20 (28). Besides the nodes, such strain are found to have considerable impact on the nodal-rings of these WSMs when effect of SOC is ignored. Apart from this, the work discusses the role of Weyl physics in affecting the Seebeck coefficient of any WSM. In this direction, it is discussed that how a symmetric Weyl cone, even if tilted, have no contribution to the Seebeck of WSMs. Furthermore, the work highlights the conditions under which a Weyl cone can contribute to the Seebeck coefficient of a given WSM. Lastly, the discussion of Weyl contribution to Seebeck is validated over TaAs class of WSMs via investigating the features of its Weyl cones and calculating the contributions of these cones to the Seebeck coefficient of these semimetals. The value of $S$ contributed from Weyl cone is found to be as large as $\sim$65 $\mu$\textit{V}/\textit{K} below 25 K in case of TaAs. The findings of this work present a possibility of engineering the topological properties of TaAs class of WSMs via creating strain in their crystal. It also makes the picture of Weyl physics\textquoteright\hspace{0.1cm} impact on the Seebeck coefficient of WSMs a more clear.</description>

      <title>Floquet Product Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results are presented for the dynamics of edge modes in interacting Floquet Ising chains. It is shown that in addition to the quasi-stable $0$ and $\pi$ edge modes, a third long lived edge mode arising from the operator product of the $0$ and $\pi$ edge modes exists. Depending on the microscopic parameters, this Floquet product mode is shown to have a substantially longer lifetime than the individual $0$ and $\pi$ modes. This is triggered by a scattering process which converts a $0$ mode into a $\pi$ mode while scattering two bulk excitations. This process can lead to a rapid decay of both $0$ and $\pi$ mode without affecting the product mode.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

      <title>$J_{eff}$ states in a quasi one dimensional antiferromagnetic spin chain hexagonal Iridates Sr$_3$MIrO$_6$ (M=Mg, Zn, Cd): an $ab-initio$ comparative perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ first-principles density-functional theory, to perform a comparative investigation of the effect of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the electronic and magnetic properties of three experimentally synthesized and characterized hexagonal perovskites Sr$_3$MIrO$_6$(M=Mg, Zn, Cd). The electronic structure calculations show that in all the compounds, Ir is the only magnetically active site in +4[5$d^5$] configuration, whereas M$^{+2}$ (M=Cd, Zn, Mg), remains in nonmagnetic states with Cd/Zn and Mg featuring $d^{10}$ and $d^{0}$ electronic configurations, respectively. The insulating gap could be opened by switching on the correlation parameter $U$ for Sr$_3$CdrO$_6$ and Sr$_3$ZnIrO$_6$ which qualifies it to be a correlated Mott insulator. However, in the case of Sr$_3$MgIrO$_6$ both $U$ and antiferromagnetic ordering is not enough and the gap could only be opened by including the SOC which classifies it to fall under the category of a typical SOC Mott insulator. The $j_{eff}$ states are visualized from the orbital projected band structure. The magnetism is studied from the point of view of exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the presence of the SOC. We also present the comparative analysis of the renormalized impact of SOC on the three compounds, which shows that all the three compounds fall under the $intermediate$ coupling regime, where Sr$_3$MgIrO$_6$ is comparatively closer to the atomic $j_{eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ picture from the others.</description>

      <title>Existence and role of low energy charge-paramagnon modes in the strange metal phase of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+y}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strange metal phase is characteristic for the $T$-linear dc resistivity behaviour over a large $T$-range. The effect of the strength of the charge-paramagnon interactions on the charge fluctuations in optimally doped and underdoped regions of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+y}$ (Bi-2212) may shine light on the anomalous behaviour of the optical conductivity response in the energy range 50 - 500 meV. We present a preliminary analysis of a single initial run of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements done in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) which exhibit linear dispersive modes separated by 50 meV energy gaps up to 250 meV in optimally doped Bi-2212. Our observations show similarities with the fluctuating stripes as predicted by Zaanen.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in competing phases in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting (SC), charge-density wave (CDW), and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases in the extended Hubbard model at zero temperature and half-filling. We employ the iterated equations of motion approach to compute the two-particle Green's functions and their spectral densities. This renders a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of collective excitations possible as the model's parameters are tuned across phase transitions. We identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) and phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) modes within the superconducting phase and observe a similar excitation (cooperon) in the CDW phase which shifts towards zero energy as the system approaches the phase transition to the SC phase. In the CDW phase, close to the phase transition to the AFM phase, we find a collective mode, an exciton, that does not change significantly and another mode, a longitudinal magnon, that emerges from the two-particle continuum as the system approaches the phase transition to the AFM phase. It becomes identical with the former at the transition. In the AFM phase, their roles are reversed. Additionally, we find a transversal Goldstone magnon located at zero energy.</description>

      <title>Hydroflux-Controlled Growth of Magnetic K-Cu-Te-O(H) Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovative synthetic approaches can yield new phases containing novel structural and magnetic motifs. In this work, we show the synthesis and magnetic characterization of three new and one previously reported layered phase in the K-Cu-Te-O(H) phase space using a tunable hydroflux technique. The hydroflux, with a roughly equal molar ratio of water and alkali hydroxide, is a highly oxidizing, low melting solvent which can be used to isolate metastable phases unattainable through traditional solid state or flux techniques. The newly synthesized phases, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, and K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O, contain Cu$^{2+}$ within CuO$_{4}$ square planar plaquettes and TeO$_{6}$ octahedra ordering to form structural honeycomb layers isolated by interlayer K$^{+}$ ions and H$_{2}$O molecules. We find the synthesized structures display varying tilt sequences of the CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes, leading to distinct Cu$^{2+}$ magnetic motifs on the structural honeycomb lattice and a range of effective magnetic dimensionalities. We find that K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O does not order and displays alternating chain Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior, while K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ and K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O order antiferromagnetically (T$_{N}$ = 100 K and T$_{N}$ = 6.5 K respectively). The previously known phase, K$_{2}$CuTeO$_{4}$(OH)$_{2}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, we find contains structurally and magnetically one-dimensional CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes leading to uniform chain Heisenberg AFM behavior and shows no magnetic order down to T = 0.4 K. We discuss and highlight the usefulness of the hydroflux technique in novel syntheses and the interesting magnetic motifs that arise in these particular phases.</description>

      <title>Signatures of electronic ordering in transport in graphene flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a wide family of electronic orders was unveiled in graphene flat bands, such as spin- and valley-polarized phases as well as nematic momentum-polarized phases, stabilized by exchange interactions via a generalized Stoner mechanism. Momentum polarization involves orbital degrees of freedom and is therefore expected to impact resistivity in a way which is uniquely sensitive to the ordering type. Under pocket polarization, carrier distribution shifts in k space and samples the band mass in regions defined by the displaced momentum distribution. This makes transport coefficients sensitive to pocket polarization, resulting in the ohmic resistivity decreasing with temperature. In addition, it leads to current switching and hysteresis under strong E field. This behavior remains robust in the presence of electron-phonon scattering and is therefore expected to be generic.</description>

      <title>Coherent Modulation of Two-Dimensional Moir\'e States with On-Chip THz Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) structures of two-dimensional materials host a broad range of physical phenomena. New opportunities arise if different functional layers may be remotely modulated or coupled in a device structure. Here we demonstrate the in-situ coherent modulation of moir\'e excitons and correlated Mott insulators in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homo- or hetero-bilayers with on-chip terahertz (THz) waves. Using common dual-gated device structures, each consisting of a TMD moir\'e bilayer sandwiched between two few-layer graphene (fl-Gr) gates with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) spacers, we launch coherent phonon wavepackets at ~0.4-1 THz from the fl-Gr gates by femtosecond laser excitation. The waves travel through the h-BN spacer, arrive at the TMD bilayer with precise timing, and coherently modulate the moir\'e excitons or the Mott states. These results demonstrate that the fl-Gr gates, often used for electrical control of the material properties, can serve as effective on-chip opto-elastic transducers to generate THz waves for the coherent control and vibrational entanglement of functional layers in commonly used moir\'e devices.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK) in which the Hamiltonian is the position operator of the Harmonic oscillator. This model captures the high temperature limit of DSSYK but could also be defined as a quantum theory in its own right. We study properties of the emergent geometry including its dynamics in response to inserting matter particles. In particular, we find that the model displays de Sitter-like properties such as that infalling matter reduces the rate of growth of geodesic slices between the two boundaries. The simplicity of the model allows us to compute the full generating functional for correlation functions of the length mode or any number of matter operators. We provide evidence that the effective action of the geodesic length between boundary points is non-local. Furthermore, we use the on-shell solution for the geodesic lengths between any two boundary points to reconstruct an effective bulk metric and reverse engineer the dilaton gravity theory that generates this metric as a solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Building defect conformal field theory from the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

      <title>Physical and unphysical regimes of self-consistent many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard framework of self-consistent many-body perturbation theory, the skeleton series for the self-energy is truncated at a finite order $\mathcal{N}$ and plugged into the Dyson equation, which is then solved for the propagator $G_{\mathcal{N}}\,$. We consider two examples of fermionic models, the Hubbard atom at half filling and its zero space-time dimensional simplified version. First, we show that $G_{\mathcal{N}}\,$ converges when $\mathcal{N}\to\infty$ to a limit $G_\infty\,$, which coincides with the exact physical propagator $G_{\rm exact}\ $ at small enough coupling, while $G_\infty \neq G_{\rm exact}\ $ at strong coupling. This follows from the findings of [Kozik, Ferrero and Georges, PRL 114, 156402 (2015)] and an additional subtle mathematical mechanism elucidated here. Second, we demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate between the $G_\infty=G_{\rm exact}\ $ and $G_\infty\neq G_{\rm exact}\ $ regimes thanks to a criterion which does not require the knowledge of $G_{\rm exact}\ $, as proposed in [Rossi et al., PRB 93, 161102(R) (2016)].</description>

      <title>Depth-dependent magnetic crossover in a room-temperature skyrmion-hosting multilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmion-hosting multilayer stacks are promising avenues for applications, although little is known about the depth dependence of the magnetism. We address this by reporting the results of circular dichroic resonant elastic x-ray scattering (CD-REXS), micromagnetic simulations, and low-energy muon-spin rotation (LE-$\mu^+$SR) measurements on a stack comprising [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]$_{16}$/Ta on a Si substrate. Energy-dependent CD-REXS shows a continuous, monotonic evolution of the domain-wall helicity angle with incident energy, consistent with a three-dimensional hybrid domain-wall-like structure that changes from N\'eel-like near the surface to Bloch-like deeper within the sample. LE-$\mu^+$SR reveals that the magnetic field distribution in the trilayers near the surface of the stack is distinct from that in trilayers deeper within the sample. Our micromagnetic simulations support a quantitative analysis of the $\mu^+$SR results. By increasing the applied magnetic field, we find a reduction in the volume occupied by domain walls at all depths, consistent with a crossover into a region dominated by skyrmions above approximately 180 mT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced topological heavy fermion model (THFM) provides a means for interpreting the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom of the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene as hybridization amidst highly dispersing topological conduction and weakly dispersing localized heavy fermions. In order to understand the Landau quantization of the ensuing electronic spectrum, a generalization of THFM to include the magnetic field B is desired, but currently missing. Here we provide a systematic derivation of the THFM in B and solve the resulting model to obtain the interacting Hofstadter spectra for single particle charged excitations. While naive minimal substitution within THFM fails to correctly account for the total number of magnetic subbands within the narrow band i.e. its total Chern number, our method -- based on projecting the light and heavy fermions onto the irreducible representations of the magnetic translation group -- reproduces the correct total Chern number. Analytical results presented here offer an intuitive understanding of the nature of the (strongly interacting) Hofstadter bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the composite operator method (COM) to analyze the strongly correlated repulsive Hubbard model, investigating the effect of nearest-neighbor hoppings up to fourth order on a square lattice. We consider two sets of self-consistent equations, one enforcing the Pauli principle and the other imposing charge-charge, spin-spin, and pair-pair correlations using a decoupling scheme developed by L. Roth. We extract three distinct solutions from these equations: COM1 and COM2 by imposing the Pauli principle and one from Roth decoupling. An overview of the method studying the validity of particle-hole symmetry and the Luttinger theorem for each solution is presented. Additionally, we extend the initial basis to study superconductivity, concluding that it is induced by the Van Hove singularity. Finally, we include higher-order hoppings using realistic estimates for tight binding parameters and compare our results with ARPES measurements on cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Parafermion zero modes can arise in hybrid structures composed of $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edges proximitized with an s-wave superconductor. Here we consider parafermion and Cooper pair tunneling, and backscattering in a junction formed in such hybrid structures. We find that the $4\pi m$ periodicity due to parafermion-only tunneling reduces, in the presence of backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear signature of parafermion tunneling remains in the shape of the current-phase relation.</description>

      <title>On the Adequacy of the Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Low Density and Dirac Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The qualitative reliability of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) is investigated for systems in which either the actual carrier density or the effective carrier density is low, by comparing the exact perturbative and dynamical mean field expressions of electron scattering rates and optical conductivities. We study two interacting systems: tight binding models in which the chemical potential is near a band edge and Dirac systems in which the chemical potential is near the Dirac point. In both systems it is found that DMFT underestimates the low frequency, near-Fermi surface single particle scattering rate by a factor proportional to the particle density. The quasiparticle effective mass is qualitatively incorrect for the low density tight binding model but not necessarily for Dirac systems. The dissipative part of the optical conductivity is more subtle: in the exact calculation vertex corrections, typically neglected in DMFT calculations, suppress the low frequency optical absorption, compensating for some of the DMFT underestimate of the scattering rate. The role of vertex corrections in calculating the conductivity for Dirac systems is clarified and a systematic discussion is given of the approach to the Galilean/Lorentz invariant low density limit. Relevance to recent calculations related to Weyl metals is discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Pair-, Charge- and Spin-Density-Wave Instabilities in Interacting D-Dimensional Fermi Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic theory unraveling the microscopic mechanism of instabilities within interacting $D$-dimensional Fermi liquid. Our model consists of a $D$-dimensional electron gas subject to an instantaneous electron-electron interaction of a finite range exceeding the average inter-particle distance. Pair, charge and spin susceptibilities are evaluated via the one-loop renormalization group theory and via the bosonization approach, giving identical results. In case of a repulsive interaction, we identify an intrinsic Fermi liquid instability towards insulating spin/charge density wave order when the interaction coupling strength reaches a universal critical value. If both electron and hole pockets of the same size are present, the ground state is an excitonic insulator at arbitrarily small repulsive interaction. If the interaction is attractive, the ground state is a singlet non-BCS superconductor with a uniform condensate. In case if both electron and hole Fermi surfaces are present, we predict an instability towards the inter-pocket pair-density-wave ordering at the critical coupling. This prediction lends strong theoretical support to the pair-density-wave scenario of superconductivity in cuprate materials. Due to its simple and universal nature, presented microscopic mechanism of intrinsic instabilities of interacting $D$-dimensional Fermi liquids constitutes a solid theoretical ground for understanding quantum phase transitions in a variety of quantum materials, from ultraclean semiconductor quantum wells to high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown in multi-orbital Anderson lattices induced by destructive hybridization interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a multi band extension to the periodic Anderson model. We use a single site DMFT(NRG) in order to study the impact of the conduction band mediated effective hopping of the correlated electrons between the correlated orbitals onto the heavy Fermi liquid formation. Whereas the hybridization of a single impurity model with two distinct conduction bands always adds up constructively, $T_{K}\propto \exp(-\mathrm{const}\, U/(\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2))$, we show that this does not have to be the case in lattice models, where, in remarkable contrast, also an low-energy Fermi liquid scale $T_0\propto \exp(-\mathrm{const}\, U/(\Gamma_1-\Gamma_2))$ can emerge due to quantum interference effects in multi band models, where $U$ denotes the local Coulomb matrix element of the correlated orbitals and $\Gamma_i$ the local hybridization strength of band $i$. At high symmetry points, heavy Fermi liquid formation is suppressed which is associated with a breakdown of the Kondo effect. This results in an asymptotically scale-invariant (i.e., power-law) spectrum of the correlated orbitals $\propto|\omega|^{1/3}$, indicating non-Fermi liquid properties of the quantum critical point, and a small Fermi surface including only the light quasi-particles. This orbital selective Mott phase demonstrates the possibility of metallic local criticality within the general framework of ordinary single site DMFT.</description>

      <title>Few-magnon excitations in a frustrated spin-$S$ ferromagnetic chain with single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study few-magnon excitations in a finite-size spin-$S$ chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $J&gt;0$ and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'&lt;0$, in the presence of the single-ion (SI) anisotropy $D$. We first reveal the condition for the emergence of zero-excitation-energy states. In the isotropic case with $\Delta=\Delta'=1$ ($\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are the corresponding anisotropy parameters), a threshold of $J/|J'|$ above which the ground state is ferromagnetic is determined by exact diagonalization for short chains up to $12$ sites. Using a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, we then map the two-magnon problem to a single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN hoppings. The whole two-magnon excitation spectrum is calculated for large systems and the commensurate-incommensurate transition in the lowest-lying mode is found to exhibit different behaviors between $S=1/2$ and higher spins due to the interplay of the SI anisotropy and the NNN interaction. For the commensurate momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective lattice is decoupled into two NN open chains that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave ansatz. Based on this, we analytically identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane the regions supporting the SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. In particular, we prove that there always exists a lower-lying NN exchange two-magnon bound state near the band edge for arbitrary $S\geq 1/2$. Finally, we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon spectra for $S=1/2$ with $n\leq5$ by using a spin-operator matrix element method. The corresponding $n$-magnon commensurate instability regions are determined for finite chains and consistent results with prior literature are observed.</description>

Abstract: Using advanced dynamical mean-field theory on a realistic level we study the normal-state correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and compare the features of the conventional bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313 electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital and multilayer interplay within a correlated flat-band scenario.</description>

Abstract: We study low-lying spin-singlet excitations of two-leg Hubbard ladders with site-dependent potentials. Using general formulas of the charge disproportionation induced by the site-dependent potentials, we derive the contributions of spin degrees of freedom to the spectral functions such as the dynamical charge structure factor $N(\boldsymbol{k},\omega)$ and the optical conductivity $\sigma_{\gamma}(\omega)$ along the $\gamma(=x,y)$-direction of the two-leg ladders. Numerical results obtained by the Lanczos diagonalization method have clarified that the multi-triplon singlet states, including two- and three-triplon excitations, can be detected by observing these quantities. Furthermore, we have found that ladders with random potentials also have non-negligible contributions of these excitations to $\sigma_x(\omega)$.</description>

Abstract: Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master Equation and the Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework. We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductors support Majorana modes, which are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and which obey non-Abelian statistics in which successive exchanges of particles do not always commute. Here we investigate whether a two-dimensional superconductor with ordinary s-wave pairing can be rendered topological by the application of a strong magnetic field. To address this, we obtain the self-consistent solutions to the mean field Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a large set of nonlinearly coupled equations, for electrons moving on a lattice. We find that the topological "quantum Hall superconductivity" is facilitated by a combination of spin-orbit coupling, which locks an electron's spin to its momentum as it moves through a material, and a coupling to an external periodic potential which gives a dispersion to the Landau levels and also distorts the Abrikosov lattice. We find that, for a range of parameters, the Landau levels broadened by the external periodic potential support topological superconductivity, which is typically accompanied by a lattice of "giant" $h/e$ vortices as opposed to the familiar lattice of $h/2e$ Abrikosov vortices. In the presence of a periodic potential, we find it necessary to use an ansatz for the pairing potential of the form $\Delta(\vec{r})e^{i2\vec{Q}\cdot\vec{r}}$ where $\Delta(\vec{r})$ has a periodicity commensurate with the periodic potential. However, despite this form of the pairing potential, the current in the ground state is zero. In the region of ordinary superconductivity, we typically find a lattice of dimers of $h/2e$ vortices. Our work suggests a realistic proposal for achieving topological superconductivity, as well as a helical order parameter and unusual Abrikosov lattices.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a layered cobalt oxychalcogenide Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O with a triangular lattice</title>

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in bulk materials under ambient pressure is extremely rare among the 3d transition metal compounds outside the layered cuprates and iron-based family. It is predominantly linked to highly anisotropic electronic properties and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surfaces. To date, the only known example of a Co-based exotic superconductor is the hydrated layered cobaltate, Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}\cdot$ yH$_{2}$O, and its superconductivity is realized in the vicinity of a spin-1/2 Mott state. However, the nature of the superconductivity in these materials is still a subject of intense debate, and therefore, finding a new class of superconductors will help unravel the mysteries of their unconventional superconductivity. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity at $\sim$ 6.3 K in our newly synthesized layered compound Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O, in which the edge-shared CoSe$_{6}$ octahedra form [CoSe$_{2}$] layers with a perfect triangular lattice of Co ions. It is the first 3d transition metal oxychalcogenide superconductor with distinct structural and chemical characteristics. Despite its relatively low $T_{c}$, this material exhibits very high superconducting upper critical fields, $\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$, which far exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor of 3 - 4. First-principles calculations show that Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O is a rare example of a negative charge transfer superconductor. This cobalt oxychalcogenide with a geometrical frustration among Co spins shows great potential as a highly appealing candidate for the realization of unconventional and/or high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity beyond the well-established Cu- and Fe-based superconductor families and opens a new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological Orders Beyond Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>

Abstract: Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interacting anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Quantum Chaos and Anomalous Relaxation in Open Quantum Circuits</title>

Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space dimension.</description>
