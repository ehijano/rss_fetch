      <title>A Control Theoretic Approach to Decentralized AI Economy Stabilization via Dynamic Buyback-and-Burn Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The democratization of artificial intelligence through decentralized networks represents a paradigm shift in computational provisioning, yet the long-term viability of these ecosystems is critically endangered by the extreme volatility of their native economic layers. Current tokenomic models, which predominantly rely on static or threshold-based buyback heuristics, are ill-equipped to handle complex system dynamics and often function pro-cyclically, exacerbating instability during market downturns. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic-Control Buyback Mechanism (DCBM), a formalized control-theoretic framework that utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with strict solvency constraints to regulate the token economy as a dynamical system. Extensive agent-based simulations utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes demonstrate that DCBM fundamentally outperforms static baselines, reducing token price volatility by approximately 66% and lowering operator churn from 19.5% to 8.1% in high-volatility regimes. These findings establish that converting tokenomics from static rules into continuous, structurally constrained control loops is a necessary condition for secure and sustainable decentralized intelligence networks.</description>

      <title>Inverse Learning in $2\times2$ Games: From Synthetic Interactions to Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how agents coordinate or compete from limited behavioral data is central to modeling strategic interactions in traffic, robotics, and other multi-agent systems. In this work, we investigate the following complementary formulations of inverse game-theoretic learning: (i) a Closed-form Correlated Equilibrium Maximum-Likelihood estimator (CE-ML) specialized for $2\times2$ games; and (ii) a Logit Best Response Maximum-Likelihood estimator (LBR-ML) that captures long-run adaptation dynamics via stochastic response processes. Together, these approaches span the spectrum between static equilibrium consistency and dynamic behavioral realism. We evaluate them on synthetic "chicken-dare" games and traffic-interaction scenarios simulated in SUMO, comparing parameter recovery and distributional fit. Results reveal clear trade-offs between interpretability, computational tractability, and behavioral expressiveness across models.</description>

      <title>Modeling conflicting incentives in engineering senior capstone projects: A multi-player game theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: University engineering capstone projects involve sustained interaction among students, faculty, and industry sponsors whose objectives are only partially aligned. While capstones are widely used in engineering education, existing analyses typically treat stakeholder behavior informally or descriptively, leaving incentive conflicts, information asymmetries, and strategic dependencies underexplored. This paper develops a formal game-theoretic framework that models capstone projects as a sequential Bayesian game involving three players: the university, the industry sponsor, and the student team. The framework is intended as an analytical and explanatory tool for understanding how institutional policy choices, such as grading structures, intellectual property rules, and sponsor engagement expectations, shape stakeholder behavior and project outcomes, rather than as a calibrated or predictive model. The university acts as a constrained Stackelberg leader by committing to course policies and assessment structures while anticipating strategic responses by sponsors and students under incomplete information. Reduced-form outcome functions capture technical quality, documentation quality, timeliness, alignment with sponsor needs, and publishability, while payoff functions reflect stakeholder-specific objectives and costs. Under standard assumptions, the model admits stable equilibrium regimes that correspond to empirically recognizable capstone dynamics observed in practice, including cooperative engagement, sponsor-dominated exploitation, and student grade gaming. Rather than claiming precise prediction, the framework provides a structured basis for reasoning about incentive design, policy tradeoffs, and structural failure modes in project-based learning environments, as well as for future extensions incorporating richer dynamics, repeated interaction, and empirical calibration.</description>

      <title>SuS: Strategy-aware Surprise for Intrinsic Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive involvement and resolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding a single voter). In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>Procedural Fairness in Multi-Agent Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), fairness is often reduced to outcomes: maximizing welfare, reducing inequality, or balancing utilities. However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.</description>

      <title>A vector bundle approach to Nash equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use vector bundles to study the locus of totally mixed Nash equilibria of an $n$-player game in normal form, which we call the Nash equilibrium scheme. When the payoff tensor format is balanced, we study the Nash discriminant variety, i.e., the algebraic variety of games whose Nash equilibrium scheme is nonreduced or has a positive dimensional component. We prove that this variety has codimension one. We classify all possible components of the Nash equilibrium scheme for a binary three-player game. We prove that if the payoff tensor is of boundary format, then the Nash discriminant variety has two components: an irreducible hypersurface and a larger-codimensional component. A generic game with an unbalanced payoff tensor format does not admit totally mixed Nash equilibria. We define the Nash resultant variety of games admitting a positive number of totally mixed Nash equilibria. We prove that it is irreducible and determine its codimension and degree.</description>

      <title>Classification in Equilibrium: Structure of Optimal Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes optimal classification when individuals adjust their behavior in response to the classification rule. We model the interaction between a designer and a population as a Stackelberg game: the designer selects a classification rule anticipating how individuals will comply, cheat, or abstain in order to obtain a favorable classification. Under standard monotone likelihood ratio assumptions, and for a general set of classification objectives, optimal rules belong to a small and interpretable family--single-threshold and two-cut rules--that encompass both conventional and counterintuitive designs. Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals. In equilibrium, global accuracy can be maximized by rewarding those with lower likelihood ratios or by concentrating rewards or penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality. We further characterize classification objectives that rule out socially harmful equilibria that disincentivize compliance for some populations.</description>

      <title>When Should a Principal Delegate to an Agent in Selection Processes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-makers in high-stakes selection processes often face a fundamental choice: whether to make decisions themselves or to delegate authority to another entity whose incentives may only be partially aligned with their own. Such delegation arises naturally in settings like graduate admissions, hiring, or promotion, where a principal (e.g. a professor or worker) either reviews applicants personally or decisions are delegated to an agent (e.g. a committee or boss) that evaluates applicants efficiently, but according to a potentially misaligned objective.
  We study this trade-off in a stylized selection model with noisy signals. The principal incurs a cost for selecting applicants, but can evaluate applicants based on their fit with a project, team, workplace, etc. In contrast, the agent evaluates applicants solely on the basis of a signal that correlates with the principal's metric, but this comes at no cost to the principal. Our goal is to characterize when delegation is beneficial versus when decision-making should remain with the principal. We compare these regimes along three dimensions: (i) the principal's utility, (ii) the quality of the selected applicants according to the principal's metric, and (iii) the fairness of selection outcomes under disparate signal qualities.</description>
