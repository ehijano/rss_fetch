      <title>VPV Identities related to $\mathbf{x^y = y^x}$ and $\mathbf{x^y y^x = v^w w^v}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cover rational and integer solutions for the equations $\mathbf{x^y = y^x}$ and $\mathbf{x^y y^x = v^w w^v}$. The former equation solutions go back to Euler, and the latter equation solutions appear to be new. Another definitely new related topic is application of VPV identities to give transforms of infinite products from our solutions. The present paper is essentially chapter 28 of the author's book appearing in June 2024.</description>

      <title>Binary forms with the same value set I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a binary form $F \in \mathbb{Z}[X, Y]$, we define its value set to be $\{F(x, y) : (x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2\}$. Let $F, G \in \mathbb{Z}[X, Y]$ be two binary forms of degree $d \geq 3$ and with non-zero discriminant. In a series of three papers, we will give necessary and sufficient conditions on $F$ and $G$ to have the same value set. These conditions will be entirely in terms of the automorphism groups of the forms.
  In this paper, we will build the general theory that reduces the problem to a question about lattice coverings of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and we solve this problem when $F$ and $G$ have a small automorphism group. The larger automorphism groups $D_4$ and $D_3, D_6$ will respectively be treated in part II and part III.</description>

      <title>A note on weighted consecutive Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $A\subseteq [1,\exp(G)-1]$. We define the constant ${\sf C}_A(G),$ which is the least positive integer $\ell$ such that every sequence over $G$ of length at least $\ell$ has an $A$-weighted consecutive product-one subsequence. In this paper, among other things, we prove that ${\sf C}_A(C_n^2)=4$ with $A=[1,n-1],$ and ${\sf C}(H\times K)=|H||K|$, where $H$ is a finite abelian group and $K$ is a metacyclic group.</description>

      <title>On some determinants arising from quadratic residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime, and let $d\in\mathbb Z$ with $p\nmid d$. For the determinants $$S_m(d,p)=\det\left[(i^2+dj^2)^{m}\right]_{1\leqslant i,j \leqslant (p-1)/2}\ \ \left(\frac{p-1}2\leqslant m\leqslant p-1\right),$$ Sun recently determined $S_m(d,p)$ modulo $p$ when $m\in\{p-2,p-3\}$ and $(\frac {-d}p)=-1$. In this paper, we obtain $S_{p-2}(d,p)$ modulo $p$ in the remaining case $(\frac{-d}p)=1$, and determine the Legendre symbols $(\frac{S_{p-3}\,(d,p)}p)$ and $(\frac{S_{p-4}\,(d,p)}p)$ in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Modular resurgent structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of resurgence uniquely associates a factorially divergent formal power series with a collection of non-perturbative, exponential-type corrections paired with a set of complex numbers, known as Stokes constants. When the Borel plane displays a single infinite tower of singularities, the secondary resurgent series are trivial, and the Stokes constants are coefficients of an $L$-function, a rich analytic number-theoretic fabric underlies the resurgent structure of the asymptotic series. We propose a new paradigm of modular resurgence that focuses on the role of the Stokes constants and the interplay of the $q$-series acting as their generating functions with the corresponding $L$-functions. Guided by two pivotal examples arising from topological string theory and the theory of Maass cusp forms, we introduce the notion of modular resurgent series, which we conjecture to have specific summability properties as well as to be closely related to quantum modular forms.</description>

      <title>Bogomolov property for certain infinite non-Galois extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an algebraic number $\alpha$, let $h(\alpha)$ denote its logarithmic Weil height. In 2002, Bombieri and Zannier obtained lower bounds for Weil height for totally $p$-adic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., infinite Galois extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ with finite local degree over a rational prime $p$. In this paper, we formulate and prove the non-Galois analogue of this result. In particular, if a positive proportion of conjugates of $\alpha\in\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ lie in a finite local extension $K_{\nu}/\mathbb{Q}_p$, then we obtain a lower bound for $h(\alpha)$. We also discuss the lower bound for canonical height of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ in such infinite extensions.</description>

      <title>Applications of multiple orthogonal polynomials with hypergeometric moment generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08312v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate several families of multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with weights for which the moment generating functions are hypergeometric series with slightly varying parameters. The weights are supported on the unit interval, the positive real line, or the unit circle and the multiple orthogonal polynomials are generalizations of the Jacobi, Laguerre or Bessel orthogonal polynomials. We give explicit formulas for the type I and type II multiple orthogonal polynomials and study some of their properties. In particular, we describe the asymptotic distribution of the (scaled) zeros of the type II multiple orthogonal polynomials via the free convolution. Essential to our overall approach is the use of the Mellin transform. Finally, we discuss two applications. First, we show that the multiple orthogonal polynomials appear naturally in the study of the squared singular values of (mixed) products of truncated unitary random matrices and Ginibre matrices. Secondly, we use the multiple orthogonal polynomials to simultaneously approximate certain hypergeometric series and to provide an explicit proof of their $\mathbb{Q}$-linear independence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the space of rational curves on smooth complete intersections of low degree, which pass through a given set of points on the variety. The argument uses spreading out to a finite field, together with an adaptation to function fields of positive characteristic of work by Rydin Myerson on the circle method. Our work also allows us to handle weak approximation for such varieties.</description>

      <title>On the number of subsequence sums of a sequence in finite abelian groups related to the support of the sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $S$ a sequence with elements of $G$. Let $|S|$ denote the length of $S$ and $k$ an integer with $k\in [1, |S|]$. Let $\Sigma_{k}(S) \subset G$ denote the set of group elements which can be expressed as a sum of a subsequence of $S$ with length $k$. Let $\Sigma(S)=\cup_{k=1}^{|S|}\Sigma_{k}(S)$ and $\Sigma_{\geq k}(S)=\cup_{t=k}^{|S|}\Sigma_{t}(S)$. It is known that if $0\not\in \Sigma(S)$, then $|\Sigma(S)|\geq |S|+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|-1$, where $|\mathrm{supp}(S)|$ denotes the number of distinct terms in $S$. In this paper, we study the above inequality. On one hand, we determine the sequence $S$ with $0\notin \Sigma(S)$ such that $|\Sigma(S)|= |S|+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|-1$. As a corollary, we disprove a conjecture of Gao, Grynkiewicz, and Xia. On the other hand, we generate the above inequality as if $|S|&gt;k$ and $0\not\in \Sigma_{\geq k}(S)\cup \Sigma_{1}(S)$, then $|\Sigma_{\geq k}(S)|\geq |S|-k+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|$. Then among other results, we give an alternative proof of a conjecture of Hamidoune, which was first proved by Gao, Grynkiewicz, and Xia.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Zilber--Pink conjecture for curves in $Y(1)^n$ whose Zariski closure in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^n$ passes through the point $(\infty, \ldots, \infty)$, going beyond the asymmetry condition of Habegger and Pila. Our proof is based on a height bound following Andr\'e's G-functions method. The principal novelty is that we exploit relations between evaluations of G-functions at unboundedly many non-archimedean places.</description>

      <title>Density of Rational Points Near Flat/Rough Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $n\geq 3$, let $\mathscr{M} \subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a compact hypersurface, parametrized by a homogeneous function of degree $d\in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;1}$, with non-vanishing curvature away from the origin. Consider the number $\mathrm{N}_{\mathscr{M}}(\delta,Q)$ of rationals $\mathbf{a}/q$, with denominator $q\in [Q,2Q)$ and $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{Z}^{n-1}$, lying at a distance at most $\delta/q$ from $\mathscr{M}$. This manuscript provides essentially sharp estimates for $\mathrm{N}_{\mathscr{M}}(\delta,Q)$ throughout the range $\delta \in (Q^{\varepsilon-1},1/2)$ for $d&gt;1+\tfrac{1}{2n-3}$. Our result is a first of its kind for hypersurfaces with vanishing Gaussian curvature ($d&gt;2$) and those which are rough (meaning not even $C^2$ at the origin which happens when $d&lt;2$). An interesting outcome of our investigation is the understanding of a `geometric' term $(\delta/Q)^{(n-1)/d}Q^n$ (stemming from a so-called Knapp cap), arising in addition to the usual probabilistic term $\delta Q^n$; the sum of these terms determines the size of $\mathrm{N}_{\mathscr{M}}(\delta,Q)$ for $\delta\in(Q^{\varepsilon-1},1/2)$. Consequences of our result concern the metric theory of Diophantine approximation on `rough' hypersurfaces -- going beyond the recent break-through of Beresnevich and L. Yang. Further, we establish smooth extensions of Serre's dimension growth conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Survey of a Random Matrix Model for a Family of Cusp Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Katz-Sarnak philosophy states that statistics of zeros of $L$-function families near the central point as the conductors tend to infinity agree with those of eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles as the matrix size tends to infinity. While numerous results support this conjecture, S. J. Miller observed that for finite conductors, very different behavior can occur for zeros near the central point in elliptic curve families. This led to the excised model of Due\~{n}ez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and Snaith, whose predictions for quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve are beautifully fit by the data. The key ingredients are relating the discretization of central values of the $L$-functions to excising matrices based on the value of the characteristic polynomials at 1 and using lower order terms (in statistics such as the one-level density and pair-correlation) to adjust the matrix size. We discuss recent successes by the authors in extending this model to a family of quadratic twists of finite conductor of a given holomorphic cuspidal newform of level an odd prime level. In particular, we predict very little repulsion for forms with weight greater than 2.</description>

      <title>On smooth gaps between primes using the Maynard-Tao sieve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1999, Balog, Br\"udern, and Wooley (1999) showed there are infinitely many prime gaps $p-q$ that are $(\log p)^{\frac{3}{4}}$-smooth, and infinitely many consecutive prime gaps that are $(\log p)^\frac{7}{8}$-smooth. Advancements made since then by Zhang (2014), Maynard (2014), and Polymath8b (2014) towards resolving the twin prime conjecture have given us the tools to lower the bounds made by Balog, Br\"udern, and Wooley to 47. Moreover, we can show there are infinitely many $m$-tuples of primes whose gaps are all $y_m$-smooth for a calculable prime $y_m$.</description>
