      <title>Expanding Density-Correlation Machine Learning Representations for Anisotropic Coarse-Grained Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based, atom-centered machine learning (ML) representations have been instrumental to the effective integration of ML within the atomistic simulation community. Many of these representations build off the idea of atoms as having spherical, or isotropic, interactions. In many communities, there is often a need to represent groups of atoms, either to increase the computational efficiency of simulation via coarse-graining or to understand molecular influences on system behavior. In such cases, atom-centered representations will have limited utility, as groups of atoms may not be well-approximated as spheres. In this work, we extend the popular Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) ML representation for systems consisting of non-spherical anisotropic particles or clusters of atoms. We show the power of this anisotropic extension of SOAP, which we deem \AniSOAP, in accurately characterizing liquid crystal systems and predicting the energetics of Gay-Berne ellipsoids and coarse-grained benzene crystals. With our study of these prototypical anisotropic systems, we derive fundamental insights into how molecular shape influences mesoscale behavior and explain how to reincorporate important atom-atom interactions typically not captured by coarse-grained models. Moving forward, we propose \AniSOAP as a flexible, unified framework for coarse-graining in complex, multiscale simulation.</description>

      <title>Convolutional network learning of self-consistent electron density via grid-projected atomic fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-consistent field (SCF) generation of the three-dimensional (3D) electron density distribution ($\rho$) represents a fundamental aspect of density functional theory (DFT) and related first-principles calculations, and how one can shorten or bypass the SCF loop represents a critical question from both practical and fundamental standpoints. Herein, a machine learning strategy DeepSCF is presented in which the map between the SCF $\rho$ and the initial guess density ($\rho_0$) constructed by the summation of neutral atomic densities is learned using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). High accuracy and transferability of DeepSCF are achieved by expanding the input features to include atomic fingerprints beyond $\rho_0$ and encoding them on a 3D grid. The prediction of the residual density ($\delta\rho$) rather than $\rho$ itself is targeted, and, since $\delta\rho$ corresponds to chemical bonding information, a dataset of small-sized organic molecules featuring diverse bonding characters is adopted. After enhancing the fidelity of the method by subjecting the atomic geometries in the dataset to random strains and rotations, the effectiveness of DeepSCF is finally demonstrated using a complex large carbon nanotube-based DNA sequencer model. This work evidences that the nearsightedness in electronic structures can be optimally represented via the local connectivity in CNNs.</description>

      <title>twoPhaseInterTrackFoam: an OpenFOAM module for Arbitrary Lagrangian/Eulerian Interface Tracking with Surfactants and Subgrid-Scale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an implementation of the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking method for simulating incompressible, immiscible two-phase flows as an OpenFOAM module. In addition to interface-tracking capabilities that include tracking of two fluid phases, an implementation of a Subgrid-Scale (SGS) modeling framework for increased accuracy when simulating sharp boundary layers is enclosed. The SGS modeling framework simplifies embedding subgrid-scale profiles into the unstructured Finite Volume discretization. Our design of the SGS model library significantly simplifies adding new SGS models and applying SGS modeling to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in OpenFOAM.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams as Computational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational graph representation of high-order Feynman diagrams in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), applicable to any combination of spatial, temporal, momentum, and frequency domains. Utilizing the Dyson-Schwinger and parquet equations, our approach effectively organizes these diagrams into a fractal structure of tensor operations, significantly reducing computational redundancy. This approach not only streamlines the evaluation of complex diagrams but also facilitates an efficient implementation of the field-theoretic renormalization scheme, crucial for enhancing perturbative QFT calculations. Key to this advancement is the integration of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation, a key technique employed in machine learning packages to compute higher-order derivatives efficiently on computational graphs. To operationalize these concepts, we develop a Feynman diagram compiler that optimizes diagrams for various computational platforms, utilizing machine learning frameworks. Demonstrating this methodology's effectiveness, we apply it to the three-dimensional uniform electron gas problem, achieving unprecedented accuracy in calculating the quasiparticle effective mass at metal density. Our work demonstrates the synergy between QFT and machine learning, establishing a new avenue for applying AI techniques to complex quantum many-body problems.</description>

      <title>pyMSER -- An open-source library for automatic equilibration detection in molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated molecular simulations are used extensively for predicting material properties. Typically, these simulations exhibit two regimes: a dynamic equilibration part, followed by a steady state. For extracting observable properties, the simulations must first reach a steady state so that thermodynamic averages can be taken. However, as equilibration depends on simulation conditions, predicting the optimal number of simulation steps a priori is impossible. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Marginal Standard Error Rule (MSER) for automatically identifying the optimal truncation point in Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. This novel automatic procedure determines the point in which steady state is reached, ensuring that figures-of-merits are extracted in an objective, accurate, and reproducible fashion. In the case of GCMC simulations of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, we find that this methodology reduces the computational cost by up to 90%. As MSER statistics are independent of the simulation method that creates the data, this library is, in principle, applicable to any time series analysis in which equilibration truncation is required. The open-source Python implementation of our method, pyMSER, is publicly available for reuse and validation at https://github.com/IBM/pymser.</description>

      <title>Efficient rational approximation of optical response functions with the AAA algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework for the rational approximation of optical response functions in resonant photonic systems. The framework is based on the AAA algorithm and further allows to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenproblems and to efficiently model sensitivities. An adaptive sampling strategy exploits the predominance of resonances in the physical response. We investigate a chiral metasurface and show that the chiroptical response on parameter variations can be accurately modeled in the vicinity of the relevant resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>RASCBEC: RAman Spectroscopy Calculation via Born Effective Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the algorithm for ab initio calculations of Raman spectra for large systems via applying external electric field, and complement it by a code implementation we name RASCBEC. With the RASCBEC code, we have successfully benchmark crystalline materials and compute Raman spectra of large molecules, and amorphous oxides. Our results demonstrate a remarkable level of agreement with the results from other commonly used codes as well as the experimental data. The electric field approach for Raman spectra calculation is designed to overcome the computational challenges associated with the conventional approach, which requires the calculation of the macroscopic dielectric tensor at numerous molecular geometries. The key innovation in our approach lies in obtaining the first-order derivatives with respect to the external electric field directly from VASP (the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package), as the Born Effective Charge (BEC). The RASCBEC code not only significantly reduces computational time, up to a factor of $N/8$, compared to the conventional approach, where $N$ is the total count of atoms within the simulation box. But also maintains the same level of accuracy, employing first-order numerical derivatives that avoid the numerical noise associated with algorithms requiring second-order derivatives, as seen in other electric field-based methods. This advantage makes RASCBEC particularly beneficial for large molecules and expansive amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensional homogeneity constrained gene expression programming for discovering governing equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations is of great significance for helping us understand intrinsic mechanisms and build physical models. Recently, numerous highly innovative algorithms have emerged, aimed at inversely discovering the underlying governing equations from data, such as sparse regression-based methods and symbolic regression-based methods. Along this direction, a novel dimensional homogeneity constrained gene expression programming (DHC-GEP) method is proposed in this work. DHC-GEP simultaneously discovers the forms and coefficients of functions using basic mathematical operators and physical variables, without requiring pre-assumed candidate functions. The constraint of dimensional homogeneity is capable of filtering out the overfitting equations effectively. The key advantages of DHC-GEP compared to Original-GEP, including being more robust to hyperparameters, the noise level and the size of datasets, are demonstrated on two benchmark studies. Furthermore, DHC-GEP is employed to discover the unknown constitutive relations of two representative non-equilibrium flows. Galilean invariance and the second law of thermodynamics are imposed as constraints to enhance the reliability of the discovered constitutive relations. Comparisons, both quantitative and qualitative, indicate that the derived constitutive relations are more accurate than the conventional Burnett equations in a wide range of Knudsen number and Mach number, and are also applicable to the cases beyond the parameter space of the training data.</description>

      <title>Tensorial properties via the neuroevolution potential framework: Fast simulation of infrared and Raman spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared and Raman spectroscopy are widely used for the characterization of gases, liquids, and solids, as the spectra contain a wealth of information concerning in particular the dynamics of these systems. Atomic scale simulations can be used to predict such spectra but are often severely limited due to high computational cost or the need for strong approximations that limit application range and reliability. Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML) accelerated approach that addresses these shortcomings and provides a significant performance boost in terms of data and computational efficiency compared to earlier ML schemes. To this end, we generalize the neuroevolution potential approach to enable the prediction of rank one and two tensors to obtain the tensorial neuroevolution potential (TNEP) scheme. We apply the resulting framework to construct models for the dipole moment, polarizability, and susceptibility of molecules, liquids, and solids, and show that our approach compares favorably with several ML models from the literature with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the TNEP approach to the prediction of infrared and Raman spectra of liquid water, a molecule (PTAF-), and a prototypical perovskite with strong anharmonicity (BaZrO3). The TNEP approach is implemented in the free and open source software package GPUMD, which makes this methodology readily available to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Quantized plastic deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In engineering crystal plasticity inelastic mechanisms correspond to tensorial zero-energy valleys in the space of macroscopic strains. The flat nature of such valleys is in contradiction with the fact that plastic slips, mimicking lattice-invariant shears, are inherently discrete. A reconciliation has recently been achieved in the mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal plasticity, which introduces periodically modulated energy valleys while also capturing in a geometrically exact way the crystallographically-specific aspects of plastic slips. In this paper, we extend the MTM framework, which in its original form had the appearance of a discretized nonlinear elasticity theory, by explicitly introducing the concept of plastic deformation. The ensuing model contains a novel matrix-valued spin variable, representing the quantized plastic distortion, whose rate-independent evolution can be described by a discrete (quasi-)automaton. The proposed reformulation of the MTM leads to a considerable computational speedup associated with the use of a robust and efficient hybrid Gauss-Newton--Cauchy energy minimization algorithm. To illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach, we present a detailed case-study focusing on the aspects of crystal plasticity that are beyond reach for the classical continuum theory. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that the re-formulated MTM is fully adequate to deal with the intermittency of plastic response under quasi-static loading. In particular, our numerical experiments show that the statistics of dislocational avalanches, associated with plastic yield in 2D square crystals, exhibits a power-law tail with a critical exponent matching the value predicted by general theoretical considerations and also independently observed in discrete-dislocation-dynamics (DDD) simulations.</description>
