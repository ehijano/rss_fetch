      <title>Thermodynamic Diagnostics for Complex Langevin Simulations: The Role of Configurational Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) is a promising approach to tackle the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, thus underscoring the need for robust diagnostics. Existing criteria, such as monitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable, but they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability test based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the estimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use one-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the estimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method is readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where scalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results suggest that configurational temperature can be integrated into a hybrid diagnostic framework, thus enhancing the robustness of CLM across a wide range of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite density.</description>

      <title>GUMP1.0 -- First global extraction of generalized parton distributions from experiment and lattice data with NLO accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first global extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), GUMP1.0, by combining deeply virtual Compton scattering and $\rho$-meson production data from Jefferson Lab and Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator with global fits of parton distribution functions, charge form factors, and lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations. Using a conformal moment space parametrization, we achieve a unified description across low- and high-$x$ regions at next to leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative corrections. The results provide state-of-the-art GPDs consistent with almost all known facts, enabling three-dimensional nucleon imaging in impact parameter space and, at the same time, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of the nucleon structure.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretic versus data-driven evaluations of electromagnetic corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization in $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model prediction of the muon $g-2$ increasingly depends on lattice QCD computations of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP), where the isospin-breaking (IB) effects remain a significant source of uncertainty. To complement the lattice QCD evaluations, the data-driven approach to HVP has been used to assess some of the electromagnetic IB effects, in particular from the channels with a photon in the final state, e.g., $e^+e^-\to\pi^0 \gamma$. Here we argue that such contributions are largely canceled by virtual electromagnetic corrections to the purely hadronic channels: $\pi^+ \pi^-$, $\pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$, etc. We identify these leading corrections by performing a field-theoretical calculation in a vector-meson dominance model, thereby reconciling the timelike and spacelike approaches to electromagnetic effects. Although these virtual corrections are more difficult to extract in a systematic manner, addressing them is essential for the data-driven method to consistently complement the lattice QCD program.</description>

      <title>$T \times \mu$ phase diagram from a fractal NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a $\mu$-dependent coupling for a fractal effective model (FNJL) to make the results for the phase diagram compatible with the experimental data and lattice QCD calculations. The $\mu$-dependence of the coupling, which accounts for gluon effects, is obtained by fitting the lattice QCD results for the pseudo-critical temperature with the fractal model. We then use the new effective coupling in order to compute the dynamical mass, the quark condensate, the thermal susceptibility and, finally, the $T\times\mu$ phase diagram. We consider both extensive and non-extensive statistics, and with a slight variation in the $\mu$-dependent coupling parameters we provide a single result for our model which is able to describe incredibly well the data from STAR, considering the simplicity of the effective model.</description>

      <title>Approximation in Lattice Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ homogeneous electron fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy is into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model - a small square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions - are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 10^3$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the Sn isotopes near the proton dripline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first $\textit{ab initio}$ lattice calculations of the proton-rich tin isotopes $^{99}$Sn to $^{102}$Sn using nuclear lattice effective field theory with high-fidelity two- and three-nucleon forces. For a given set of three-nucleon couplings, we reproduce binding energies with $\sim 1\%$ accuracy for the even-even systems, and obtain energy splitting and two-nucleon separation energies in agreement with experiment. Our results confirm the $N=50$ shell closure and reveal that the binding energy of $^{99}$Sn lies below values extrapolated from heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <title>BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by $(18.2 \pm 0.5)\%$ and $(52.8 \pm 6.3)\%$ for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>
