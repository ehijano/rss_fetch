      <description>arXiv:2510.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some new sharp constructions for the Szemer\'{e}di-Trotter theorem. These constructions generalize previous work of Erd\H{o}s, Elekes, Sheffer and Silier, Guth and Silier, and the author. In the past, arguments showing the optimality of many of these constructions have required some elementary number theory and have been rather technical, thus limiting the scope of the results. We replace these number-theoretic arguments with purely incidence-geometric ones, allowing for simpler proofs and more general results.</description>

      <title>On recent Partition function of Kaur and Rana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kaur and Rana introduced the partition function denoted by $\rho(n)$, where the largest part $\lambda$ appears exactly once, and the remaining parts constitute a partition of $\lambda$. In this paper, we establish new generating functions for certain variants of $\rho(n)$. Further, we obtain a linear recurrence relation for our new generating function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov's equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz is a widely studied topic in number theory, and the structure of its solutions has profound connections with mathematical fields such as combinatorics, hyperbolic geometry, approximation theory, and cluster algebras. In this paper, we prove that Markov's equation is not partition regular, which also confirms a necessary condition for the Uniqueness Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-representation for Tait coloring and sums over spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a connected pseudograph $H$ such that each edge is associated with weight $x_e$, $x_e \in \mathbb{F}_3$; $\mathcal{T}(H)$ is the set of spanning trees of graph $H$. Assume that $s(H;{\mathbf x})=\sum_{T\in\mathcal{T}(H)} \prod_{e\in E(T)} x_e$. Let $G$ be a maximal planar graph (arbitrary planar triangulation) such that each face $F$ is assigned the value $\alpha(F)=\pm 1 \in \mathbb{F}_3$. Then we can associate each edge with $x_e=\alpha(F'_e)+\alpha(F''_e)$, where $F'_e$ and $F''_e$ are the faces containing edge $e$. Let us define the value $w_G({\mathbf x})$ as $\left(\frac{s(G/W^*({\mathbf x});{\mathbf x})}3\right)/(-3)^{\left(|V(G/W^*({\mathbf x}))| - 1\right)/2}$; here $\left(\frac{x}3\right)$ is the Legendre symbol, $G/W$ is the graph with the contracted set of vertices $W$, while $W^*({\mathbf x})$ is a set of vertices $W$, $W \subseteq V(G)$, with minimal cardinality such that $s(G/W;{\mathbf x})$ differs from zero. In the following, we prove that the number of Tait colorings for graph $G$ equals the tripled sum $w_G({\mathbf x}(\alpha))$ with respect to all possible vectors $\alpha \in \{-1, 1\}^{\mathcal F(G)}$ such that $G/W^*({\mathbf x}(\alpha))$ has an odd number of vertices, where $\mathcal F(G)$ is the set of faces of graph $G$. Keywords: maximal planar graph, Tait coloring, Laplace-Kirchhoff matrix, spanning tree.</description>

      <title>Distance mutual-visibility coloring: relations with (total) domination, exact distance graphs and graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of mutual-visibility (MV) has been extended in several directions. A vertex subset $S$ of a graph $G$ is a $k$-distance mutual-visibility ($k$DMV) set if for any two vertices in $S$, there is a geodesic between them of length at most $k$ whose internal vertices are not in $S$. In this paper, we combine this with the MV coloring as follows. For any integer $k\geq1$, a $k$DMV coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$DMV sets, and the $k$DMV chromatic number $\chi_{\mu_k}(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of such a partition. When $k=1$ or $k\ge {\rm diam}(G)$, it equals the clique cover number $\theta(G)$ or the MV chromatic number $\chi_{\mu}(G)$, respectively. So, our attention is given to $1&lt;k&lt;{\rm diam}(G)$ with $k=2$ producing the most interesting results. We prove that $\chi_{\mu_2}(G)\le|V(G)|/2$ and present large families of graphs that attain the bound. In addition, $\chi_{\mu_2}(G)$ is bounded from above by the total domination number $\gamma_t(G)$ if $G$ is isolate-free, while in graphs $G$ with girth $g(G)\geq7$, $\chi_{\mu_2}(G)$ is bounded from below by the domination number $\gamma(G)$. A surprising relation with the exact distance-2 graphs is found, which results in $\theta(G^{[\natural2]})=\gamma_{t}(G)$ for any isolate-free graph $G$ with $g(G)\geq7$. The relation is explored further in lexicographic product graphs, where we prove the sharp inequalities $\chi_{\mu_{2}}(G\circ H)\leq \theta(G^{[\natural2]})\leq \theta\big{(}(G\circ H)^{[\natural2]}\big{)}$. We also prove a sharp lower (resp. upper) bound on $\chi_{\mu_2}$ (resp. $\chi_{\mu_k}$) for the Cartesian (resp. strong) product of two connected graphs and show that they are widely sharp. Finally, we characterize the block graphs $G$ with $\chi_{\mu_k}(G)=\chi_{\mu}(G)$, where $k={\rm diam}(G)-1$.</description>

      <title>Graph Powers of Groups II: The RA Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $\Gamma$ and group $G$, $G^\Gamma$ is the subgroup of $G^{|\Gamma|}$ generated by elements with $g$ in the coordinates corresponding to $v$ and its neighbors in $\Gamma$. There is a natural epimorphism $G^\Gamma \to (G/[G,G])^\Gamma$ with kernel $[G,G]^n \cap G^\Gamma$. When $[G,G]^n \leq G^\Gamma$, the structure of $G^\Gamma$ is easily described from $(G/[G,G])^\Gamma$. Fixing $\Gamma$, if $[G,G]^{|\Gamma|} \leq G^\Gamma$ for all $G$, we say that $\Gamma$ is RA (reducible to abelian). We showed in [2] that wide classes of graphs are RA, including graphs of girth 5 or more. The key tool is the RA matrix $C_{\Gamma}$, and we showed that $\Gamma$ is RA if and only if the row space $Row(C_\Gamma) = \mathbb Z^{|\Gamma|}$.
  Here, we study the possibilities for the elementary divisors of $C_\Gamma$; the more nontrivial elementary divisors we get, the further $\Gamma$ is from being RA (and the harder $G^\Gamma$ is to describe). We show that while many graphs, including those of girth 4, cartesian products, and most tensor products have at most one nontrivial elementary divisor, one can construct a graph of girth 3 with any prescribed set of elementary divisors and $\mathbb Z$-nullity.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Polysymmetric Functions and Stack Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polysymmetric functions, introduced by Asvin G. and Andrew O'Desky, provide a new framework linking combinatorics and algebraic geometry through motivic measures in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. Building on this foundation and the combinatorial results of Khanna and Loehr, we study the non-tensor bases of the polysymmetric algebra, introducing a new basis $\{H^+_{\tau}\}$ and deriving explicit expansions among the families $\{H_{\tau}\}$, $\{E_{\tau}\}$, $\{E^+_{\tau}\}$, $\{P_{\tau}\}$, and $\{H^+_{\tau}\}$, where each basis is indexed by stack partitions (types) that generalize integer partitions by recording both degrees and multiplicities. Using the Pieri-type rule established by Khanna and Loehr for related families, we extend it to the $H^+$ basis, give a combinatorial description of the product of monomial polysymmetric functions, and identify an involution for the $P$ basis.</description>

      <title>Some results on minimum saturated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. We say a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{F}$-saturated if $G$ does not contain any member in $\mathcal{F}$ and for any $e\in E(\overline{G})$, $G+e$ creates a copy of some member in $ \mathcal{F}$. The saturation number of $\mathcal{F}$ is the minimum number of edges of an $\mathcal{F}$-saturated graphs with $n$ vertices, denoted by $\sat(n,\mathcal{F})$. If $\mathcal{F}=\{F\}$, then we write it as $\sat(n,F)$ for short. In this paper, we determine the exact value of $\sat(n,\{K_3,P_k\})$, and as its application, we obtain two bounds of $\sat(n,K_3\cup P_k)$ for $k\ge 10$ and sufficiently large $n$. Furthermore, $\sat(n,K_1\lor F)$ is determined, where $F$ is a linear forest without isolated vertices.</description>

      <title>Generalized toughness and Q-index in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. We denote by $c(G)$, $\alpha(G)$ and $q(G)$ the number of components, the independence number and the signless Laplacian spectral radius ($Q$-index for short) of $G$, respectively. The toughness of $G$ is defined by $t(G)=\min\left\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}:S\subseteq V(G), c(G-S)\geq2\right\}$ for $G\neq K_n$ and $t(G)=+\infty$ for $G=K_n$. Chen, Gu and Lin [Generalized toughness and spectral radius of graphs, Discrete Math. 349 (2026) 114776] generalized this notion and defined the $l$-toughness $t_l(G)$ of a graph $G$ as $t_l(G)=\min\left\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}:S\subset V(G), c(G-S)\geq l\right\}$ if $2\leq l\leq\alpha(G)$, and $t_l(G)=+\infty$ if $l&gt;\alpha(G)$. If $t_l(G)\geq t$, then $G$ is said to be $(t,l)$-tough. In this paper, we put forward $Q$-index conditions for a graph to be $(b,l)$-tough and $(\frac{1}{b},l)$-tough, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for even factors in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. We denote by $e(G)$ and $\rho(G)$ the size and the spectral radius of $G$. A spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ is called an even factor of $G$ if $d_F(v)\in\{2,4,6,\ldots\}$ for every $v\in V(G)$. Yan and Kano provided a sufficient condition using the number of odd components in $G-S$ for a graph $G$ of even order to contain an even factor, where $S$ is a vertex subset of $G$ [Z. Yan, M. Kano, Strong Tutte type conditions and factors of graphs, Discuss. Math. Graph Theory 40 (2020) 1057--1065]. In this paper, motivated by Yan and Kano's above result, we present some tight sufficient conditions to guarantee that a connected graph $G$ with the minimum degree $\delta$ contains an even factor with respect to its size and spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Odd hypergraph Mantel theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Sidorenko (1989) shows that the Tur\'{a}n density of every $r$-uniform hypergraph with three edges is bounded from above by $1/2$. For even $r$, this bound is tight, as demonstrated by Mantel's theorem on triangles and Frankl's theorem on expanded triangles. In this note, we prove that for odd $r$, the bound $1/2$ is never attained, thereby answering a question of Keevash and revealing a fundamental difference between hypergraphs of odd and even uniformity. Moreover, our result implies that the expanded triangle is the unique three-edge hypergraph whose Tur\'{a}n density attains $1/2$.</description>

      <title>The Tournament Theorem of R\'edei revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1934 L. R\'edei published his famous theorem that the number of Hamiltonian paths in a tournament is odd. In fact it is a corollary of a stronger theorem in his paper. Stronger theorems were also obtained in the early 1970s by G.A. Dirac in his lectures at Aarhus University and by C. Berge in his monographs on graphs and hypergraphs. We exhibit the stronger theorems of R\'edei, Dirac and Berge and explain connections between them. The stronger theorem of Dirac has two corollaries, one equivalent to R\'edei's stronger theorem and the other related to Berge's stronger theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new results on combinatorial characterizations of covering properties in end spaces and ray spaces. In particular, we characterize the Lindel\"of degree, the extent, the Rothberger property, $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property for ray, end and edge-end spaces. We show that $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property are equivalent for these spaces, and that they are all $D$-spaces.</description>

      <title>A note on the distinct distances problem over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a finite-field analogue of the Erd\H{o}s distinct distances problem under the Hamming metric. For a set \(S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n\) let $\Delta(S)$ denote the set of Hamming distances determined by \(S\). We prove the lower bound \[ |\Delta(S)| \;\ge\; \frac{\log |S|}{2\log(2nq)}, \] and show this bound is tight when \(|S|=O(\text{poly}(n))\), where the constant of proportionality depends only on $q$. We then also study the problem of finding a large \emph{rainbow set}, that is, a subset \(S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n\) for which all \(\binom{|S|}{2}\) pairwise Hamming distances spanned by $S$ are distinct. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, we show that a set with many distinct distances does not imply the existence of a large rainbow set, by giving an explicit construction.
  Nevertheless, we establish the existence of large rainbow sets, and prove that every large set in \(\mathbb{F}_q^n\) necessarily contains a non-trivial rainbow subset.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a widely circulated manuscript from the 1980s, now available on the arXiv, I.~G.~Macdonald introduced certain multivariable hypergeometric series ${}_pF_q(x)= {}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y)= {}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ in one and two sets of variables $x=(x_1,\dots x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots y_n)$. These two series are defined by explicit expansions in terms of Jack polynomials $J^{(\alpha)}_\lambda$, and for $\alpha=2$ they specialize to the hypergeometric series of matrix arguments studied by Herz (1955) and Constantine (1963) that admit analogous expansions in terms of zonal polynomials.
  In this paper we determine explicit partial differential equations that characterize ${}_pF_q$, thereby answering a question posed by Macdonald. More precisely, for each $n,p,q$ we construct three differential operators $\mathcal A=\mathcal A^{(x,y)}$, $\mathcal B=\mathcal B^{(x)}$, $\mathcal C=C^{(x)}$, and we show that ${}_pF_q(x,y)$ and ${}_pF_q(x)$ are the unique series solutions of the equations $\mathcal A(f)=0$ and $\mathcal C(f)=0$, respectively, subject to certain symmetry and boundary conditions. We also prove that the equation $\mathcal B(f)=0$ characterizes ${}_pF_q(x)$, but only after one restricts the domain of $\mathcal B$ to the set of series satisfying an additional stability condition with respect to $n$.
  Special cases of the operators $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ have been constructed previously in the literature, but only for a small number of pairs $(p,q)$, namely for $p \leq 3$ and $q \leq 2$ in the zonal case by Muirhead (1970), Constantine--Muirhead (1972), and Fujikoshi (1975); and for $p \leq 2$ and $q \leq 1$ in the general Jack case by Macdonald (1980s), Yan (1992), Kaneko (1993), and Baker--Forrester (1997). However the operator $\mathcal C$ seems to be new even for these special cases.</description>

      <title>A recursive definition for the polymatroid Tutte polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tutte polynomial is a significant invariant of graphs and matroids. It is well-known that it has three equivalent definitions: bases expansion, rank generating function, and deletion-contraction formula. The polymatroid Tutte polynomial $\mathscr{T}_{P}$ generalizes the Tutte polynomial from matroids to polymatroids $P$. In \emph{[Adv. Math. 402 (2022) 108355.]} and \emph{[J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 188 (2022) 105584]}, the authors provided bases expansion and rank generating function constructions for $\mathscr{T}_{P}$, respectively. In \emph{[Int. Math. Res. Not. 19 (2025) rnaf302]}, a recursive formula for $\mathscr{T}_{P}$ was obtained. In this paper, we show that the recursive formula itself can be used to define the polymatroid Tutte polynomial independently.</description>

      <title>Bounded Littlewood identities with fixed number of odd rows or odd columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Littlewood identity is an identity equating a sum of Schur functions with an infinite product. A bounded Littlewood identity is one where the sum is taken over the partitions with a bounded number of rows or columns. The price to pay is that the infinite product has to be replaced by a determinant. The focus of this article is on refinements of such bounded Littlewood identities where one also prescribes the number of odd-length rows or columns of the partitions. Goulden [{\it Discrete Math.} {\bf99} (1992), 69--77] had given such a refinement in which the number of columns is bounded and the number of odd-length rows is prescribed. We provide refinements where the number of columns is bounded and the number of odd-length columns is prescribed. Furthermore, we present new formulations of such bounded Littlewood identities involving skewing operators. As corollaries we obtain non-standard formulas for numbers of standard Young tableaux with restricted shapes as above. In the last part of the article we discuss combinatorial interpretations of such identities in terms of up-down tableaux. As corollaries, we obtain identities between numbers of standard Young tableaux and numbers of (marked) vacillating tableaux.</description>

Abstract: We classify complex hyperplane arrangements $\mathcal A$ whose intersection posets $L(\mathcal A)$ satisfy $L(\mathcal A)=\pi_i^{-1}\circ\pi_i\bigl(L(\mathcal A)\bigr)$ for $i=1,\dots,n$. Here $\pi_i$ denotes the projection from $\mathbb C^n$ onto $\mathbb C^{n-1}$ defined by that forgets the coordinate $x_i$ of $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb C^n$, and $\pi_i\bigl(L(\mathcal A)\bigr)=\{\pi_i(S)\mid S\in L(\mathcal A)\}$. We show that such arrangements $\mathcal A$ arise as pullbacks of the mirror hyperplanes of complex reflection groups of type $A$ or $B$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Sibuya distribution and its non-critical relatives are relevant in the context of the recursive generation of both simply generated and increasing critical trees' and forests' progenies. A special class of generalized Stirling numbers are at the heart of the analysis of the induced occupancy distributions. Asymptotic aspects of large forests are addressed.</description>

      <title>New lower bounds on the non-repetitive chromatic number of some graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph \( G \) is said to be (vertex) non-repetitively colored if no simple path in \( G \) has a sequence of vertex colors that forms a repetition. Formally, a coloring \( c: V(G) \to \{1, 2, \dots, k\} \) is non-repetitive if, for every path \(\langle v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{2m} \rangle\) in \( G \), the sequence of colors \( c(v_1), c(v_2), \dots, c(v_{2m}) \) is not of the form \( ww \), where \( w \) is a sequence of \( m \) colors. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is called the \emph{non-repetitive chromatic number} of \(G\), denoted by \(\pi(G)\). In this paper, we primarily prove that \(\pi(P \square P) \ge 6\) and \(\pi(P \boxtimes P) \ge 9\), where \( P \square P \) and \( P \boxtimes P \) are the Cartesian product and the strong product of two infinite paths, respectively. This improves upon the previous best lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Extending Thomassen's conjecture to directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous conjecture by Thomassen from 1983 asserts that for any given $k,g\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists some $d=d(k,g)\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph of minimum degree at least $d$ contains a subgraph of minimum degree at least $k$ and girth at least $g$. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of the directed analogs of Thomassen's conjecture one obtains when replacing minimum degree by minimum out-degree. Concretely, we study which digraphs $F$ are avoidable in the sense that there exists $d_F:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that every digraph of minimum out-degree at least $d_F(k)$ contains an $F$-free subdigraph of minimum out-degree at least $k$. Among our main results, we show that all orientations of $C_3$ and $C_5$ are avoidable, while one-directed orientations of complete bipartite graphs and all oriented trees are not avoidable. This, in particular, shows that the most direct extension of Thomassen's conjecture to digraphs is false. We also fully characterize which digraphs are avoidable when restricting the setting to regular host digraphs. Finally, we raise numerous attractive open problems in the hope of sparking further progress.</description>

      <title>On a sequence of Kimberling and its relationship to the Tribonacci word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Clark Kimberling defined an interesting sequence ${\bf B} = 0100101100 \cdots$ of $0$'s and $1$'s by certain inflation rules, and he made a number of conjectures about this sequence and some related ones. In this note we prove his conjectures using, in part, the Walnut theorem-prover. We show how his word is related to the infinite Tribonacci word, and we determine both the subword complexity and critical exponent of $\bf B$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of thagomizer matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the equivariant inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of thagomizer matroids, a natural family of graphic matroids associated with the complete tripartite graphs $K_{1,1,n}$. These polynomials were introduced by Proudfoot as an extension of the Kazhdan--Lusztig theory for matroids. We derive closed-form expressions for the $\mathfrak{S}_n$-equivariant inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of thagomizer matroids and present them explicitly in terms of the irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{S}_n$. As an application, we also provide explicit formulas for the non-equivariant inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, originally defined by Gao and Xie, and give an alternative proof using generating functions. Furthermore, we prove that the inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of thagomizer matroids are log-concave.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture of Dyer on the Join in the Weak Order of a Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one of his papers on the weak order of Coxeter groups, Dyer formulates several conjectures. Among these, one affirms that the extended weak order forms a lattice, while another offers an algebraic-geometric description of the join of two elements in this poset. The former was recently proven for affine types by Barkley and Speyer. In this paper, we establish the latter for Coxeter groups of types $A$ and $I$. Moreover, we verified the validity of this conjecture for types $H_3$ and $F_4$ through the use of Sage.</description>

      <title>2-Factors in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An account of 2-factors in graphs and their history is presented. We give a direct graph-theoretic proof of the 2-Factor Theorem and a new variant of it, and also a new complete characterisation of the maximal graphs without 2-factors. This is based on the important works of Tibor Gallai on 1-factors and of Hans-Boris Belck on k-factors, both published in 1950 and independently containing the theory of alternating chains. We also present an easy proof that a $(2k+1)$-regular graph with at most $2k$ leaves has a 2-factor, and we describe all connected $(2k+1)$-regular graphs with exactly $2k+1$ leaves without a 2-factor. This generalises Julius Petersen's famous theorem, that any 3-regular graph with at most two leaves has a 1-factor, and it generalises the extremal graphs Sylvester discovered for that theorem.</description>

      <title>Vandermonde Cells Through the Lens of Positive Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric and algebraic structure of Vandermonde cells, defined as images of the standard probability simplex under the Vandermonde map given by consecutive power sum polynomials. Motivated by their combinatorial equivalence to cyclic polytopes, which are well-known examples of positive geometries and tree amplituhedra, we investigate whether Vandermonde cells admit the structure of positive geometries. We derive explicit parametrizations and algebraic equations for their boundary components, extending known results from the planar case to arbitrary dimensions. By introducing a mild generalization of the notion of positive geometry, allowing singularities within boundary interiors, we show that planar Vandermonde cells naturally fit into this extended framework. Furthermore, we study Vandermonde cells in the setting of Brown-Dupont's mixed Hodge theory formulation of positive geometries, and show that they form a genus zero pair.
  These results provide a new algebraic and geometric understanding of Vandermonde cells, establishing them as promising examples within the emerging theory of positive geometries.</description>

      <title>Canonical Ramsey: triangles, rectangles and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Cheng and Xu showed that if $S$ is a square or a triangle with a certain property, then for every positive integer $r$ there exists $n_0(S)$ independent of $r$ such that every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{E}^n$ with $n\ge n_0(S)$ contains a monochromatic or a rainbow congruent copy of $S$. Geh\'{e}r, Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th formalized this dimension independence as the canonical Ramsey property and proved it for all hypercubes, thereby covering rectangles whose squared aspect ratio $(a/b)^2$ is rational. They asked whether this property holds for all triangles and for all rectangles.
  (1) We resolve both questions. More precisely, for triangles we confirm the property in $\mathbb{E}^4$ by developing a novel rotation-sphereical chaining argument. For rectangles, we introduce a structural reduction to product configurations of bounded color complexity, enabling the use of the simplex Ramsey theorem together with product Ramsey theorem.
  (2) Beyond this, we develop a concise perturbation framework based on an iterative embedding coupled with the Frankl-R\"{o}dl simplex super-Ramsey theorem, which yields the canonical Ramsey property for a natural class of 3-dimensional simplices and also furnishes an alternative proof for triangles.</description>

      <title>The most probable order of a random permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $n$ and $m$, let $p_n(m)$ be the probability that a uniform random permutation of $[n]$ has order exactly $m$. We show that, as $n \to \infty$, the maximum of $p_n(m)$ over all $m$ is asymptotic to $1/n$, the probability of an $n$-cycle. Furthermore, for sufficiently large $n$, we show that the maximum is attained precisely if $m$ is the least positive integer divisible by all positive integers less than or equal to $n-m$. This answers a question of Acan, Burnette, Eberhard, Schmutz and Thomas, originally attributed to work of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'an from 1968.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove several results on the structure of maximal sets $S \subseteq [N]$ such that $S$ mod $p$ is contained in a short arithmetic progression, or the union of short progressions, where $p$ ranges over a subset of primes in an interval $[y,2y]$, where $(\log N)^C &lt; y \leq N$. We also provide several constructions showing that our results cannot be improved. As an application, we provide several improvements on the larger sieve bound for $|S|$ when $S$ mod $p$ has strong additive structure, parallel to the work of Green-Harper and Shao for improvements on the large sieve.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $g(k)$ be the maximum size of a planar set that determines at most $k$ distances. We prove $$\frac{\pi}{3\,C(\Lambda_{hex})}\ k\sqrt{\log k} (1+o(1)) \le g(k) \le C k\log k,$$ so $g(k) \asymp k\sqrt{\log k}$ with an explicit constant from the hexagonal lattice. For any arithmetic lattice $\Lambda$ we show $$g_\Lambda(k)\ge (\pi/4) S^*(\Lambda) k\sqrt{\log k} (1+o(1)).$$ We also give quantitative stability: unless $X$ is line-heavy or has two popular nonparallel shifts, either almost all ordered pairs lie below a high quantile of the distance multiset (near-center localization), or a constant fraction of $X\cap W$ lies in one residue class modulo $2\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>The Graded Betti Numbers of the Skeletons of Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class $C$ of squarefree monomial ideals $I$ in a polynomial ring $R=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ over a filed $K$ where $\dim R/I$ equals the maximum degree of the minimal generators of $I$ minus one. We show that the Stanley-Reisner ideal of any $i$-skeleton of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ in the class $C$ for $-1\le i&lt;\dim\Delta$. Then, we introduce the notion of a degree resolution and prove that every ideal in the class $C$ possesses this property. Finally, we provides a formula to compute the graded Betti numbers of the $i$-skeletons of a simplicial complex in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the original complex. Conversely, we also present a way to express the graded Betti numbers of the original complex in terms of the graded Betti numbers of one of its skeletons.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Edges Conjecture via Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spectral Edges Conjecture is a well-known and widely believed conjecture in the theory of discrete periodic operators. It states that the extrema of the dispersion relation are isolated, non-degenerate, and occur in a single band. We present two infinite families of periodic graphs which satisfy the Spectral Edges Conjecture. For each, every extremum of the dispersion relation is a corner point (point of symmetry). In fact, each spectral band function is a perfect Morse function. We also give a construction that increases dimension, while preserving that each spectral band function is a perfect Morse function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coverings of the Riemann sphere by itself, ramified over two points, are given by so-called Shabat polynomials. The correspondence between Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants and Belyi maps then implies a bijection between Shabat polynomials and tree dessins (bicolored plane trees). Dessins can be assigned a combinatorial invariant known as their passport, which records the degrees of their vertices. We consider all possible passports determining a pair of tree dessins, determining the associated Shabat polynomials and monodromy groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse graphs with bounded average degree form a rich class of discrete structures where local geometry strongly influences global behavior. The Benjamini-Schramm (BS) convergence offers a natural framework to describe their asymptotic local structure. In this note, we survey spectral aspects of BS convergence and their applications, with a focus on random Schreier graphs and covering graphs. We review some recent progress on the spectral decomposition of the local operators on graphs. We discuss the behavior of extreme eigenvalues and the growing role of strong convergence in distribution, which rules out spectral outliers. We also give a new application of strong convergence to the typical graph distance between vertices in Schreier graphs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant Cryptography via Universal Gr\"obner Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of universal Gr\"obner bases in public-key cryptography by proposing a key establishment protocol that is resistant to quantum attacks. By utilizing a universal Gr\"obner basis $\mathcal{U}_I$ of a polynomial ideal $I$ as a private key, this protocol leverages the computational disparity between generating the universal Gr\"obner basis needed for decryption compared with the single Gr\"obner basis used for encryption. The security of the system lies in the difficulty of directly computing the Gr\"obner fan of $I$ required to construct $\mathcal{U}_I$. We provide an analysis of the security of the protocol and the complexity of its various parameters. Additionally, we provide efficient ways to recursively generate $\mathcal{U}_I$ for toric ideals of graphs with techniques which are also of independent interest to the study of these ideals.</description>

      <title>The generalized Zagreb index for non-plane and plane recursive trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zagreb index, which is defined as the sum of squares of degrees of the nodes of a tree, was studied in previous works by martingale techniques for random non-plane recursive trees and classes of random trees which are close to random plane recursive trees. These techniques are not easily amended to the generalized Zagreb index, which is defined similar but with squares replaced by higher powers. In this paper, we use the moment transfer approach to (i) obtain the first-order asymptotics of moments and to (ii) prove limit laws for the (suitable normalized) generalized Zagreb index for random non-plane and plane recursive trees; for the former, we show that for all higher powers the limit law is normal, for the latter, we show for cubes and fourth powers that its a non-normal law.</description>

      <title>From points to complexes: a concept of unexpectedness for simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Cook, Harbourne, Migliore and Nagel introduced the concept of unexpected hypersurfaces, which connects the study of Lefschetz properties of artinian algebras defined by powers of linear forms, to a family of interpolation problems. In this paper, inspired by the theory of unexpected hypersurfaces, we introduce the concept of unexpected systems of parameters for squarefree monomial ideals. Similarly to the setting of points, we show that the existence of an unexpected system of parameters causes a certain algebra to fail the weak Lefschetz property. We then explore combinatorial interpretations of unexpected systems of parameters, and show that this notion is intrinsically related to the theory of balanced complexes. A consequence of our results is that the theory of Rees algebras turns out to be a powerful tool for studying the existence of systems of parameters satisfying special properties.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes combinatorial bounds on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of edge ideals for trees and their multi-whiskered variants. For a tree \( T \), we give bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of \( I(T) \) in terms of the order, diameter, and number of pendant vertices. Furthermore, we present an upper bound for multi-whiskered trees \( T_{\mathbf{a}} \), demonstrating that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of \( I(T_{\mathbf{a}}) \) is bounded by the same invariants of the underlying tree \( T \). A principal consequence of this work is the derivation of corresponding inequalities for two key combinatorial invariants of \( T \), namely the induced matching number \( \operatorname{im}(T) \) and the independence number \( \alpha(T) \).</description>

      <title>On some conjectural supercongruences involving the sequence $t_n(x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some supercongruences involving the sequence $$ t_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}2^k $$ and solve some open problems. For any odd prime $p$ and $p$-adic integer $x$, we determine $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}t_n(x)^2$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(n+1)t_n(x)^2$ modulo $p^2$; for example, we establish that
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}t_n(x)^2\equiv\begin{cases}
  \left(\dfrac{-1}{p}\right)\pmod{p^2},&amp;\text{if }2x\equiv-1\pmod{p},\\[8pt]
  (-1)^{\langle x\rangle_p}\dfrac{p+2(x-\langle x\rangle_p)}{2x+1}\pmod{p^2},&amp;\text{otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*} where $\langle x\rangle_p$ denotes the least nonnegative residue of $x$ modulo $p$. This confirms a conjecture of Z.-W. Sun.</description>

This result can be viewed as an analog of Bernstein's little theorem for absolutely monotone functions.

      <description>arXiv:2510.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I(G) \subset S$ the edge ideal of a finite graph $G$ on $n$ vertices. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{N}^n$ and an integer $q\geq 1$, we denote by $(I(G)^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}$ the ideal of $S$ generated by those monomials belonging to $I(G)^q$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I(G))$ denote the largest integer $q$ for which $(I(G)^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq (0)$. Since $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal, it follows that its minimal set of monomial generators is the set of bases of a discrete polymatroid $\mathcal{D}(G,\mathfrak{c})$. In the present paper, a classification of Gorenstein polytopes of the form ${\rm conv}(\mathcal{D}(G,\mathfrak{c}))$ is studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the restrictions of Shi arrangements to Weyl cones, their relations to antichains in the root poset, and their intersection posets. For any Weyl cone, we provide bijections between regions, flats intersecting the cone, and antichains of a naturally-defined subposet of the root poset. This gives a refinement of the parking function numbers via the Poincar\'e polynomials of the intersection posets of all Weyl cones. Finally, we interpret these Poincar\'e polynomials as the Hilbert series of three isomorphic graded rings. One of these rings arises from the Varchenko-Gel'fand ring, another is the coordinate ring of the vertices of the order polytope of a subposet of the root poset, and the third is purely combinatorial.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Park and Pham famously proved Kahn-Kalai conjecture. In this note, we simplify their proof, using an induction to replace the original analysis. This reduces the proof to one page, and from the argument it is also easy to read that one can set the constant $K$ in the conjecture to $\approx 3.998$, which could be the best value under the current method. Our argument also applies to the $\epsilon$-version of Park-Pham result, studied by Bell.</description>

We additionally prove a new approximation result, showing that the total variation distance between random P\'olya trees and random unlabelled trees tends to zero when the number of vertices tends to infinity. In order to demonstrate that our approach is not restricted to trees we extend our results to tree-like classes of graphs.</description>

Abstract: A set of unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a called a spherical two-distance set if the inner products of distinct vectors only take two values. In this paper, we give explicit correspondence between spherical two-distance sets and graphs with specific spectral properties, and derive some bounds on the maximum size of spherical two-distance sets.</description>

      <title>On Distinct Angles in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $N$ points lie in convex position in the plane then they determine $\Omega(N^{5/4})$ distinct angles, provided that the points do not lie on a common circle.
  This is derived from a more general claim that if $N$ points in the convex position in the real plane determine $KN$ distinct angles, then $K=\Omega(N^{1/4})$ or $\Omega(N/K)$ points are co-circular.
  The proof makes use of the implicit order one can give to points in convex position and relies on a slightly more general order assumption. The assumption enables one to reduce the issue to counting incidences between points and a multiset of cubic curves, with special attention being paid to the case when the curves are reducible.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Polynomials, Binomial Coefficients, and Symmetric Function Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpolation polynomials were introduced by Knop--Sahi in type $A$, and Okounkov in type $BC$. They are inhomogeneous polynomials whose top terms are Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Thus the expansion coefficients for the product of two interpolation polynomials, known as Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, generalize the corresponding coefficients for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Special values of interpolation polynomials, known as binomial coefficients, arise in the binomial type expansions of Jack/Macdonald polynomials and Koornwinder polynomials.
  We prove a number of results for interpolation polynomials and the associated coefficients. These include positivity and monotonicity results for binomial coefficients, partial positivity results for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, and weighted sum formulas for both kinds of coefficients.
  As a special case of our results we obtain a new symmetric function inequality, which establishes a ``duality'' between Jack expansion positivity for symmetric functions, and the containment order on partitions, with respect to the shifted basis $\Omega_\lambda({\bf1}+x;\tau)$, where ${\bf1} =(1,\ldots,1)$ and $\Omega_\lambda(x;\tau)=P_\lambda(x;\tau)/P_\lambda({\bf1};\tau)$ is the normalized Jack polynomial.
  Our inequality can be seen as an analog of the inequalities of Cuttler--Greene--Skandera+Sra and Khare--Tao, which establish similar dualities between evaluation positivity on the positive orthant, and the dominance and weak dominance orders on partitions, with respect to the normalized Schur basis $\Omega_\lambda(x)=s_\lambda(x)/s_\lambda({\bf1})$ and its shifted version $\Omega_\lambda({\bf1}+x)$, respectively. In contrast to our result, the Jack versions of the two latter inequalities, although expected to hold, have not yet been proved.</description>

Abstract: So Long Sucker is a strategy board game that requires 4 players, each with $c$ chips of their designated color, and a board made of $k$ empty piles. With a clear set-up comes intricate rules, such as: players taking turns but not in a fixed order, agreements made between some players broken at any time, or a player winning the game without any chips in hand.
  One of the main points of interest in studying this game is finding when a player has a winning strategy. The game begins with four players who get successively eliminated until only the winner is left. To study winning strategies, it is of interest to look at endgame situations. For that, we study the following game set-up: there are two players left in the game, Blue and Red, with only their respective chip colors. In this paper, we characterize Blue's winning scenarios and strategies for this game set-up through a delicate case analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ordered point set in a Euclidean space or, more generally, in an abstract metric space, the ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph is obtained by connecting each of the points to its closest predecessor by a directed edge. We show that for every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree at least $\log{n}/(4d)$. Apart from the $1/(4d)$ factor, this bound is the best possible. As for the abstract setting, we show that for every $n$-element metric space, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}/\log\log{n}})$.</description>

      <title>On full-separating sets and related codes in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A domination-based identification problem on a graph $G$ is one where the objective is to choose a subset $C$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that $C$ has both, a domination property, that is, $C$ is either a dominating or a total-dominating set of $G$, and a separation property, that is, any two distinct vertices of $G$ must have distinct closed or open neighborhoods in $C$. Such a set $C$ is often referred to as a code in the literature of identification problems. In this article, we introduce a new separation property, called full-separation, as it combines aspects of the two well-studied properties of closed- and open-separation. We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination and call the resulting codes full-separating dominating codes (or FD-codes for short) and full-separating total-dominating codes (or FTD-codes for short), respectively. Incidentally, FTD-codes have also been introduced in the literature of identification problems under the name of strongly identifying codes (or SID-codes for short) and under a differently formulated definition. In this paper, we address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size, their relation to codes of the other types and present some extremal cases for these bounds and relations. We further show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph are NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes of any graph differ by at most one, but that it is NP-hard to decide whether or not they are equal for a given graph in general.</description>

      <title>A variant of the Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'arf\'as problem for $K_8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Alon initiated the study of graph codes and their linear variants in analogy to the study of error correcting codes in theoretical computer science. Alon related the maximum density of a linear graph code which avoids images of a small graph $H$ to the following variant of the Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'arf\'as problem on edge-colourings of $K_n$. A copy of $H$ in an edge-colouring of $K_n$ is even-chromatic if each colour occupies an even number of edges in the copy. We seek an edge-colouring of $K_n$ using $n^{o(1)}$ colours such that there are no even-chromatic copies of $H$. Such an edge-colouring is conjectured to exist for all cliques $K_t$ with an even number of edges. To date, edge-colourings satisfying this property have been constructed for $K_4$ and $K_5$.
  We construct an edge-colouring using $n^{o(1)}$ colours which avoids even-chromatic copies of $K_8$. This was the smallest open case of the above conjecture, as $K_6, K_7$ each has an odd number of edges. We also study a stronger condition on edge-colourings, where for each copy of $H$, there is a colour occupying exactly one edge in the copy. We conjecture that an edge-colouring using $n^{o(1)}$ colours and satisfying this stronger requirement exists for all cliques $K_t$ regardless of the parity of the number of its edges. We construct edge-colourings satisfying this stronger property for $K_4$ and $K_5$. These constructions also improve upon the number of colours needed for the original problem of avoiding even-chromatic copies of $K_4$ and $K_5$.</description>

      <title>A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a 2-connected cubic graph $G$ is $\lambda$-matchable if $G$ has a spanning subgraph in which $v$ has degree three whereas every other vertex has degree one, and we let $\lambda(G)$ denote the number of such vertices. Clearly, $\lambda=0$ for bipartite graphs; ergo, we define $\lambda$-matchable pairs analogously, and we let $\rho(G)$ denote the number of such pairs.
  We improve the constant lower bounds on both $\lambda$ and $\rho$ established recently by Chen, Lu and Zhang [Discrete Math., 2025] using matching-theoretic parameters arising from the seminal work of Lov\'asz [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1987], and we characterize all of the tight examples. We also solve the problem posed by Chen, Lu and Zhang: characterize \con2 cubic graphs that satisfy $\lambda=n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new discrete functional inequalities on the hypercube via the induction-by-restrictions method. This method reduces high-dimensional inequalities to explicit low-dimensional analytic verifications and has recently proved effective for many discrete functional inequalities. We establish two results along this framework. First, we prove a sharp $p$-biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for real-valued increasing functions, which recovers the classic biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for increasing sets and identifies increasing subcubes as the extremizers. This result also admits a probabilistic interpretation in terms of maximizing the mean first exit time of biased random walks. Second, we give an inductive proof of a Poincar\'e inequality on increasing subsets of the cube that was recently established by Fei and Ferreira Pinto Jr, yielding an $O(n^2)$ upper bound on the mixing time of censored random walks, improving upon previous bounds.</description>

Abstract: In 2011, Rubey generalized chute and ladder moves on the set of reduced pipe dreams for a permutation $w$ and conjectured that the induced poset on reduced pipe dreams is a lattice. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Our key tool is a new type of move operation $\mathcal{M}_{ij}$, defined as a composite of certain general ladder moves in Rubey's poset. We show that joins and meets exist in Rubey's poset by proving simple recursive formulas in terms of $\mathcal{M}_{ij}$ operations. In addition, we give an explicit criterion to determine if two elements of Rubey's poset are comparable.</description>

Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

      <title>Odd list-coloring of graphs of small Euler genus with no short cycles of specific types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd coloring is a variant of proper coloring and has received wide attention. We study the list-coloring version of this notion in this paper. We prove that if $G$ is a graph embeddable in the torus or the Klein bottle with no cycle of length 3, 4, and 6 such that no 5-cycles share an edge, then for every function $L$ that assigns each vertex of $G$ a set $L(v)$ of size 5, there exists a proper coloring that assigns each vertex $v$ of $G$ an element of $L(v)$ such that for every non-isolated vertex, some color appears an odd number of times on its neighborhood. In particular, every graph embeddable in the torus or the Klein bottle with no cycle of length 3, 4, 6, and 8 is odd 5-choosable. The number of colors in these results are optimal, and there exist graphs embeddable in those surfaces of girth 6 requiring six or seven colors.</description>

      <title>Edge version of the inducibility via the entropy method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inducibility of a graph $H$ is about the maximum number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph on $n$ vertices. We consider its edge version, that is, the maximum number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph with $m$ edges. Let $c(G,H)$ be the number of induced copies of $H$ in $G$ and $\rho(H,m) = \max \{c(G,H) \mid |E(G)| = m\}$. For any graph $H$, we prove that $\rho(H,m) = \Theta(m^{\alpha_f(H)})$ where $\alpha_f(H)$ is the fractional independence number of $H$. Therefore, we now focus on the constant factor in front of $m^{\alpha_f(H)}$. In this paper, we give some results of $\rho(H,m)$ when $H$ is a cycle or path. We conjecture that for any cycle $C_k$ with $k \ge 5$, $\rho(C_k,m)= (1+o(1))\left( m/k\right)^{k/2}$ and the bound achieves by the blow up of $C_k$. For even cycles, we establish an upper bound with an extra constant factor. For odd cycles, we can only establish an upper bound with an extra factor depending on $k$. We prove that $\rho(P_{2l},m) \le \frac{m^l}{2(l-1)^{l-1}}$ and $\rho(P_{2l+1},m) \le \frac{m^{l+1}}{4l^l}$, where $l \ge 2$. We also conjecture the asymptotic value of $\rho(P_k, m)$. The entropy method is mainly used to prove our results.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the concept of orthogonality in second-order polynomial sequences that have Binet formula similar to that of the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, referred to as Generalized Fibonacci Polynomials (GFP). We give a technique to find roots of the GFP. As a corollary of this result, we give an alternative proof of a special case of Favard's Theorem. The general case of Favard's Theorem guarantees that there is a measure to determine whether a sequence of second-order polynomials is orthogonal or not. However, the theorem does not provide an explicit such measure. Our special case gives both the explicit measure and the relationship between the second-order recurrence and orthogonality, demonstrating whether the GFP polynomials are orthogonal or not. This allows us to classify which of familiar GFPs are orthogonal and which are not. Some familiar orthogonal polynomials include the Fermat, Fermat-Lucas, both types of Chebyshev polynomials, both types of Morgan-Voyce polynomials, and Vieta and Vieta-Lucas polynomials. However, we prove that the Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, and Pell-Lucas sequences are not orthogonal.
  In Section \ref{sectionrw}, we give a brief description of discrete--time and continuous--time Morkov chains with special emphasis on birth-and-death stochastic processes.
  We find sufficient conditions on the polynomial's coefficients under which a given family of orthogonal polynomial induces a Markov chain. These families of orthogonal polynomials include Chebyshev polynomials of first kind and Fermat-Lucas.
  In the final section, we highlight some connections between orthogonal polynomials and Markov processes. These relations are not new but seem to have been somewhat forgotten. We do so to draw the attention of researchers in the orthogonal polynomial and probability communities for further collaboration.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems for the $(p,Q)$-spectral radius of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an $s$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph, and let $H$ be an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph. Denote by $\mathcal{N}(Q,H)$ the number of isomorphic copies of $Q$ in $H$. For a hereditary family $\mathcal{P}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, define $$\pi(Q,\mathcal{P}):=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\binom{n}{s}^{-1}\max\{\mathcal{N}(Q,H): H\in \mathcal{P}~~\mbox{and}~~|V(H)|=n\}.$$ For $p\geq1$, the $(p,Q)$-spectral radius of $H$ is defined as $$\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H):=\max_{\|\mathbf{x}\|_{p}=1}s!\sum_{\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{s}\}\in \binom{[n]}{s}}\mathcal{N}(Q,H[\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{s}\}])x_{i_{1}}\cdots x_{i_{s}}.$$
  %generalizing the concept of the $p$-spectral radius introduced by %Keevash, Lenz, and Mubayi \cite{KLM2014}.
  In this paper, we present a systematically investigation of the parameter $\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H)$. First, we prove that the limit $$\lambda^{(p)}(Q,\mathcal{P}):=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}n^{s/p-s}\max\{\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H): H\in \mathcal{P}~~\mbox{and}~~|V(H)|=n\}$$ exists, and for $p&gt;1$, it satisfies $$\pi(Q,\mathcal{P})=\lambda^{(p)}(Q,\mathcal{P}).$$
  Second, we study spectral generalized Tur\'an problems.
  Specifically, we establish a spectral stability result and apply it to derive a spectral version of the Erd\H{o}s Pentagon Problem: for $p\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the balanced blow-up of $C_{5}$ maximizes $\lambda^{(p)}(C_{5},H)$ among all $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs $H$, thereby improving a result of Liu \cite{Liu2025}. Furthermore, we show that for $p\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the $l$-partite Tur\'an graph $T_{l}(n)$ attains the maximum $\lambda^{(p)}(K_{s},H)$ among all $n$-vertex F-free graphs $H$, where $F$ is an edge-critical graph with $\chi(F)=l+1$. This provides a spectral analogue of a theorem due to Ma and Qiu \cite{MQ2020}.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Random Cayley Graphs of Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the random Cayley graph of a finite Abelian group $G$ with respect to $k$ generators chosen uniformly at random, with $1 \ll \log k \ll \log |G|$. Draw a vertex $U \sim \operatorname{Unif}(G)$.
  We show that the graph distance $\operatorname{dist}(\mathsf{id},U)$ from the identity to $U$ concentrates at a particular value $M$, which is the minimal radius of a ball in $\mathbb Z^k$ of cardinality at least $|G|$, under mild conditions. In other words, the distance from the identity for all but $o(|G|)$ of the elements of $G$ lies in the interval $[M - o(M), M + o(M)]$. In the regime $k \gtrsim \log |G|$, we show that the diameter of the graph is also asymptotically $M$. In the spirit of a conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985), this $M$ depends only on $k$ and $|G|$, not on the algebraic structure of $G$.
  Write $d(G)$ for the minimal size of a generating subset of $G$. We prove that the order of the spectral gap is $|G|^{-2/k}$ when $k - d(G) \asymp k$ and $|G|$ lies in a density-$1$ subset of $\mathbb N$ or when $k - 2 d(G) \asymp k$. This extends, for Abelian groups, a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (1994).
  The aforementioned results all hold with high probability over the random Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>Pre-Calabi--Yau algebras and homotopy double Poisson gebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the notion of a curved pre-Calabi--Yau algebra is equivalent to the notion of a curved homotopy double Poisson gebra, thereby settling the equivalence between the two ways to define derived noncommutative Poisson structures. We actually prove that the respective differential graded Lie algebras controlling both deformation theories are isomorphic.This allows us to apply the recent developments of the properadic calculus in order to establish the homotopical properties of curved pre-Calabi--Yau algebras: infinity-morphisms, homotopy transfer theorem, formality, Koszul hierarchy, and twisting procedure.</description>

      <title>Sequentially Cohen-Macaulay Co-Chordal Graphs: Structure and Projective Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of chordal graphs called ($d_1$,$d_2$,$\dots$,$d_q$)-trees. A graph belongs to this class if and only if its clique complex is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, providing a complete classification of all sequentially Cohen-Macaulay co-chordal graphs. This class also yields a classification of bi-sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graphs. We study the relationship between the projective dimension of a graph and its maximum vertex degree. We show that the projective dimension is always at least the maximum vertex degree, although this bound is not always tight, even for co-chordal graphs. However, equality holds when the graph is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay co-chordal or has a full vertex.</description>

      <title>Computing Vertex and Edge Connectivity of Graphs Embedded with Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertex connectivity and edge connectivity are fundamental concepts in graph theory that have been widely studied from both structural and algorithmic perspectives. The focus of this paper is on computing these two parameters for graphs embedded on the plane with crossings. For planar graphs -- which can be embedded on the plane without any crossings -- it has long been known that vertex and edge connectivity can be computed in linear time. Recently, the algorithm for vertex connectivity was extended from planar graphs to 1-plane graphs (where each edge is crossed at most once) without $\times$-crossings -- these are crossings whose endpoints induce a matching. The key insight, for both these classes of graphs, is that any two vertices/edges of a minimum vertex/edge cut have small face-distance (distance measured by number of faces) in the embedding. In this paper, we attempt at a comprehensive generalization of this idea to a wider class of graphs embedded on the plane. Our method works for all those embedded graphs where every pair of crossing edges is connected by a path whose vertices and edges have a small face-distance from the crossing point. Important examples of such graphs include optimal 2-planar and optimal 3-planar graphs, $d$-map graphs, $d$-framed graphs, graphs with bounded crossing number, and $k$-plane graphs with bounded number of $\times$-crossings. For all these graph classes, we get a linear-time algorithm for computing vertex and edge connectivity.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

      <title>Locally Markov walks on finite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally Markov walks are natural generalizations of classical Markov chains, where instead of a particle moving independently of the past, it decides where to move next depending on the last action performed at the current location. We introduce the concept of locally Markov walks and we describe their stationary distribution and recurrent states, and we prove several properties such as irreducibility and ergodicity. For a particular locally Markov walk - the uniform unicycle walk on the complete graph - we investigate the mixing time and we prove that it exhibits cutoff.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Phylogenetic Level-2 Networks with Quartets and Inter-Taxon Quartet Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference of phylogenetic networks, which model complex evolutionary processes including hybridization and gene flow, remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Until now, statistically consistent inference methods have been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no interdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a much broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled planar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks that are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees. Moreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is circular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from quartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel identifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary models, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be distinguished.</description>
