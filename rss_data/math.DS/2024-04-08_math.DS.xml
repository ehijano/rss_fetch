      <title>Chemical mass-action systems as analog computers: implementing arithmetic computations at specified speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent technological advances allow us to view chemical mass-action systems as analog computers. In this context, the inputs to a computation are encoded as initial values of certain chemical species while the outputs are the limiting values of other chemical species. In this paper, we design chemical systems that carry out the elementary arithmetic computations of: identification, inversion, $m$th roots (for $m \ge 2$), addition, multiplication, absolute difference, rectified subtraction over non-negative real numbers, and partial real inversion over real numbers. We prove that these ``elementary modules'' have a speed of computation that is independent of the inputs to the computation. Moreover, we prove that finite sequences of such elementary modules, running in parallel, can carry out composite arithmetic over real numbers, also at a rate that is independent of inputs. Furthermore, we show that the speed of a composite computation is precisely the speed of the slowest elementary step. Specifically, the scale of the composite computation, i.e. the number of elementary steps involved in the composite, does not affect the overall asymptotic speed -- a feature of the parallel computing nature of our algorithm. Our proofs require the careful mathematical analysis of certain non-autonomous systems, and we believe this analysis will be useful in different areas of applied mathematics, dynamical systems, and the theory of computation. We close with a discussion on future research directions, including numerous important open theoretical questions pertaining to the field of computation with reaction networks.</description>

Abstract: We provide an arithmetic condition weaker then the Bryuno condition for which it is possible to apply a KAM scheme in dimension greater then one. The KAM scheme will be provided in the setting of linearization of analytic diffeomorphisms of the torus that are close to a rotation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Gas Mixture Dynamics in a Pipeline Network using Explicit Staggered-Grid Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an explicit second order staggered finite difference discretization scheme for simulating the transport of highly heterogeneous gas mixtures through pipeline networks. This study is motivated by the proposed blending of hydrogen into natural gas pipelines to reduce end use carbon emissions while using existing pipeline systems throughout their planned lifetimes. Our computational method accommodates an arbitrary number of constituent gases with very different physical properties that may be injected into a network with significant spatiotemporal variation. In this setting, the gas flow physics are highly location- and time- dependent, so that local composition and nodal mixing must be accounted for. The resulting conservation laws are formulated in terms of pressure, partial densities and flows, and volumetric and mass fractions of the constituents. We include non-ideal equations of state that employ linear approximations of gas compressibility factors, so that the pressure dynamics propagate locally according to a variable wave speed that depends on mixture composition and density. We derive compatibility relationships for network edge domain boundary values that are significantly more complex than in the case of a homogeneous gas. The simulation method is evaluated on initial boundary value problems for a single pipe and a small network, is cross-validated with a lumped element simulation, and used to demonstrate a local monitoring and control policy for maintaining allowable concentration levels.</description>

      <title>Active control of road vehicle's drag for varying upstream flow conditions using a Recursive Subspace based Predictive Control methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing focus on reducing energy consumption, particularly in electric vehicles with limited autonomy, has prompted innovative solutions. In this context, we propose a real-time flap-based control system aimed at improving aerodynamic drag in real driving conditions. Employing a Recursive Subspace based Predictive Control (RSPC) approach, we conducted wind tunnel tests on a representative model vehicle at reduced scale equipped with flaps. Comprehensive assessments using pressure measurements and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) were undertaken to evaluate the control efficiency. Static and dynamic perturbation tests were conducted, revealing the system's effectiveness in both scenarios. The closed-loop controlled system demonstrated a substantial gain, achieving a 5\% base pressure recovery.</description>

      <title>Elementary fractal geometry. 5. Weak separation is strong separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For self-similar sets, there are two important separation properties: the open set condition and the weak separation condition introduced by Zerner, which may be replaced by the formally stronger finite type property of Ngai and Wang. We show that any finite type self-similar set can be represented as a graph-directed construction obeying the open set condition. The proof is based on a combinatorial algorithm which performed well in computer experiments.</description>

      <title>Newton polygons and B\"{o}ttcher coordinates near infinity for polynomial skew products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(z,w)=(p(z),q(z,w))$ be a polynomial skew product such that the degrees of $p$ and $q$ are grater than or equal to $2$. Under one or two conditions, we prove that $f$ is conjugate to a monomial map on an invariant region near infinity. The monomial map and the region are determined by the degree of $p$ and a Newton polygon of $q$. Moreover, the region is included in the attracting basin of a superattracting fixed or indeterminacy point at infinity, or in the closure of the attracting basins of two point at infinity.</description>

      <title>Some extensions of the Brouwer fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of fixed points for continuous maps $f$ from an $n$-ball $X$ in $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq 1$. We show that $f$ has a fixed point if, for some absolute retract $Y\subset\partial X$, $f(Y)\subset X$ and $\partial X-Y$ is an $(f, X)$-blockading set. For $n\geq 2$, let $D$ be an $n$-ball in $X$ and $Y$ be an $(n-1)$-ball in $\partial X$. Relying on the result just mentioned, we show the existence of a fixed point of $f$, if $D$ and $Y$ are well placed and behave well under $f$, and ${\rm deg}(f_D)=-{\rm deg}(f_{\partial Y})$, where $f_D=f|D: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f_{\partial Y}=f|\partial Y: \partial Y \rightarrow \partial Y$. The degree ${\rm deg}(f_D)$ of $f_D$ is explicitly defined and some elementary properties of which are investigated. These results extend the Brouwer fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction to Temporally Aperiodic Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to general non-autonomous dynamical systems that are either weakly forced or slowly varying. Examples of such systems arise in structural dynamics, fluid-structure interactions and control problems. The time-dependent SSMs we construct under these assumptions are normally hyperbolic and hence will persist for larger forcing and faster time dependence that are beyond the reach of our precise existence theory. For this reason, we also derive formal asymptotic expansions that, under explicitly verifiable nonresonance conditions, approximate SSMs and their aperiodic anchor trajectories accurately for stronger, faster or even temporally discontinuous forcing. Reducing the dynamical system to these persisting SSMs provides a mathematically justified model reduction technique for non-autonomous physical systems whose time dependance is moderate either in magnitude or speed. We illustrate the existence, persistence and computation of temporally aperiodic SSMs in mechanical examples under chaotic forcing.</description>

      <title>Measures of maximal entropy that are SRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How often does it occur that the measure of maximal entropy of a system is an SRB measure? We study this question for $C^{1+\alpha}$ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms isotopic to Anosov (DA-diffeomorphisms) on ${\mathbb T}^{3}$, and establish a rigidity result: the measure of maximal entropy is an SRB measure if and only if the sum of its positive Lyapunov exponents coincides with that of the linear Anosov map $A$ on all periodic orbits of the support of the measure. In that case, the measure is also the unique physical measure.\par We also show non-Anosov examples satisfying this condition, both in the conservative and in the non-conservative setting. \par Finally, we prove that a volume-preserving $C^{1+\alpha}$ DA-diffeomorphism on ${\mathbb T}^{3}$ is Anosov if all Lyapunov exponents coincide almost everywhere with those of the linear Anosov in the isotopy class. Consequently, a smooth DA-diffeomorphism is smoothly conjugated to its linear part if and only if all Lyapunov exponents coincide almost everywhere with those of its linear part.</description>

      <title>Evaluating COVID-19 Surveillance Testing Strategies at Colorado School of Mines: A Stochastic Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission tailored to the Colorado School of Mines campus and evaluates surveillance testing strategies within a university context. Enhancing the conventional SEIR framework with stochastic transitions, our model accounts for the unique characteristics of disease spread in a residential college, including specific states for testing, quarantine, and isolation. Employing an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method for parameter estimation, we navigate the complexities inherent in stochastic models, enabling an accurate fit of the model with the campus case data. We then studied our model under the estimated parameters to evaluate the efficacy of different testing policies that could be implemented on a university campus. This framework not only advances understanding of COVID-19 dynamics on the Mines campus but serves as a blueprint for comparable settings, providing insights for informed strategies against infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of a rational map is Carath\'eodory hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a rational map of degree $d\geq 2$. The moduli space $\mathcal{M}_f$, introduced by McMullen and Sullivan, is a complex analytic space consisting all quasiconformal conjugacy classes of $f$. For $f$ that is not flexible Latt\`es, we show that there is a normal affine variety $X_f$ of dimension $2d-2$ and a holomorphic injection $i:\mathcal{M}_f\to X_f$ such that $i(\mathcal{M}_f)$ is precompact in $X_f$. In particular $\mathcal{M}_f$ is Carath\'eodory hyperbolic (i.e. bounded holomorphic functions separate points in $\mathcal{M}_f$), provided that $f$ is not flexible Latt\`es. This solves a conjecture of McMullen. When $d\geq 4$, we give a concrete construction of $X_f$ as the normalization of the Zariski closure of the image of the reciprocal multiplier spectrum morphism.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations of the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Allen--Cahn equation, a prototypical model problem in nonlinear dynamics that exhibits bifurcations corresponding to variations of a deterministic bifurcation parameter. Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we introduce a random coefficient function in the linear reaction part of the equation, thereby accounting for random, spatially-heterogeneous effects. Importantly, we assume a spatially constant, deterministic mean value of the random coefficient. We show that this mean value is in fact a bifurcation parameter in the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients. Moreover, we show that the bifurcation points and bifurcation curves become random objects. We consider two distinct modelling situations: (i) for a spatially homogeneous coefficient we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of the bifurcation points and show that the bifurcation curves are random shifts of a fixed reference curve; (ii) for a spatially heterogeneous coefficient we employ a generalized polynomial chaos expansion to approximate the statistical properties of the random bifurcation points and bifurcation curves. We present numerical examples in 1D physical space, where we combine the popular software package Continuation Core and Toolboxes (CoCo) for numerical continuation and the Sparse Grids Matlab Kit for the polynomial chaos expansion. Our exposition addresses both, dynamical systems and uncertainty quantification, highlighting how analytical and numerical tools from both areas can be combined efficiently for the challenging uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations in random differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We study how the field of definition of a rational function changes under iteration. We provide a complete classification of polynomials with the property that the field of definition of one of their iterates drops in degree (over a given base field). We show with families of examples that this characterization does not hold for rational functions. Finally, we also classify fractional linear transformations with this property.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian operator inference enhanced with structure-preserving machine learning for nonintrusive model reduction of mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex mechanical systems often exhibit strongly nonlinear behavior due to the presence of nonlinearities in the energy dissipation mechanisms, material constitutive relationships, or geometric/connectivity mechanics. Numerical modeling of these systems leads to nonlinear full-order models that possess an underlying Lagrangian structure. This work proposes a Lagrangian operator inference method enhanced with structure-preserving machine learning to learn nonlinear reduced-order models (ROMs) of nonlinear mechanical systems. This two-step approach first learns the best-fit linear Lagrangian ROM via Lagrangian operator inference and then presents a structure-preserving machine learning method to learn nonlinearities in the reduced space. The proposed approach can learn a structure-preserving nonlinear ROM purely from data, unlike the existing operator inference approaches that require knowledge about the mathematical form of nonlinear terms. From a machine learning perspective, it accelerates the training of the structure-preserving neural network by providing an informed prior, and it reduces the computational cost of the network training by operating on the reduced space. The method is first demonstrated on two simulated examples: a conservative nonlinear rod model and a two-dimensional nonlinear membrane with nonlinear internal damping. Finally, the method is demonstrated on an experimental dataset consisting of digital image correlation measurements taken from a lap-joint beam structure from which a predictive model is learned that captures amplitude-dependent frequency and damping characteristics accurately. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields generalizable nonlinear ROMs that exhibit bounded energy error, capture the nonlinear characteristics reliably, and provide accurate long-time predictions outside the training data regime.</description>

      <title>On a port-Hamiltonian formulation and structure-preserving numerical approximations for thermodynamic compressible fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high volatility of renewable energies calls for more energy efficiency. Thus, different physical systems need to be coupled efficiently although they run on various time scales. Here, the port-Hamiltonian (pH) modeling framework comes into play as it has several advantages, e.g., physical properties are encoded in the system structure and systems running on different time scales can be coupled easily. Additionally, pH systems coupled by energy-preserving conditions are still pH. Furthermore, in the energy transition hydrogen becomes an important player and unlike in natural gas, its temperature-dependence is of importance. Thus, we introduce an infinite dimensional pH formulation of the compressible non-isothermal Euler equations to model flow with temperature-dependence. We set up the underlying Stokes-Dirac structure and deduce the boundary port variables. We introduce coupling conditions into our pH formulation, such that the whole network system is pH itself. This is achieved by using energy-preserving coupling conditions, i.e., mass conservation and equality of total enthalpy, at the coupling nodes. Furthermore, to close the system a third coupling condition is needed. Here, equality of the outgoing entropy at coupling nodes is used and included into our systems in a structure-preserving way. Following that, we adapt the structure-preserving aproximation methods from the isothermal to the non-isothermal case. Academic numerical examples will support our analytical findings.</description>

      <title>Logic-dependent emergence of multistability, hysteresis, and biphasic dynamics in a minimal positive feedback network with an autoloop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular decision-making (CDM) is a dynamic phenomenon often controlled by regulatory networks defining interactions between genes and transcription factor proteins. Traditional studies have focussed on molecular switches such as positive feedback circuits that exhibit at most bistability. However, higher-order dynamics such as tristability is also prominent in many biological processes. It is thus imperative to identify a minimal circuit that can alone explain mono, bi, and tristable dynamics. In this work, we consider a two-component positive feedback network with an autoloop and explore these regimes of stability for different degrees of multimerization and the choice of Boolean logic functions. We report that this network can exhibit numerous dynamical scenarios such as bi-and tristability, hysteresis, and biphasic kinetics, explaining the possibilities of abrupt cell state transitions and the smooth state swap without a step-like switch. Specifically, while with monomeric regulation and competitive OR logic, the circuit exhibits mono-and bistability and biphasic dynamics, with non-competitive AND and OR logics only monostability can be achieved. To obtain bistability in the latter cases, we show that the autoloop must have (at least) dimeric regulation. In pursuit of higher-order stability, we show that tristability occurs with higher degrees of multimerization and with non-competitive OR logic only. Our results, backed by rigorous analytical calculations and numerical examples, thus explain the association between multistability, multimerization, and logic in this minimal circuit. Since this circuit underlies various biological processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition which often drives carcinoma metastasis, these results can thus offer crucial inputs to control cell state transition by manipulating multimerization and the logic of regulation in cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the random dynamical system $f_\omega^n$ generated by a family of maps $\{f_{\omega_0}: \mathbb{S}^1 \to \mathbb{S}^1\}_{\omega_0 \in [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]},$ $f_{\omega_0}(x) = \alpha \xi (x+\omega_0) +a\ (\mathrm{mod }\ 1),$ where $\xi: \mathbb S^1 \to \mathbb R$ is a non-degenerated map, $a\in [0,1)$, and $\alpha,\varepsilon&gt;0$. Fixing a constant $c\in (0,1)$, we show that for $\alpha$ sufficiently large and for $\varepsilon &gt; \alpha^{-1+c},$ the random dynamical system $f_\omega^n$ presents a random Young tower structure and quenched decay of correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a notion of random horseshoe for one-dimensional random dynamical systems. We prove the abundance of random horseshoes for a class of circle endomorphisms subject to additive noise, large enough to make the Lyapunov exponent positive. In particular, we provide conditions which guarantee that given any pair of disjoint intervals, for almost every noise realization, there exists a positive density sequence of return times to these intervals such that the induced dynamics are the full shift on two symbols.</description>

      <title>Dominated splitting from constant periodic data and global rigidity of Anosov automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a $\mathrm{GL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ cocycle over a hyperbolic system with constant periodic data has a dominated splitting whenever the periodic data indicates it should. This implies global periodic data rigidity of generic Anosov automorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^d$. Further, our approach also works when the periodic data is narrow, that is, sufficiently close to constant. We can show global periodic data rigidity for certain non-linear Anosov diffeomorphisms in a neighborhood of an irreducible Anosov automorphism with simple spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the local geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x}=F(x)$ with real time parameterization, where $F$ is holomorphic on connected open subsets of $\mathbb{C}\stackrel{\sim}{=}\mathbb{R}^2$. We describe the geometry of first-order equilibria. For equilibria of higher orders, we establish an equivalent condition for "definite directions", allowing us to reverse the implication in Theorem 2 of Chapter 2.10 in [Differential equations and dynamical systems, Lawrence Perko (1990)] under the additional condition of holomorphy. This enables the geometric construction of a finite elliptic decomposition. We derive a holomorphic Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type theorem, leading to the conclusion that bounded non-periodic orbits are always homoclinic or heteroclinic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homotopic-to-the-identity torus homeomorphisms, whose rotation set has nonempty interior. We prove that any such map is monotonically semiconjugate to a homeomorphism that preserves the Lebesgue measure, and that has the same rotation set. Furthermore, the dynamics of the quotient map has several interesting chaotic traits: for instance, it is topologically mixing, has a dense set of periodic points and is continuum-wise expansive. In particular, this shows that a convex compact set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with nonempty interior is the rotation set of the lift of a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{T}^2$ if and only if it is the rotation set of the lift of a conservative homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated Verification of Linear Time-Invariant Systems against Signal Temporal Logic Specifications via Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While reachability analysis is one of the most promising approaches for formal verification of dynamic systems, a major disadvantage preventing a more widespread application is the requirement to manually tune algorithm parameters such as the time step size. Manual tuning is especially problematic if one aims to verify that the system satisfies complicated specifications described by signal temporal logic formulas since the effect the tightness of the reachable set has on the satisfaction of the specification is often non-trivial to see for humans. We address this problem with a fully-automated verifier for linear systems, which automatically refines all parameters for reachability analysis until it can either prove or disprove that the system satisfies a signal temporal logic formula for all initial states and all uncertain inputs. Our verifier combines reachset temporal logic with dependency preservation to obtain a model checking approach whose over-approximation error converges to zero for adequately tuned parameters. While we in this work focus on linear systems for simplicity, the general concept we present can equivalently be applied for nonlinear and hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Dissipative Neural Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. The objective of this paper is to learn a neural dynamical model that approximates this system, while preserving the dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this work, we address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model in two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a neural dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>A constructive approach for investigating the stability of incommensurate fractional differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to generalized non-commensurate fractional systems. To this end, we first consider fractional systems with rational orders and introduce a criterion that is necessary and sufficient to ensure the stability of such systems. Next, from the fractional-order pseudospectrum definition proposed by \v{S}anca et al., we formulate the concept of a rational approximation for the fractional spectrum of a noncommensurate fractional systems with general, not necessarily rational, orders. Our first important new contribution is to show the equivalence between the fractional spectrum of a noncommensurate linear system and its rational approximation. With this result in hand, we use ideas developed in our earlier work to demonstrate the stability of an equilibrium point to nonlinear systems in arbitrary finite-dimensional spaces. A second novel aspect of our work is the fact that the approach is constructive. Finally, we give numerical simulations to illustrate the merit of the proposed theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dynamical systems from data without time labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the method to reconstruct dynamical systems from data without time labels. Data without time labels appear in many applications, such as molecular dynamics, single-cell RNA sequencing etc. Reconstruction of dynamical system from time sequence data has been studied extensively. However, these methods do not apply if time labels are unknown. Without time labels, sequence data becomes distribution data. Based on this observation, we propose to treat the data as samples from a probability distribution and try to reconstruct the underlying dynamical system by minimizing the distribution loss, sliced Wasserstein distance more specifically. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We study tiling spaces in the diffeological context. We prove some basic diffeological properties for tiling spaces and analyze two different fiber bundle structures of one-dimensional tiling spaces over the irrational torus. We use the diffeological classification of irrationatl tori which captures their arithmetical escence in order to inherit the diffeological equivalence in the context of tiling spaces.</description>

      <title>A novel analysis method for calculating nonlinear Frequency Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) are the most widely used functions to characterise the dynamic behaviour of structures. The natural frequencies and damping behaviour can be easily and quickly detected from a Bode diagram. The modal properties of FRFs can be evaluated using modal analysis methods, and as the last step, frequency response models can synthesise response functions to verify the robustness of the modal parameters identified by the analysis. The circularity between 1) measurement, 2) identification, 3) regeneration and 4) comparison is ensured on the assumption that transfer functions are measured under linear vibrations, even though mechanical systems are intrinsically non-linear. Some sources of nonlinearity might be excited and revealed, and others not for various reasons. Anyhow, it is unavoidable to measure non-linear vibrations when vibration tests are executed at various levels of excitation forces. Eventually, linear and non-linear vibrations are processed to obtain linear and non-linear FRFs. The linear FRFs are processed using the existing identification methods. The non-linear FRFs are archived or blandly processed to evaluate the level and the type of nonlinearity, such as hardening or softening behaviour. This research aims to (i) formulate a new analysis method to generate nonlinear frequency responses and (ii) formulate a new identification method for extracting amplitude-dependent modal parameters. The first objective will demonstrate that a nonlinear frequency response surface generated by linear FRFs is the solution space of nonlinear FRFs. The second objective will demonstrate that a linear modal analysis method called line-fit, based on the Dobson formulation, allows extracting amplitude-dependent modal parameters from non-linear FRFs.</description>
