      <title>Origin of pressure-induced anomalies in the nodal-line ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pressure-induced insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) has recently been discovered in the nodal-line ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. The electronic phase transition is accompanied by anomalies in the magnetic ordering temperature and the anomalous Hall conductivity, which peak at or near the critical pressure of the IMT. We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations as a function of pressure to reveal the driving factors behind the IMT and the magnetic anomalies in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. We extract Heisenberg Hamiltonians as a function of pressure based on our DFT calculations. Our classical Monte Carlo simulations for these Hamiltonians yield ordering temperatures and magnetic ordering patterns, in agreement with the experimental data. Although we can accurately explain the evolution of magnetism with pressure, it seems that the anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ cannot be accounted for by intrinsic contributions alone.</description>

      <title>SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Spectral Function of Moir\'e Graphene Heavy-Fermions Using Iterative Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral functions of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) in the absence of strain have recently been investigated in both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The theoretically predicted Mott-Hubbard bands and gapless semimetallic state at half-filling have since been confirmed experimentally. Here, we develop several second-order perturbation theory approaches to the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of TBG and twisted symmetric trilayer graphene (TSTG). In the symmetric phase, we adapt, implement, and benchmark an iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver within DMFT, enabling computationally efficient yet accurate spectral function calculations. We present momentum- and energy-resolved spectra over a broad range of temperatures and fillings for both symmetric and symmetry-broken states. In addition, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral function within the ``Hubbard-I'' approximation of the THF model and, as expected, find that while it provides a tractable description of Mott physics, it does not capture the low-energy Kondo peak or the finite lifetime broadening of the bands. Our methodology can be extended to include strain, lattice relaxation, and parameter variations, thereby allowing systematic predictions of TBG and TSTG spectral properties across a wide range of physical regimes. Because our perturbative approaches are far less computationally intensive than DMFT with numerically exact impurity solvers, they can be used to efficiently benchmark and scan extensive phase diagrams of the THF parameters, paving the way for full DMFT analyses of the TBG spectral function in the presence of strain and relaxation.</description>

      <title>Instability of Laughlin FQH liquids into gapless power-law correlated states with continuous exponents in ideal Chern bands: rigorous results from plasma mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of Laughlin's wave-function in ideal Chern bands which can be mapped to generalized zero Landau levels in spatially dependent magnetic fields. By exploiting its exact mapping onto a classical Coulomb gas and leveraging previous results of one-component plasmas in nonuniform neutralizing backgrounds, we demonstrate that the ideal Laughlin wave-function undergoes a phase transition from its well-known fully gapped topologically ordered plasma state into a power-law correlated dielectric state even for the fixed filling of $1/3$, as the magnetic field becomes increasingly more inhomogeneous. This dielectric state is gapless even though it does not spontaneously break translational symmetry. Remarkably, for a fixed filling $\nu=1/m$, the exponent governing density correlations in this state changes continuously as a function of the degree of spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, and can range from $4$ near a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the plasma state, up to $2 m$ in the limit of fields generated by point solenoids.</description>

      <title>Structures of group-15 elemental solids from an effective boundary theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective description for the crystal structures of pnictogen elemental solids. In these materials, each atom contains three valence electrons in $p$ orbitals. They are shared between neighbouring atoms to form valence bonds. We propose a trivalent network model on the simple cubic lattice. As a generalization of a dimer model, we impose a constraint that three dimers must touch every site. We argue that intra-orbital Coulomb repulsion prohibits the formation of two adjacent, parallel dimers. This leads to a tripod-like local configuration at every site. More importantly, it forces every line of the cubic lattice to have alternating dimers and blanks. There is no dynamics as dimers cannot be locally rearranged. A bulk-boundary mapping emerges whereby bonds in the interior are fully described by Ising variables on three bounding planes -- a simple example of holography that may be realized in real materials. To describe the energetics of bonding, we formulate a minimal model in terms of boundary Ising spins. Symmetries reduce the problem to that of three identical, independent, two-dimensional Ising models. An antiferromagnetic Ising-ground-state corresponds to the A7 structure seen in antimony and grey arsenic. An antiferromagnetic phase within a bilayer describes the structure of phosphorene. By stacking such bilayers, we obtain the A17 structure of black phosphorus. The stripe phase of the Ising models describes the cubic gauche structure of nitrogen. As a testable signature, we demonstrate that single impurities will induce long-ranged domain walls.</description>

      <title>The Frenkel line and the pseudogap: an analogy between classical and electronic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotically close to critical end-points of first-order transitions, maxima in thermodynamic quantities occur along a line called the Widom line, a concept first introduced in classical fluids. This concept has been extended to strongly correlated electronic fluids in the context of the Mott transition. Namely, upon increasing interaction strength in the Hubbard model at half-filling, one finds a first-order Mott metal-insulator transition with a critical end-point at high temperature above which a number of crossover lines are observable. Using the dynamical cluster approximation for the triangular-lattice Hubbard model, we compute the Frenkel line, another concept borrowed from classical fluids, useful to define a sharp crossover between the pseudogap and the correlated Fermi liquid. The Frenkel line in the electron fluid is defined by the appearance of back-scattering when entering the pseudogap. The signature of back-scattering is the existence of a negative value in the time-domain optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate magnetic order drives singular angular magnetoresistance in a Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a multi-$\mathbf{k}$ incommensurate magnetic state in the Weyl semimetal CeAlGe gives rise to singular angular magnetoresistance (SAMR), an electrical-transport signature that detects the magnetic-field direction with exceptional precision. In contrast, the sister compound CeAlSi shows neither multi-$\mathbf{k}$ order nor SAMR. Both phenomena emerge upon $\sim57\%$ Ge substitution in CeAlSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and coincide with electronic-structure changes that soften the single-ion in-plane anisotropy and enhance Weyl-mediated magnetic interactions. These results reveal a direct connection between band topology, electronic transport, and collective magnetism in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Observation via spin Seebeck effect of macroscopic magnetic transport from emergent magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, elusive in high-energy physics, have been realised as emergent quasiparticles in solid-state systems, where their unique properties hold promise for novel spintronic applications. Magnetic monopoles have been invoked in diverse platforms, including skyrmion lattices, chiral magnets, soft ferromagnets, aritifical nanomagnets. Yet, a demonstration of their role in magnetic transport has remained elusive. Here, we report such an observation via the spin Seebeck effect in the bulk insulating pyrochlore oxide, spin ice $\mathrm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$. By applying a thermal gradient perpendicular to a $[111]$-oriented magnetic field, we detect a transverse spin Seebeck voltage marked by a dominant peak at the onset of monopole proliferation, accompanied by a secondary feature and frequency-dependent behavior. Our findings establish a direct link between monopole dynamics and magnetic transport in an insulating medium, establishing a new pathway for probing fractionalized excitations and advancing towards novel spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Localized Excitons and Landau-Level Mixing in Time-Reversal Symmetric Pairs of Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Landau-level mixing in a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian composed of two sets of Landau levels with opposite magnetic field, relevant to moir\'e minibands in twisted homobilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in the adiabatic limit, where electrons in opposite valleys have flat Chern bands with opposite Chern numbers. Strong spin-orbit coupling polarizes spins in opposite directions in opposite valleys, separating Coulomb interactions into like-spin ($V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$) and opposite-spin ($V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$). Using degenerate perturbation theory, we compute Landau-level mixing corrections to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ and $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ for different filling fractions. In the lowest Landau level, screening exhibits an even-odd effect: $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is reduced more strongly than $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ in even-$m$ angular momentum Haldane pseudopotential and less strongly in odd-$m$ angular momentum ones. In the first Landau level, the short-range part ($m=0,1$) of $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ is reduced comparably to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$, while the strongest spin anisotropy appears in the $m=2$ pseudopotential. These novel short-range spin correlations have important implications for candidate correlated phases of fractional quantum spin Hall insulators. A distinctive feature of this time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian, absent in conventional quantum Hall systems, is that spin-flip excitations form localized quasiparticles. We compute their excitation spectrum and predict a non-monotonic dependence of the ordering temperature of Chern ferromagnetism in MoTe$_2$ on the Landau-level mixing parameter.</description>

      <title>Influence of La-doping on the magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-gapped system SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aliovalent doping of the two-dimensional dimer antiferromagnet SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has long been proposed as a potential route toward realizing resonating valence bond (RVB) superconductivity in this system; however, experimental progress has remained limited. This study explores the effects of La doping on the ground state of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and reports the first flux growth of Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$Cu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals with nominal doping levels up to $x$ = 0.15. Powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the successful incorporation of La on the Sr sites within the tetragonal $I\bar{4}2m$ structure, although the effective doping was limited to approximately 50% of the nominal concentration. La doping induces systematic changes in the magnetic properties, with a reduction of the effective spin gap $\Delta$ from ~28.2K to ~20.3 K at $x$ = 0.15, as determined from low-temperature magnetic susceptibility. X-band electron spin resonance measurements reveal the emergence of unpaired Cu$^{2+}$ spins in La-doped SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals, which develop antiferromagnetic correlations below ~5.5 K. These findings corroborate the breaking of the local spin dimers induced by La doping. Despite this, no superconductivity is observed across the entire doping range studied. The present study demonstrates that at low doping levels, electron doping locally destabilizes the spin-singlet ground state in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, while the intrinsic spin dynamics of the dimer lattice remain largely preserved.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-point-induced dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, the existence of exceptional points (EPs) depends not only on the details of the Hamiltonian but also on the particle-number filling and the particle statistics. In this paper, we study many-particle EPs in a Bose Hubbard chain with two end-site resonant imaginary potentials. Starting from a single-particle coalescing eigenstate, we construct $n$-particle condensate eigenstates for the cases with zero and infinite $U$. Compared with the free bosonic case, where the $ n $-particle condensate eigenstate is an $(n+1)$-th-order coalescing state, the hardcore-boson counterpart is a second-order coalescing state for odd $n$ , while it is not for even $n$. The difference in particle-number parity results in distinct quenching dynamics of the condensate states, highlighting the role of parity in system behavior. Our finding may stimulate research on the dynamic sensitivity to particle-number parity.</description>

      <title>Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Evidence for Electron-Boson Coupling in Half-metallic CrO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electronic structure of the half-metal ferromagnet CrO2 by means of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The observed clear Fermi surface (FS) and band dispersion are in good agreement with the previous reports. Moreover, the ARPES band dispersion reveals a distinct kink structure around 68 meV, providing the first evidence from the electronic structure for the elementary excitations in CrO2. The energy scale of this feature is comparable to the Debye temperature and the A1g phonon mode, suggesting the electron-phonon interaction. From the detailed analysis, we have extracted the self-energy and found two characteristic structures in the real part of the self-energy. Assuming the existence of the electron-magnon interaction as well as the electron-phonon interaction, we have simulated the line shape for the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy and reproduced the ARPES intensity. Our spectral findings demonstrate the renormalized quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in CrO2 and provide valuable insights into the fundamental many-body interactions governing half-metallic ferromagnets.</description>

In the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ system ktenasite, Cu$_\text{2.7}$Zn$_\text{2.3}$(SO$_\text{4}$)$_\text{2}$(OH)$_\text{6}\cdot$6H$_\text{2}$O, we show that structural disorder drives an unexpected dimensional crossover and stabilizes a rare coexistence of distinct magnetic states. Neutron diffraction reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f} = 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz. Our findings highlight ktenasite as a rare platform where structural disorder tunes the effective dimensionality and stabilizes coexisting ordered and glassy magnetic phases, offering a unique opportunity to explore the interplay of frustration, disorder, and dimensional crossover in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Layer controlled orbital selective Mott transition in monolayer nickelate</title>

Abstract: Dimensionality and electronic correlations are crucial elements of many quantum material properties. An example is the change of the electronic structure accompanied by the loss of quasiparticles when a metal is reduced from three dimensions to a lower dimension, where the Coulomb interaction between carriers becomes poorly screened. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report an orbital-selective decoherence of spectral density in the perovskite nickelate LaNiO3 towards the monolayer limit. The spectral weight of the dz2 band vanishes much faster than that of the dx2-y2 band as the thickness of the LaNiO3 layer is decreased to a single unit cell, indicating a stronger correlation effect for the former upon dimensional confinement. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations show an orbital-selective Mott transition largely due to the localization of dz2 electrons along the c axis in the monolayer limit. This orbital-selective correlation effect underpins many macroscopic properties of nickelates, such as metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity, where most theories are built upon a dx2-y2-dz2 two-band model.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric quantum oscillations and Zeeman splitting in topological Dirac semimetal BaAl$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological semimetals hosting Dirac or Weyl fermions are a new kind of materials class in which conduction and valence bands cross each other. Such materials harbor a nontrivial Berry phase, which is an additional geometrical phase factor arising along the path of an adiabatic surface and can give rise to experimentally measurable quantities such as an anomalous Hall component. Here we report a systematic study of quantum oscillations of thermoelectric power in single crystals of the topological Dirac nodal-line semimetal BaAl$_{4}$. We show that the thermoelectric power (TEP) is a sensitive probe of the multiple oscillation frequencies in this material, with two of these frequencies shown to originate from the three-dimensional Dirac band. The detected Berry phase provides evidence of the angular dependence and non-trivial state under high magnetic fields. We also have probed the signatures of Zeeman splitting, from which we have extracted the Land\'e $g$-factor for this system, providing further insight into the non-trivial topology of this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Photo-Induced Enhancement of Critical Temperature in a Phase Competing Spin-Fermion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation is known to destabilize long-range order in correlated systems, yet experiments have also reported the emergence of metastable phases, in some cases with enhanced critical temperatures. The microscopic origin of such light-induced stabilization remains unresolved. Here we investigate this problem within a minimal spin-fermion framework: a double-exchange model at half filling, augmented by ferromagnetic superexchange on a square lattice. In equilibrium, at half-filling the ordering temperature is set by the competition between kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism and superexchange-induced ferromagnetism. Using quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Brown dynamics for localized spins combined with mean-field evolution of itinerant electrons, we demonstrate a nonthermal mechanism for stabilizing ordered phases. Photoexcitation creates a long-lived nonequilibrium carrier population that resists thermalization and reshapes the low-energy landscape, converting kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism into ferromagnetism and enhancing the critical temperature. While model-specific, our results reveal a general microscopic pathway by which light can tip the balance between competing orders, suggesting routes toward optically engineered magnetism, charge-density-wave order, and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping transport in the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model is a simple low energy and long wavelength description of charge transport, parameterised by the current relaxation timescale $\tau$, charge diffusivity $D$ and charge compressibility $\chi$. We obtain sharp constraints on these parameters in terms of the microscopic energy and length scales of any underlying lattice model with local and bounded interactions. Our primary tools are upper bounds on the retarded Green's function for the charge density in such a setting. We first note that the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model cannot pertain at microscopic energy scales because it is inconsistent with the exponential suppression of spectral weight at the highest frequencies in a lattice model. Secondly, under the assumption that the low energy dynamics is captured by the model, we obtain a lower bound on the collective mean free path $\ell \equiv \sqrt{\tau D}$. This bound is shown to imply a version of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound: systems with $\ell$ much shorter than the lattice length scale cannot have conventional Drude peaks.</description>

      <title>Chiral Color Code : Single-shot error correction for exotic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of simple three-dimensional stabilizer codes, called the chiral color codes, that realize fermionic and chiral topological orders. In the qubit case, the code realizes the topological phase of a single copy of the fermionic toric code. For qudit systems with local dimension $d$, the model features a chiral parameter $\alpha$ and realizes 3D topological phases characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_d^{(\alpha)}$ anyon theories with anomalous chiral surface topological order. On closed manifolds, the code has a unique ground state after removing bulk transparent fermions or bosons. Furthermore, we prove that the bulk is short-range entangled (for odd $d$, coprime $\alpha$) by constructing an explicit local quantum channel that prepares the ground state. The chiral color codes are constructed within the gauge color code, and hence inherit its fault-tolerant features: they admit single-shot error correction and allow code switching to other stabilizer color codes. These properties position the chiral color codes as particularly useful platforms for realizing and manipulating fermions and chiral anyons.</description>

      <title>A scalable route to first-order response properties with correlated sampling phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To make useful connections with experimental measurements, correlated electronic structure theories must accurately predict chemical properties in addition to energies. We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach. Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to 18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of coherent nodal and antinodal dynamics in underdoped Bi-2212</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($&lt;$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of RCd3P3 (R: Ce or La) compounds: Insulator-metal transition induced by displacement of atoms in the unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examined the electronic structures and optical properties of single crystals of RCd3P3 (R = Ce or La). Our first-principles analysis indicates that CeCd3P3 and LaCd3P3 exhibit semiconductor characteristics with narrow energy gaps of approximately 0.51 and 0.70 eV, respectively. Notably, a slight displacement of the Cd and P atoms within the unit cell significantly transforms the electronic structure from insulating to metallic state. Optical spectroscopy of both compounds reveals a metallic state with a low charge carrier density, suggesting a finite density of states at the Fermi level. A comparison between the theoretical electronic structures and experimental optical properties elucidates the observed metallic behavior. Additionally, the notable modification of the infrared-active phonons strongly indicates a structural phase transition in these compounds. Our findings also suggest that CeCd3P3 serves as a suitable platform for investigating the photoinduced Kondo effect due to its metallic ground state with limited charge carriers.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous and Topological Hall Effect and Nernst Effect in a Dirac Kagome Magnet Fe3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for kagome magnets with unconventional magnetic and electronic properties has gained significant attention in recent years. We report the magnetic, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of Fe3Ge single crystals, where the Fe atoms form a slightly distorted kagome lattice. Fe3Ge exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect and anomalous Nernst effect. The anomalous transverse thermoelectric conductivity reaches about 4.6 A m^-1 K^-1, exceeding values reported for conventional ferromagnets and most topological ferromagnets. First-principles calculations indicate that these transport responses are primarily governed by intrinsic mechanisms, highlighting the dominant role of Berry curvature arising from massive Dirac gaps in momentum space. In addition, we observe a topological Hall resistivity of about 0.9 microOhm cm and a topological Nernst coefficient of 1.2 microvolt K^-1, which are attributed to the Berry phase associated with field-induced scalar spin chirality. These findings demonstrate the combined influence of Berry phases in both momentum and real space, establishing Fe3Ge as a promising candidate for room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Fingerprint: Interacting Driven Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation properties of quantum many-body systems are encoded in their response functions. These functions define an associated response Hamiltonian, which is intrinsically non-Hermitian due to the dissipative nature of retarded responses, even in closed systems. By analyzing its eigenvalues and eigenstates, one obtains a unique characterization of the system, referred to as the complex frequency fingerprint. Using this framework, we demonstrate that interactions alone can give rise to both point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike the dissipation-induced skin effect, this interaction-driven phenomenon exhibits pronounced frequency dependence. We further introduce a complex-frequency density of states framework that distinctly separates non-Hermitian skin modes from topological edge modes.</description>

      <title>Non-Lagrangian phases of matter from Wilsonian renormalization of 3D Wess-Zumino-Witten theory on Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the renormalization of D-dimensional level-k Wess-Zumino-Witten theory with Stiefel-manifold target space $\mathrm{St}_{N,N-D-1} \cong \mathrm{SO}(N)/\mathrm{SO}(D+1)$, with a particular focus on $D = 3$. I investigate in particular whether such a theory admits IR-stable fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Such fixed points have been suggested to describe conformal phases of matter that do not have a known dual (super-)renormalizable Lagrangian for $N \geq 7$ in $D = 3$. They are hence of interest both from the point of view of quantum phases of matter as well as pure field theory. The $D$-dimensional expressions enable the computation, by analytic computation, of beta functions in $D = 2 + \epsilon$, at least to first non-trivial order. In $D = 2$, a stable fixed point is found, serving a generalization of the famed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory; it annihilates in $D = 2 + \epsilon$ with an unstable fixed point which splits off from the Gaussian one for $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Although the story is thus qualitatively similar to that of SO(5) deconfined (pseudo-)criticality, for $N \geqslant 6$, the annihilation appears to occur only for $\epsilon &gt; 1$, suggesting the existence of a stable phase in $D = 3$. Comparisons of the scaling dimension of the lowest singlet operator are made with known results for $N = 6$, which is dual to QED$_3$ with $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ fermion flavors. The predictions for the $N = 7$ Stiefel liquid represent to my knowledge the first computation of this kind for a Wess-Zumino-Witten theory without a known gauge theory dual.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations between excitonic and quantum spin Hall insulators in moir\'e WSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) and excitonic insulators (EIs) are prototypical topological and correlated states of matter, respectively. The topological phase transition between the two has attracted much theoretical interest but experimental studies have been hindered by the availability of tunable materials that can access such a transition. Here, by utilizing the interaction-enhanced g-factor and the flat moir\'e bands in twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2), we realize tunable electron-like and hole-like Landau levels (LLs) in the opposite valleys of tWSe2 under a perpendicular magnetic field. At half-band-filling, which corresponds to electron-hole charge neutrality, periodic oscillations between QSHIs (for fully filled LLs) and EIs (for half-filled LLs) are observed due to the interplay between the cyclotron energy and the intervalley correlation; QSHIs with up to four pairs of helical edge states can be resolved. We further analyze the effect of Fermi surface nesting on the stability of EIs via electric field-tuning of the moir\'e band structure. Our results demonstrate a novel QSHI-to-EI topological phase transition and provide a comprehensive understanding of the fermiology of tWSe2.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Mott Gap Softening Coinciding with Spin Correlations Collapse in a-RuCl3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced Diffusion Transport in Flat-band Systems with Quantum Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a 1D Lieb lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.</description>

      <title>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>1D Transition Metal Oxide Chains as a Challenging Model for Ab Initio Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible symmetry and topological holography for modulated SPT in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine noninvertible symmetry (NIS) in one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by dipolar and exponential-charge symmetries, which are two key examples of modulated SPT (MSPT). To set the stage, we first study NIS in the $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ cluster model, extending previous work on the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ case. For each symmetry type (charge, dipole, exponential), we explicitly construct the noninvertible Kramers-Wannier (KW) and Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations, revealing dual models with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The resulting symmetry group structure of the SSB model is rich enough that it allows the identification of other SSB models with the same symmetry. Using these alternative SSB models and KT duality, we generate novel MSPT phases distinct from those associated with the standard decorated domain wall picture, and confirm their distinctiveness by projective symmetry analyses at their interfaces. Additionally, we establish a topological-holographic correspondence by identifying the 2D bulk theories-two coupled layers of toric codes (charge), anisotropic dipolar toric codes (dipole), and exponentially modulated toric codes (exponential)-whose boundaries host the respective 1D MSPT phases.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Magnetism and Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism protected by symmetry(s) other than parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) and a resulting spin-split band, has been studied exclusively in crystalline materials. Here, we extend the framework of AM to quasicrystals (QCs). We start from a comparison between the N\'{e}el state on the square lattice and that on a $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QC, with both belonging to the same $d$-wave irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_4$ point group. Consequently, while the former is antiferromagnetism (AFM) protected by the combined $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ and translational symmetry, the lack of translational symmetry in the latter breaks the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, and the additional mirror or rotation symmetry protects AM. This example suggests that AM is more common in QCs than in crystals and can be easily explored through a point-group symmetry-based classification. Therefore, we classify magnetic phases in 2D $D_n$-symmetric QCs without spin-orbit coupling, by using IRRPs of $D_n$. Consequently, the identity IRRP represents ferromagnetism, the inversion-odd 1D IRRPs for twice-of-odd $n$ represent AFM, and all the remaining 1D IRRPs represent AM, protected by either mirror or rotation symmetry. We further take the Hubbard model to verify this result in various QCs with different symmetries. Our work highlights the QC as a natural platform where AM is common among magnetic phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.</description>

We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan (NY) anomaly using holography, finding that the U(1) axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We show that the axial response associated with the NY term is distinct from the chiral vortical effect and exhibits a characteristic $T^2$ dependence. Torsion-induced axial transport decouples spin and axial charge dynamics, thereby clarifying the physical significance of the NY anomaly and motivating further field-theoretic and holographic studies.</description>

Abstract: We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <title>Chiral order emergence driven by quenched disorder</title>

Abstract: Quenched disorder can destroy magnetic order, for example when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional Ising model. Even when an order exists in the presence of quenched disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order emerges, driven by quenched disorder. This order has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. This type of \textit{order by disorder} differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with site dilution. After analyzing the effect of a few vacancies on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the absence of vacancies.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moir\'es using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moir\'e materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moir\'e bands. For small twists ($\lesssim 5^\circ$) the density of states versus filling and interlayer bias displays qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking with tunable Van Hove singularities (VHSs). Moreover, interactions pin the VHS to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping both at zero and finite bias depending on the stacking type, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. At half filling, we obtain the phase diagram as a function of interaction strength, interlayer bias, and twist angle. We find a competition driven by band mixing between an isotropic ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet that are nearly degenerate over a wide range of experimentally accessible parameters. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1T tTMDs can be strongly tuned in situ both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators</title>

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</description>
