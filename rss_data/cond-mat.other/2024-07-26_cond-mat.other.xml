      <title>Tunneling time in coupled-channel systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In present work, we present a couple-channel formalism for the description of tunneling time of a quantum particle through a composite compound with multiple energy levels or a complex structure that can be reduced to a quasi-one-dimensional multiple-channel system.</description>

      <title>An All-encompassing Theory on Charge Transport in Spin Crossover Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly promising candidates for a myriad of potential applications in room-temperature electronics; however, as it stands, establishing a clear connection between their spin-state switching and transport properties has been far from trivial. In this Viewpoint, an effort to unravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a general theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a unifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the spin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin film systems.</description>

      <title>SO($N$) singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study of a nearest-neighbor, singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice that exhibits SO($N$) symmetry and is sign-problem-free. We find that in contrast to the previously studied two-dimensional variations of this model that harbor critical points between their ground state phases, the non-bipartite pyrochlore lattice in three spatial dimensions appears to exhibit a first-order transition between a magnetically-ordered phase and some, as yet uncharacterized, paramagnetic phase. We also observe that the magnetically-ordered phase survives to a relatively large value of $N=8$, and that it is gone for $N=9$.</description>

      <title>Ambiguous Resonances in Multipulse Quantum Sensing with Nitrogen Vacancy Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling multipulse sequences can be applied to solid state spins for sensing weak oscillating fields from nearby single nuclear spins. By periodically reversing the probing system's evolution, other noises are counteracted and filtered out over the total evolution. However, the technique is subject to intricate interactions resulting in additional resonant responses, which can be misinterpreted with the actual signal intended to be measured. We experimentally characterized three of these effects present in single nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, where we also developed a numerical simulations model without rotating wave approximations, showing robust correlation to the experimental data. Regarding centers with the $^{15}$N nitrogen isotope, we observed that a small misalignment in the bias magnetic field causes the precession of the nitrogen nuclear spin to be sensed by the electronic spin of the center. Another studied case of ambiguous resonances comes from the coupling with lattice $^{13}$C nuclei, where we reconstructed the interaction Hamiltonian based on echo modulation frequencies and used this Hamiltonian to simulate multipulse sequences. Finally, we also measured and simulated the effects from the free evolution of the quantum system during finite pulse durations. Due to the large data volume and the strong dependency of these ambiguous resonances with specific experimental parameters, we provide a simulations dataset with a user-friendly graphical interface, where users can compare simulations with their own experimental data for spectral disambiguation. Although focused with nitrogen vacancy centers and dynamical decoupling sequences, these results and the developed model can potentially be applied to other solid state spins and quantum sensing techniques.</description>
