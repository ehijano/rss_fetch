      <title>Quantifying the Errors Introduced by Continuum Scattering Models on the Inferred Structural Properties of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic force fields that are tuned to describe folded proteins predict overly compact structures for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To correct this, improvements in force fields to better model IDPs are usually paired with scattering models for validation against experiments. For scattering calculations, protein configurations from all-atom simulations are used within the continuum-solvent model CRYSOL for comparison with experiments. To check this approach, we develop an equation to evaluate the radius of gyration (Rg) for any defined inner-hydration shell thickness given all-atom simulation data. Rg based on an explicit description of hydration waters compares well with the reference value of Rg obtained using Guinier analysis of the all-atom scattering model. However, these internally consistent estimates disagree with Rg from CRYSOL for the same definition of the inner-shell. CRYSOL can over-predict Rg by up to 2.5 Angstroms. We rationalize the reason for this behavior and highlight the consequences for force field design.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and quantum electrodynamics effects on NMR shielding tensors of Tl$X$ ($X$ = H, F, Cl, Br, I, At) molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of relativistic calculations of nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensors ($\sigma$) for the thallium monocation (Tl$^+$), thallium hydride (TlH) and thallium halides (TlF, TlCl, TlBr, TlI, and TlAt) are presented as obtained within a four-component polarization propagator formalism and a two-component linear response approach within the zeroth-order regular approximation. Additionally, some quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects on those NMR shieldings are estimated. A strong dependence of $\sigma$(Tl) on the bonding partner is found, together with a very weak dependence of QED effects with them. In order to explain the trends observed, the excitation patterns associated with relativistic $ee$ (or paramagnetic-like) and $pp$ (or diamagnetic-like) contributions to $\sigma$ are analyzed. For this purpose, also the electronic spin-free and spin-dependent contributions are separated within the two-component zeroth-order regular approximation, and the influence of spin-orbit coupling on involved molecular orbitals is studied, which allows for a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Highly spin-polarized molecules via collisional microwave pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general technique to produce cold spin-polarized molecules, in which rotationally excited states are first populated by coherent microwave excitation, and then allowed to spin-flip and relax via collisional quenching, which populates a single final spin state. We illustrate the high selectivity of the technique for $^{13}$C$^{16}$O molecules immersed in a cold buffer gas of helium atoms, achieving a high degree ($\geq$95\%) of nuclear spin polarization at 1 K.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the quantum inverse algorithm on small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the accuracy of the quantum inverse (Q-Inv) algorithm in which the multiplication of $\hat{H}^{-k}$ to the reference wavefunction is replaced by the Fourier Transformed multiplication of $e^{-i\lambda \hat{H}}$, as a function of the integration parameters ($\lambda$) and the power $k$ for various systems, including H$_2$, LiH, BeH$_2$ and the notorious H$_4$ molecule at single point. We further consider the possibility of employing the Gaussian-quadrature rule as an alternate integration method and compared it to the results employing trapezoidal integration. The Q-Inv algorithm is compared to the inverse iteration method using the $\hat{H}^{-1}$ inverse (I-Iter) and the exact inverse by lower-upper decomposition (LU). Energy values are evaluated as the expectation values of the Hamiltonian. Results suggest that the Q-Inv method provides lower energy results than the I-Iter method up to a certain $k$, after which the energy increases due to errors in the numerical integration that are dependent of the integration interval. A combined Gaussian-quadrature and trapezoidal integration method proved to be more effective at reaching convergence while decreasing the number of operations. For systems like H$_4$, in which the Q-Inv can not reach the expected error threshold, we propose a combination of Q-Inv and I-Iter methods to further decrease the error with $k$ at lower computational cost. Finally, we summarize the recommended procedure when treating unknown systems.</description>

      <title>Time evolution as an optimization problem: The hydrogen atom in strong laser fields in a basis of time-dependent Gaussian wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in attosecond science have made it increasingly important to develop stable, reliable and accurate algorithms and methods to model the time evolution of atoms and molecules in intense laser fields. A key process in attosecond science is high-harmonic generation, which is challenging to model with fixed Gaussian basis sets, as it produces high-energy electrons, with a resulting rapidly varying and highly oscillatory wave function that extends over dozens of {\aa}ngstr\"om. Recently, Rothe's method, where time evolution is rephrased as an optimization problem, has been applied to the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. Here, we apply Rothe's method to the hydrogen wave function and demonstrate that complex-valued Gaussian wave packets with time-dependent width, center, and momentum parameters are able to reproduce spectra obtained from essentially exact grid calculations for high-harmonic generation with only 50-181 Gaussians for field strengths up to $5\times 10^{14}$W/cm$^2$. This paves the way for the inclusion of continuum contributions into real-time, time-dependent electronic-structure theory with Gaussian basis sets for strong fields, and eventually accurate simulations of the time evolution of molecules without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Trapping and Embrittlement in Metals -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement in metals (HE) is a serious challenge for the use of high strength materials in engineering practice and a major barrier to the use of hydrogen for global decarbonization. Here we describe the factors and variables that determine HE susceptibility and provide an overview of the latest understanding of HE mechanisms. We discuss hydrogen uptake and how it can be managed. We summarize hydrogen trapping and the techniques used for its characterization. We also review literature that argues that hydrogen trapping can be used to decrease HE susceptibility. We discuss the future research that is required to advance the understanding of HE and hydrogen trapping and to develop HE-resistant alloys.</description>

      <title>Orbital optimisation in xTC transcorrelated methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combination of the bi-orthogonal orbital optimisation framework with the recently introduced xTC version of transcorrelation. This allows us to implement non-iterative perturbation based methods on top of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Besides, the orbital optimisation influences results of other truncated methods, such as the distinguishable cluster with singles and doubles. The accuracy of these methods in comparison to standard xTC methods is demonstrated, and the advantages and disadvantages of the orbital optimisation are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The symmetric top molecule YbOCH$_3$ is studied for its potential to $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violation searches. The influence of the rotations and vibrations of the YbOCH$_3$ on such violating effects as the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) and the scalar-pseudoscalar electron-nucleon interaction (Ne-SPS) is studied using the coupled channels method. The corresponding sensitivity parameters $E_{\rm eff}$ and $E_{\rm s}$ are computed.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetic and Optical Properties in MnxZn1-xPS3 Single Crystals by the Alloying Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials has shown great promise and interest in tuning the magnetic and electronic properties as well as studying magneto-optical effects. The current work investigates the control of magneto-optical interactions in alloyed MnxZn1-xPS3 lamellar semiconductor single crystals, with the Mn/Zn ratio regulating the coupling strength. Magnetic susceptibility results show a retention of AFM order followed by a decrease in N\'eel temperatures down to ~ 40% Mn concentration, below which a paramagnetic behavior is observed. Absorption measurements reveal an increase in bandgap energy with higher Zn(II) concentration, and the presence of Mn(II) d-d transition below the absorption edge. DFT+U approach qualitatively explained the origin and the position of the experimentally observed mid band-gap states in pure MnPS3, and corresponding peaks visible in the alloyed systems MnxZn1-xPS3. Accordingly, emission at 1.3 eV in all alloyed compounds results from recombination from a 4T1g Mn(II) excited state to a hybrid p-d state at the valence band. Most significant, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity trends demonstrate strong magneto-optical coupling in compositions with x &gt; 0.65. This study underscores the potential of tailored alloy compositions as a means to control magnetic and optical properties in 2D materials, paving the way for advances in spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Low-symmetry polymorph of GaP upends bonding paradigms of metallic high-pressure III-V compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pressure-induced polymorphism of binary octect compounds has long been considered a settled problem although the possible atomic disordering of some phases remains a puzzling observation. Taking GaP as a case study, we conclude, through x-ray microdiffraction and first-principles calculations, that its high-pressure phase II (previously reported as being disordered) adopts in fact an ordered base-centered monoclinic structure previously unknown in this class of compounds. The formation of layered patterns with variable degrees of interlayer dimerization, as observed in GaP, marks a paradigm shift of our understanding of ordering in octect high-pressure phases which calls for a more extensive re-examination. A rich polymorphism with fine tuning of chemical and physical properties can be envisioned.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of atomic positions scheme.</description>

      <title>W4$\Lambda$: leveraging $\Lambda$ coupled cluster for accurate computational thermochemistry approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-accuracy composite wavefunction methods like Weizmann-4 (W4) theory, high-accuracy extrapolated \textit{ab initio} thermochemistry (HEAT), and Feller-Peterson-Dixon (FPD) enable sub-kJ/mol accuracy in gas-phase thermochemical properties. Their biggest computational bottleneck is the evaluation of the valence post-CCSD(T) correction term. We demonstrate here, for the W4-17 thermochemistry benchmark and subsets thereof, that the lambda coupled cluster expansion converges more rapidly and smoothly than the regular coupled cluster series. By means of CCSDT(Q)$_\Lambda$ and CCSDTQ(5)$_\Lambda$, we can considerably (up to an order of magnitude) accelerate W4- and W4.3-type calculations without loss in accuracy, leading to the W4$\Lambda$ and W4.3$\Lambda$ computational thermochemistry protocols.</description>

      <title>Generating High-Precision Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations to Study Chemical Reaction Mechanisms using Molecular Configuration Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on chemical reaction mechanisms have been crucial in organic chemistry. Traditionally, calculating the manually constructed molecular conformations of transition states for chemical reactions using quantum chemical calculations is the most commonly used method. However, this way is heavily dependent on individual experience and chemical intuition. In our previous study, we proposed a research paradigm that uses enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations to study chemical reactions. This approach can directly simulate the entire process of a chemical reaction. However, the computational speed limits the use of high-precision potential energy functions for simulations. To address this issue, we present a scheme for training high-precision force fields for molecular modeling using a previously developed graph-neural-network-based molecular model, molecular configuration transformer. This potential energy function allows for highly accurate simulations at a low computational cost, leading to more precise calculations of the mechanism of chemical reactions. We applied this approach to study a Claisen rearrangement reaction and a Carbonyl insertion reaction catalyzed by Manganese.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Band Gap Problem with a Machine-Learned Exchange Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systematic underestimation of band gaps is one of the most fundamental challenges in semilocal density functional theory (DFT). In addition to hindering the application of DFT to predicting electronic properties, the band gap problem is intimately related to self-interaction and delocalization errors, which make the study of charge transfer mechanisms with DFT difficult. In this work, we present two key innovations to address the band gap problem. First, we design an approach for machine learning density functionals based on Gaussian processes to explicitly fit single-particle energy levels. Second, we introduce novel nonlocal features of the density matrix that are expressive enough to fit these single-particle levels. Combining these developments, we train a machine-learned functional for the exact exchange energy that predicts molecular energy gaps and reaction energies of a wide range of molecules in excellent agreement with reference hybrid DFT calculations. In addition, while being trained solely on molecular data, our model predicts reasonable formation energies of polarons in solids, showcasing its transferability and robustness. Our approach generalizes straightforwardly to full exchange-correlation functionals, thus paving the way to the design of novel state-of-the-art functionals for the prediction of electronic properties of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Performant Automatic Differentiation of Local Coupled Cluster Theories: Response Properties and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a differentiable implementation of the local natural orbital coupled cluster (LNOCC) method within the automatic differentiation framework of the PySCFAD package. The implementation is comprehensively tuned for enhanced performance, which enables the calculation of first-order static response properties on medium-sized molecular systems using coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. We evaluate the accuracy of our method by benchmarking it against the canonical CCSD(T) reference for nuclear gradients, dipole moments, and geometry optimizations. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of property calculations for chemically interesting systems through the computation of bond orders and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy parameters for a [NiFe]-hydrogenase active site model, along with the simulation of infrared (IR) spectra via ab initio LNO-CC molecular dynamics for a protonated water hexamer.</description>

      <title>Coupling Molecular Density Functional Theory with Converged Selected Configuration Interaction Methods to Study Excited states in Aqueous Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first implementation of a coupling between advanced wave function theories and molecular density functional theory (MDFT). This method enables the modeling of solvent effect into quantum mechanical (QM) calculations by incorporating an electrostatic potential generated by solvent charges into the electronic Hamiltonian. Solvent charges are deduced from the spatially and angularly dependent solvent particle density. Such density is obtained through the minimization of the functional associated to the molecular mechanics (MM) Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the fluid particles. The introduced QM/MDFT framework belongs to QM/MM family of methods but its originality lies in the use of MDFT as the MM solver, offering two main advantages. Firstly, its functional formulation makes it competitive with respect to sampling-based molecular mechanics. Secondly, it preserves a molecular-level description lost in macroscopic continuum approaches. Excited states properties of water and formaldehyde molecules solvated into water have been computed at the selected configuration interaction (SCI) level. Excitation energies and dipole moment have been compared with experimental data and previous theoretical work. A key finding is that using the Hartree-Fock method to describe the solute allows for predicting the solvent charge around the ground-state with sufficient precision for the subsequent SCI calculations of excited-states. This significantly reduces the computational cost of the described procedure, paving the way for the study of more complex molecules.</description>

      <title>Unified understanding of the breakdown of thermal mixing dynamic nuclear polarization: the role of temperature and radical concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal an interplay between temperature and radical concentration necessary to establish thermal mixing (TM) as an efficient dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) mechanism. We conducted DNP experiments by hyperpolarizing widely used DNP samples, i.e., sodium pyruvate-1-$^{13}$C in water/glycerol mixtures at varying nitroxide radical (TEMPOL) concentrations and microwave irradiation frequencies, measuring proton and carbon-13 spin temperatures. Using a cryogen consumption-free prototype-DNP apparatus, we could probe cryogenic temperatures between 1.5 and 6.5 K, i.e., below and above the boiling point of liquid helium. We identify two mechanisms for the breakdown of TM: (i) Anderson type of quantum localization for low radical concentration, or (ii) quantum Zeno localization occurring at high temperature. This observation allowed us to reconcile the recent diverging observations regarding the relevance of TM as a DNP mechanism by proposing a unifying picture and, consequently, to find a trade-off between radical concentration and electron relaxation times, which offers a pathway to improve experimental DNP performance based on TM.</description>

      <title>Requirements for probing chiral Casimir-Polder forces in a molecular Talbot-Lau interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of chiral Casimir-Polder (CP) forces in Talbot-Lau interferometry, based on three nanomechanical gratings. We study scenarios where the second grating is either directly written into a chiral material or where the nanomask is coated with chiral substances. We show requirements for probing enantiospecific effects in matter-wave interferometry in the transmission signal and the interference fringe visibility, which depend on the de Broglie wavelength and the molecular chirality. The proposed setup is particularly sensitive to CP forces in the non-retarded regime where chiral effects can be comparable in magnitude to their electric and magnetic counterparts. While the first and third gratings do not change the phase of the matter wave, applying a coating of chiral substances to them enhances the instrument's chiral selectivity.</description>
