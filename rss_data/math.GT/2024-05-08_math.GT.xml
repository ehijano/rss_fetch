      <title>Legendrian knots and multi-crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown in arXiv:1208.5742 that any smooth knot can be represented by an \"ubercrossing projection, i.e. a knot projection with no crossings aside from a single multi-crossing. We extend this idea to Legendrian knots and investigate \"ubercrossing and petal projections in the front and Lagrangian projections. We show that any Legendrian knot with an \"ubercrossing projection in the front projection is smoothly isotopic to the unknot and we demonstrate how to compute the $tb$ and rotation numbers for petal projections in the Lagrangian projection.</description>

      <title>Non-orientable 4-genus of torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-orientable 4-genus of a knot $K$ in $S^{3}$, denoted $\gamma_4(K)$, measures the minimum genus of a non-orientable surface in $B^{4}$ bounded by $K$. We compute bounds for the non-orientable 4-genus of knots $T_{5, q}$ and $T_{6, q}$, extending previous research. Additionally, we provide a generalized, non-recursive formula for $d(S^{3}_{-1}(T_{p,q}))$, the $d$-invariant of -1-surgery on torus knots.</description>

      <title>Expansion and torsion homology of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold is a called a good rational expander in dimension $i$ if every $i$-cycle bounds a rational $i+1$-chain of comparatively small volume. We construct 3-manifolds which are good expanders in all dimensions. On the other hand, we show that expanders must be topologically complicated: they must have lots of torsion homology. We also give some applications to topological overlap problems, constructing examples of 3-manifolds with large width over $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

      <title>Uniform degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces with boundary along harmonic map rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unique harmonic maps between surfaces give a parametrization of the Teichm\"{u}ller space by holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface. In this paper, we investigate the degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces corresponding to a ray of meromorphic quadratic differentials on a punctured Riemann surface in this parametrization, where the meromorphic quadratic differentials have a pole of order $\geq 2$ at each puncture. We show that the rescaled distance functions of the universal covers of hyperbolic surfaces uniformly converge, on a certain non-compact region containing a fundamental domain, to the intersection number with the vertical measured foliation given by the meromorphic quadratic differential determining the direction of the ray. This implies the family of hyperbolic surfaces converges to the dual $\mathbb{R}$-tree to the vertical measured foliation in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. As an application, we describe the limit in the function space on the set of isotopy classes of properly embedded arcs and simple closed curves on the surface.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Horofunction Compactification as a Polyhedral Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.00564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we answer positively a question raised by Kapovich and Leeb in a paper titled "Finsler bordifications of symmetric and certain locally symmetric spaces". Specifically, we show that for a finite-dimensional vector space with a polyhedral norm, its horofunction compactification is homeomorphic to the dual unit ball of the norm by an explicit map. To prove this, we establish a criterion for converging sequences in the horofunction compactification and generalize the basic notion of the moment map in the theory of toric varieties.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of Farey words and their traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of 3-variable "Farey polynomials" that are closely connected with the geometry and topology of $3$-manifolds and orbifolds as they can be used to produce concrete realisations of the boundaries and local coordinates for one-complex-dimensional deformation spaces of Kleinian groups. As such, this family of polynomials has a number of quite remarkable properties. We study these polynomials from an abstract combinatorial viewpoint, including a recursive definition extending that which is known in the literature for the special case of manifolds, even beyond what the geometry predicts. We also present some intriguing examples and conjectures which we would like to bring to the attention of researchers interested in algebraic combinatorics and hypergeometric functions.
  The results in this paper additionally provide a practical approach to various classification problems for rank-two subgroups of PSL(2,C) since they, together with other recent work of the authors, make it possible to provide certificates that certain groups are discrete and free, and effective ways to identify relators.</description>

      <title>Degenerations Of Skein Algebras And Quantum Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a joint generalization, called LRY skein algebras, of Kauffman bracket skein algebras (of surfaces) that encompasses both Roger-Yang skein algebras and stated skein algebras. We will show that, over an arbitrary ground ring which is a commutative domain, the LRY skein algebras are domains and have degenerations (by filtrations) equal to monomial subalgebras of quantum tori. For surfaces without interior punctures, this integrality generalizes a result of Moon and Wong to the most general ground ring. We also calculate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of LRY algebras and show they are Noetherian if the ground ring is. Moreover they are orderly finitely generated. To study the LRY algebras and prove the above-mentioned results, we construct quantum traces, both the so-called X-version for all surfaces and also an A-version for a smaller class of surfaces. We also introduce a modified version of Dehn-Thurston coordinates for curves which are more suitable for the study of skein algebras as they pick up the highest degree terms of products in certain natural filtrations.</description>

      <title>The covariance metric in the Blaschke locus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Blaschke locus has the structure of a finite dimensional smooth manifold away from the Teichm{\"u}ller space and study its Riemannian manifold structure with respect to the covariance metric introduced by Guillarmou, Knieper and Lefeuvre in \cite{GeodesicStretch}. We also identify some families of geodesics in the Blaschke locus arising from Hitchin representations for orbifolds and show that they have infinite length with respect to the covariance metric.</description>

      <title>Congruence subgroups of braid groups and crystallographic quotients. Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first of a two part series devoted to describing relations between congruence and crystallographic braid groups. We recall and introduce some elements belonging to congruence braid groups and we establish some (iso)-morphisms between crystallographic braid groups and corresponding quotients of congruence braid groups.</description>
